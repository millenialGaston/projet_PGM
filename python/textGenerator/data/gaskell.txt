
Three years ago I became anxious (from circumstances that need not be
more fully alluded to) to employ myself in writing a work of fiction.
Living in Manchester, but with a deep relish and fond admiration for
the country, my first thought was to find a frame-work for my story
in some rural scene; and I had already made a little progress in a
tale, the period of which was more than a century ago, and the place
on the borders of Yorkshire, when I bethought me how deep might be
the romance in the lives of some of those who elbowed me daily in the
busy streets of the town in which I resided. I had always felt a deep
sympathy with the care-worn men, who looked as if doomed to struggle
through their lives in strange alternations between work and want;
tossed to and fro by circumstances, apparently in even a greater
degree than other men. A little manifestation of this sympathy, and
a little attention to the expression of feelings on the part of some
of the work-people with whom I was acquainted, had laid open to me
the hearts of one or two of the more thoughtful among them; I saw
that they were sore and irritable against the rich, the even tenor
of whose seemingly happy lives appeared to increase the anguish
caused by the lottery-like nature of their own. Whether the bitter
complaints made by them, of the neglect which they experienced from
the prosperous--especially from the masters whose fortunes they had
helped to build up--were well-founded or no, it is not for me to
judge. It is enough to say, that this belief of the injustice and
unkindness which they endure from their fellow-creatures, taints what
might be resignation to God's will, and turns it to revenge in too
many of the poor uneducated factory-workers of Manchester.

The more I reflected on this unhappy state of things between those
so bound to each other by common interests, as the employers and
the employed must ever be, the more anxious I became to give some
utterance to the agony which, from time to time, convulses this dumb
people; the agony of suffering without the sympathy of the happy, or
of erroneously believing that such is the case. If it be an error,
that the woes, which come with ever-returning tide-like flood to
overwhelm the workmen in our manufacturing towns, pass unregarded
by all but the sufferers, it is at any rate an error so bitter in
its consequences to all parties, that whatever public effort can do
in the way of legislation, or private effort in the way of merciful
deeds, or helpless love in the way of "widow's mites," should be
done, and that speedily, to disabuse the work-people of so miserable
a misapprehension. At present they seem to me to be left in a state,
wherein lamentations and tears are thrown aside as useless, but in
which the lips are compressed for curses, and the hands clenched and
ready to smite.

I know nothing of Political Economy, or the theories of trade. I have
tried to write truthfully; and if my accounts agree or clash with any
system, the agreement or disagreement is unintentional.

To myself the idea which I have formed of the state of feeling among
too many of the factory-people in Manchester, and which I endeavoured
to represent in this tale (completed above a year ago), has received
some confirmation from the events which have so recently occurred
among a similar class on the Continent.

OCTOBER, 1848.




CHAPTER I.

A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.


   Oh! 'tis hard, 'tis hard to be working
     The whole of the live-long day,
   When all the neighbours about one
     Are off to their jaunts and play.

   There's Richard he carries his baby,
     And Mary takes little Jane,
   And lovingly they'll be wandering
     Through field and briery lane.

   MANCHESTER SONG.


There are some fields near Manchester, well known to the inhabitants
as "Green Heys Fields," through which runs a public footpath to a
little village about two miles distant. In spite of these fields
being flat and low, nay, in spite of the want of wood (the great and
usual recommendation of level tracts of land), there is a charm about
them which strikes even the inhabitant of a mountainous district,
who sees and feels the effect of contrast in these common-place but
thoroughly rural fields, with the busy, bustling manufacturing town
he left but half-an-hour ago. Here and there an old black and white
farm-house, with its rambling outbuildings, speaks of other times and
other occupations than those which now absorb the population of the
neighbourhood. Here in their seasons may be seen the country business
of hay-making, ploughing, &c., which are such pleasant mysteries
for townspeople to watch; and here the artisan, deafened with noise
of tongues and engines, may come to listen awhile to the delicious
sounds of rural life: the lowing of cattle, the milk-maids' call,
the clatter and cackle of poultry in the old farm-yards. You cannot
wonder, then, that these fields are popular places of resort at
every holiday time; and you would not wonder, if you could see, or I
properly describe, the charm of one particular stile, that it should
be, on such occasions, a crowded halting-place. Close by it is a
deep, clear pond, reflecting in its dark green depths the shadowy
trees that bend over it to exclude the sun. The only place where
its banks are shelving is on the side next to a rambling farm-yard,
belonging to one of those old-world, gabled, black and white houses
I named above, overlooking the field through which the public
footpath leads. The porch of this farm-house is covered by a
rose-tree; and the little garden surrounding it is crowded with a
medley of old-fashioned herbs and flowers, planted long ago, when the
garden was the only druggist's shop within reach, and allowed to grow
in scrambling and wild luxuriance--roses, lavender, sage, balm (for
tea), rosemary, pinks and wallflowers, onions and jessamine, in most
republican and indiscriminate order. This farm-house and garden are
within a hundred yards of the stile of which I spoke, leading from
the large pasture field into a smaller one, divided by a hedge of
hawthorn and black-thorn; and near this stile, on the further side,
there runs a tale that primroses may often be found, and occasionally
the blue sweet violet on the grassy hedge bank.

I do not know whether it was on a holiday granted by the masters, or
a holiday seized in right of Nature and her beautiful spring time by
the workmen, but one afternoon (now ten or a dozen years ago) these
fields were much thronged. It was an early May evening--the April
of the poets; for heavy showers had fallen all the morning, and
the round, soft, white clouds which were blown by a west wind over
the dark blue sky, were sometimes varied by one blacker and more
threatening. The softness of the day tempted forth the young green
leaves, which almost visibly fluttered into life; and the willows,
which that morning had had only a brown reflection in the water
below, were now of that tender gray-green which blends so delicately
with the spring harmony of colours.

Groups of merry and somewhat loud-talking girls, whose ages might
range from twelve to twenty, came by with a buoyant step. They were
most of them factory girls, and wore the usual out-of-doors dress of
that particular class of maidens; namely, a shawl, which at mid-day
or in fine weather was allowed to be merely a shawl, but towards
evening, or if the day were chilly, became a sort of Spanish mantilla
or Scotch plaid, and was brought over the head and hung loosely down,
or was pinned under the chin in no unpicturesque fashion.

Their faces were not remarkable for beauty; indeed, they were below
the average, with one or two exceptions; they had dark hair, neatly
and classically arranged, dark eyes, but sallow complexions and
irregular features. The only thing to strike a passer-by was an
acuteness and intelligence of countenance, which has often been
noticed in a manufacturing population.

There were also numbers of boys, or rather young men, rambling among
these fields, ready to bandy jokes with any one, and particularly
ready to enter into conversation with the girls, who, however, held
themselves aloof, not in a shy, but rather in an independent way,
assuming an indifferent manner to the noisy wit or obstreperous
compliments of the lads. Here and there came a sober quiet couple,
either whispering lovers, or husband and wife, as the case might
be; and if the latter, they were seldom unencumbered by an infant,
carried for the most part by the father, while occasionally even
three or four little toddlers had been carried or dragged thus
far, in order that the whole family might enjoy the delicious May
afternoon together.

Sometime in the course of that afternoon, two working men met with
friendly greeting at the stile so often named. One was a thorough
specimen of a Manchester man; born of factory workers, and himself
bred up in youth, and living in manhood, among the mills. He was
below the middle size and slightly made; there was almost a stunted
look about him; and his wan, colourless face gave you the idea, that
in his childhood he had suffered from the scanty living consequent
upon bad times and improvident habits. His features were strongly
marked, though not irregular, and their expression was extreme
earnestness; resolute either for good or evil; a sort of latent,
stern enthusiasm. At the time of which I write, the good predominated
over the bad in the countenance, and he was one from whom a stranger
would have asked a favour with tolerable faith that it would
be granted. He was accompanied by his wife, who might, without
exaggeration, have been called a lovely woman, although now her face
was swollen with crying, and often hidden behind her apron. She
had the fresh beauty of the agricultural districts; and somewhat
of the deficiency of sense in her countenance, which is likewise
characteristic of the rural inhabitants in comparison with the
natives of the manufacturing towns. She was far advanced in
pregnancy, which perhaps occasioned the overpowering and hysterical
nature of her grief. The friend whom they met was more handsome and
less sensible-looking than the man I have just described; he seemed
hearty and hopeful, and although his age was greater, yet there was
far more of youth's buoyancy in his appearance. He was tenderly
carrying a baby in arms, while his wife, a delicate, fragile-looking
woman, limping in her gait, bore another of the same age; little,
feeble twins, inheriting the frail appearance of their mother.

The last-mentioned man was the first to speak, while a sudden look
of sympathy dimmed his gladsome face. "Well, John, how goes it with
you?" and, in a lower voice, he added, "Any news of Esther, yet?"
Meanwhile the wives greeted each other like old friends, the soft and
plaintive voice of the mother of the twins seeming to call forth only
fresh sobs from Mrs. Barton.

"Come, women," said John Barton, "you've both walked far enough. My
Mary expects to have her bed in three weeks; and as for you, Mrs.
Wilson, you know you're but a cranky sort of a body at the best of
times." This was said so kindly, that no offence could be taken. "Sit
you down here; the grass is well nigh dry by this time; and you're
neither of you nesh [1] folk about taking cold. Stay," he added, with
some tenderness, "here's my pocket-handkerchief to spread under
you, to save the gowns women always think so much of; and now, Mrs.
Wilson, give me the baby, I may as well carry him, while you talk and
comfort my wife; poor thing, she takes on sadly about Esther."

   [Footnote 1: "Nesh;" Anglo-Saxon, nesc, tender.]

These arrangements were soon completed: the two women sat down on the
blue cotton handkerchiefs of their husbands, and the latter, each
carrying a baby, set off for a further walk; but as soon as Barton
had turned his back upon his wife, his countenance fell back into an
expression of gloom.

"Then you've heard nothing of Esther, poor lass?" asked Wilson.

"No, nor shan't, as I take it. My mind is, she's gone off with
somebody. My wife frets, and thinks she's drowned herself, but
I tell her, folks don't care to put on their best clothes to drown
themselves; and Mrs. Bradshaw (where she lodged, you know) says the
last time she set eyes on her was last Tuesday, when she came down
stairs, dressed in her Sunday gown, and with a new ribbon in her
bonnet, and gloves on her hands, like the lady she was so fond of
thinking herself."

"She was as pretty a creature as ever the sun shone on."

"Ay, she was a farrantly [2] lass; more's the pity now," added Barton,
with a sigh. "You see them Buckinghamshire people as comes to work
in Manchester, has quite a different look with them to us Manchester
folk. You'll not see among the Manchester wenches such fresh rosy
cheeks, or such black lashes to gray eyes (making them look like
black), as my wife and Esther had. I never seed two such pretty women
for sisters; never. Not but what beauty is a sad snare. Here was
Esther so puffed up, that there was no holding her in. Her spirit was
always up, if I spoke ever so little in the way of advice to her; my
wife spoiled her, it is true, for you see she was so much older than
Esther she was more like a mother to her, doing every thing for her."


   [Footnote 2: "Farrantly," comely, pleasant-looking.]


"I wonder she ever left you," observed his friend.

"That's the worst of factory work, for girls. They can earn so much
when work is plenty, that they can maintain themselves any how. My
Mary shall never work in a factory, that I'm determined on. You see
Esther spent her money in dress, thinking to set off her pretty face;
and got to come home so late at night, that at last I told her my
mind: my missis thinks I spoke crossly, but I meant right, for I
loved Esther, if it was only for Mary's sake. Says I, 'Esther, I see
what you'll end at with your artificials, and your fly-away veils,
and stopping out when honest women are in their beds; you'll be a
street-walker, Esther, and then, don't you go to think I'll have you
darken my door, though my wife is your sister.' So says she, 'Don't
trouble yourself, John. I'll pack up and be off now, for I'll never
stay to hear myself called as you call me.' She flushed up like a
turkey-cock, and I thought fire would come out of her eyes; but when
she saw Mary cry (for Mary can't abide words in a house), she went
and kissed her, and said she was not so bad as I thought her. So we
talked more friendly, for, as I said, I liked the lass well enough,
and her pretty looks, and her cheery ways. But she said (and at the
time I thought there was sense in what she said) we should be much
better friends if she went into lodgings, and only came to see us now
and then."

"Then you still were friendly. Folks said you'd cast her off, and
said you'd never speak to her again."

"Folks always make one a deal worse than one is," said John Barton,
testily. "She came many a time to our house after she left off living
with us. Last Sunday se'nnight--no! it was this very last Sunday, she
came to drink a cup of tea with Mary; and that was the last time we
set eyes on her."

"Was she any ways different in her manner?" asked Wilson.

"Well, I don't know. I have thought several times since, that she was
a bit quieter, and more womanly-like; more gentle, and more blushing,
and not so riotous and noisy. She comes in, toward four o'clock,
when afternoon church was loosing, and she goes and hangs her bonnet
up on the old nail we used to call hers, while she lived with us. I
remember thinking what a pretty lass she was, as she sat on a low
stool by Mary, who was rocking herself, and in rather a poor way.
She laughed and cried by turns, but all so softly and gently, like
a child, that I couldn't find in my heart to scold her, especially
as Mary was fretting already. One thing I do remember I did say, and
pretty sharply too. She took our little Mary by the waist, and--"

"Thou must leave off calling her 'little' Mary, she's growing up into
as fine a lass as one can see on a summer's day; more of her mother's
stock than thine," interrupted Wilson.

"Well, well, I call her 'little,' because her mother's name is Mary.
But, as I was saying, she takes Mary in a coaxing sort of way, and,
'Mary,' says she, 'what should you think if I sent for you some day
and made a lady of you?' So I could not stand such talk as that to my
girl, and I said, 'Thou'd best not put that nonsense i' the girl's
head I can tell thee; I'd rather see her earning her bread by the
sweat of her brow, as the Bible tells her she should do, ay, though
she never got butter to her bread, than be like a do-nothing lady,
worrying shopmen all morning, and screeching at her pianny all
afternoon, and going to bed without having done a good turn to any
one of God's creatures but herself.'"

"Thou never could abide the gentlefolk," said Wilson, half amused at
his friend's vehemence.

"And what good have they ever done me that I should like them?" asked
Barton, the latent fire lighting up his eye: and bursting forth, he
continued, "If I am sick, do they come and nurse me? If my child lies
dying (as poor Tom lay, with his white wan lips quivering, for want
of better food than I could give him), does the rich man bring the
wine or broth that might save his life? If I am out of work for weeks
in the bad times, and winter comes, with black frost, and keen east
wind, and there is no coal for the grate, and no clothes for the bed,
and the thin bones are seen through the ragged clothes, does the rich
man share his plenty with me, as he ought to do, if his religion
wasn't a humbug? When I lie on my death-bed, and Mary (bless her)
stands fretting, as I know she will fret," and here his voice
faltered a little, "will a rich lady come and take her to her own
home if need be, till she can look round, and see what best to do?
No, I tell you, it's the poor, and the poor only, as does such things
for the poor. Don't think to come over me with th' old tale, that the
rich know nothing of the trials of the poor. I say, if they don't
know, they ought to know. We're their slaves as long as we can work;
we pile up their fortunes with the sweat of our brows; and yet we are
to live as separate as if we were in two worlds; ay, as separate as
Dives and Lazarus, with a great gulf betwixt us: but I know who was
best off then," and he wound up his speech with a low chuckle that
had no mirth in it.

"Well, neighbour," said Wilson, "all that may be very true, but what
I want to know now is about Esther--when did you last hear of her?"

"Why, she took leave of us that Sunday night in a very loving way,
kissing both wife Mary, and daughter Mary (if I must not call her
little), and shaking hands with me; but all in a cheerful sort of
manner, so we thought nothing about her kisses and shakes. But on
Wednesday night comes Mrs. Bradshaw's son with Esther's box, and
presently Mrs. Bradshaw follows with the key; and when we began to
talk, we found Esther told her she was coming back to live with us,
and would pay her week's money for not giving notice; and on Tuesday
night she carried off a little bundle (her best clothes were on her
back, as I said before), and told Mrs. Bradshaw not to hurry herself
about the big box, but bring it when she had time. So of course she
thought she should find Esther with us; and when she told her story,
my missis set up such a screech, and fell down in a dead swoon. Mary
ran up with water for her mother, and I thought so much about my
wife, I did not seem to care at all for Esther. But the next day I
asked all the neighbours (both our own and Bradshaw's), and they'd
none of 'em heard or seen nothing of her. I even went to a policeman,
a good enough sort of man, but a fellow I'd never spoke to before
because of his livery, and I asks him if his 'cuteness could find any
thing out for us. So I believe he asks other policemen; and one on
'em had seen a wench, like our Esther, walking very quickly, with a
bundle under her arm, on Tuesday night, toward eight o'clock, and
get into a hackney coach, near Hulme Church, and we don't know th'
number, and can't trace it no further. I'm sorry enough for the girl,
for bad's come over her, one way or another, but I'm sorrier for my
wife. She loved her next to me and Mary, and she's never been the
same body since poor Tom's death. However, let's go back to them;
your old woman may have done her good."

As they walked homewards with a brisker pace, Wilson expressed a wish
that they still were the near neighbours they once had been.

"Still our Alice lives in the cellar under No. 14, in Barber Street,
and if you'd only speak the word she'd be with you in five minutes,
to keep your wife company when she's lonesome. Though I'm Alice's
brother, and perhaps ought not to say it, I will say there's none
more ready to help with heart or hand than she is. Though she may
have done a hard day's wash, there's not a child ill within the
street but Alice goes to offer to sit up, and does sit up too, though
may be she's to be at her work by six next morning."

"She's a poor woman, and can feel for the poor, Wilson," was Barton's
reply; and then he added, "Thank you kindly for your offer, and
mayhap I may trouble her to be a bit with my wife, for while I'm
at work, and Mary's at school, I know she frets above a bit. See,
there's Mary!" and the father's eye brightened, as in the distance,
among a group of girls, he spied his only daughter, a bonny lassie
of thirteen or so, who came bounding along to meet and to greet her
father, in a manner which showed that the stern-looking man had a
tender nature within. The two men had crossed the last stile while
Mary loitered behind to gather some buds of the coming hawthorn, when
an over-grown lad came past her, and snatched a kiss, exclaiming,
"For old acquaintance sake, Mary."

"Take that for old acquaintance sake, then," said the girl, blushing
rosy red, more with anger than shame, as she slapped his face. The
tones of her voice called back her father and his friend, and the
aggressor proved to be the eldest son of the latter, the senior by
eighteen years of his little brothers.

"Here, children, instead o' kissing and quarrelling, do ye each take
a baby, for if Wilson's arms be like mine they are heartily tired."

Mary sprang forward to take her father's charge, with a girl's
fondness for infants, and with some little foresight of the event
soon to happen at home; while young Wilson seemed to lose his rough,
cubbish nature as he crowed and cooed to his little brother.

"Twins is a great trial to a poor man, bless 'em," said the
half-proud, half-weary father, as he bestowed a smacking kiss on the
babe ere he parted with it.




CHAPTER II.

A MANCHESTER TEA-PARTY.


   Polly, put the kettle on,
     And let's have tea!
   Polly, put the kettle on,
     And we'll all have tea.


"Here we are, wife; didst thou think thou'd lost us?" quoth
hearty-voiced Wilson, as the two women rose and shook themselves
in preparation for their homeward walk. Mrs. Barton was evidently
soothed, if not cheered, by the unburdening of her fears and thoughts
to her friend; and her approving look went far to second her
husband's invitation that the whole party should adjourn from Green
Heys Fields to tea, at the Bartons' house. The only faint opposition
was raised by Mrs. Wilson, on account of the lateness of the hour at
which they would probably return, which she feared on her babies'
account.

"Now, hold your tongue, missis, will you," said her husband,
good-temperedly. "Don't you know them brats never goes to sleep till
long past ten? and haven't you a shawl, under which you can tuck one
lad's head, as safe as a bird's under its wing? And as for t'other
one, I'll put it in my pocket rather than not stay, now we are this
far away from Ancoats."

"Or I can lend you another shawl," suggested Mrs. Barton.

"Ay, any thing rather than not stay."

The matter being decided, the party proceeded home, through many
half-finished streets, all so like one another that you might have
easily been bewildered and lost your way. Not a step, however, did
our friends lose; down this entry, cutting off that corner, until
they turned out of one of these innumerable streets into a little
paved court, having the backs of houses at the end opposite to
the opening, and a gutter running through the middle to carry off
household slops, washing suds, &c. The women who lived in the court
were busy taking in strings of caps, frocks, and various articles of
linen, which hung from side to side, dangling so low, that if our
friends had been a few minutes sooner, they would have had to stoop
very much, or else the half-wet clothes would have flapped in their
faces; but although the evening seemed yet early when they were in
the open fields--among the pent-up houses, night, with its mists, and
its darkness, had already begun to fall.

Many greetings were given and exchanged between the Wilsons and these
women, for not long ago they had also dwelt in this court.

Two rude lads, standing at a disorderly looking house-door,
exclaimed, as Mary Barton (the daughter) passed, "Eh, look! Polly
Barton's gotten a sweetheart."

Of course this referred to young Wilson, who stole a look to see how
Mary took the idea. He saw her assume the air of a young fury, and to
his next speech she answered not a word.

Mrs. Barton produced the key of the door from her pocket; and on
entering the house-place it seemed as if they were in total darkness,
except one bright spot, which might be a cat's eye, or might be, what
it was, a red-hot fire, smouldering under a large piece of coal,
which John Barton immediately applied himself to break up, and the
effect instantly produced was warm and glowing light in every corner
of the room. To add to this (although the coarse yellow glare seemed
lost in the ruddy glow from the fire), Mrs. Barton lighted a dip by
sticking it in the fire, and having placed it satisfactorily in a
tin candlestick, began to look further about her, on hospitable
thoughts intent. The room was tolerably large, and possessed many
conveniences. On the right of the door, as you entered, was a longish
window, with a broad ledge. On each side of this, hung blue-and-white
check curtains, which were now drawn, to shut in the friends met to
enjoy themselves. Two geraniums, unpruned and leafy, which stood
on the sill, formed a further defence from out-door pryers. In
the corner between the window and the fire-side was a cupboard,
apparently full of plates and dishes, cups and saucers, and some
more nondescript articles, for which one would have fancied their
possessors could find no use--such as triangular pieces of glass to
save carving knives and forks from dirtying table-cloths. However,
it was evident Mrs. Barton was proud of her crockery and glass, for
she left her cupboard door open, with a glance round of satisfaction
and pleasure. On the opposite side to the door and window was the
staircase, and two doors; one of which (the nearest to the fire)
led into a sort of little back kitchen, where dirty work, such
as washing up dishes, might be done, and whose shelves served as
larder, and pantry, and storeroom, and all. The other door, which
was considerably lower, opened into the coal-hole--the slanting
closet under the stairs; from which, to the fire-place, there was a
gay-coloured piece of oil-cloth laid. The place seemed almost crammed
with furniture (sure sign of good times among the mills). Beneath the
window was a dresser with three deep drawers. Opposite the fire-place
was a table, which I should call a Pembroke, only that it was made
of deal, and I cannot tell how far such a name may be applied to
such humble material. On it, resting against the wall, was a bright
green japanned tea-tray, having a couple of scarlet lovers embracing
in the middle. The fire-light danced merrily on this, and really
(setting all taste but that of a child's aside) it gave a richness
of colouring to that side of the room. It was in some measure propped
up by a crimson tea-caddy, also of japan ware. A round table on one
branching leg really for use, stood in the corresponding corner to
the cupboard; and, if you can picture all this with a washy, but
clean stencilled pattern on the walls, you can form some idea of John
Barton's home.

The tray was soon hoisted down, and before the merry chatter of
cups and saucers began, the women disburdened themselves of their
out-of-door things, and sent Mary up stairs with them. Then came a
long whispering, and chinking of money, to which Mr. and Mrs. Wilson
were too polite to attend; knowing, as they did full well, that it
all related to the preparations for hospitality; hospitality that,
in their turn, they should have such pleasure in offering. So they
tried to be busily occupied with the children, and not to hear Mrs.
Barton's directions to Mary.

"Run, Mary dear, just round the corner, and get some fresh eggs at
Tipping's (you may get one a-piece, that will be five-pence), and see
if he has any nice ham cut, that he would let us have a pound of."

"Say two pounds, missis, and don't be stingy," chimed in the husband.

"Well, a pound and a half, Mary. And get it Cumberland ham, for
Wilson comes from there-away, and it will have a sort of relish of
home with it he'll like,--and Mary" (seeing the lassie fain to be
off), "you must get a pennyworth of milk and a loaf of bread--mind
you get it fresh and new--and, and--that's all, Mary."

"No, it's not all," said her husband. "Thou must get sixpennyworth of
rum, to warm the tea; thou'll get it at the 'Grapes.' And thou just
go to Alice Wilson; he says she lives just right round the corner,
under 14, Barber Street" (this was addressed to his wife), "and tell
her to come and take her tea with us; she'll like to see her brother,
I'll be bound, let alone Jane and the twins."

"If she comes she must bring a tea-cup and saucer, for we have but
half-a-dozen, and here's six of us," said Mrs. Barton.

"Pooh! pooh! Jem and Mary can drink out of one, surely."

But Mary secretly determined to take care that Alice brought her
tea-cup and saucer, if the alternative was to be her sharing any
thing with Jem.

Alice Wilson had but just come in. She had been out all day in
the fields, gathering wild herbs for drinks and medicine, for in
addition to her invaluable qualities as a sick nurse and her worldly
occupation as a washerwoman, she added a considerable knowledge of
hedge and field simples; and on fine days, when no more profitable
occupation offered itself, she used to ramble off into the lanes and
meadows as far as her legs could carry her. This evening she had
returned loaded with nettles, and her first object was to light a
candle and see to hang them up in bunches in every available place in
her cellar room. It was the perfection of cleanliness: in one corner
stood the modest-looking bed, with a check curtain at the head, the
whitewashed wall filling up the place where the corresponding one
should have been. The floor was bricked, and scrupulously clean,
although so damp that it seemed as if the last washing would never
dry up. As the cellar window looked into an area in the street,
down which boys might throw stones, it was protected by an outside
shelter, and was oddly festooned with all manner of hedge-row, ditch,
and field plants, which we are accustomed to call valueless, but
which have a powerful effect either for good or for evil, and are
consequently much used among the poor. The room was strewed, hung,
and darkened with these bunches, which emitted no very fragrant odour
in their process of drying. In one corner was a sort of broad hanging
shelf, made of old planks, where some old hoards of Alice's were
kept. Her little bit of crockery ware was ranged on the mantelpiece,
where also stood her candlestick and box of matches. A small cupboard
contained at the bottom coals, and at the top her bread and basin of
oatmeal, her frying pan, tea-pot, and a small tin saucepan, which
served as a kettle, as well as for cooking the delicate little messes
of broth which Alice sometimes was able to manufacture for a sick
neighbour.

After her walk she felt chilly and weary, and was busy trying to
light her fire with the damp coals, and half green sticks, when Mary
knocked.

"Come in," said Alice, remembering, however, that she had barred the
door for the night, and hastening to make it possible for any one to
come in.

"Is that you, Mary Barton?" exclaimed she, as the light from her
candle streamed on the girl's face. "How you are grown since I used
to see you at my brother's! Come in, lass, come in."

"Please," said Mary, almost breathless, "mother says you're to come
to tea, and bring your cup and saucer, for George and Jane Wilson is
with us, and the twins, and Jem. And you're to make haste, please."

"I'm sure it's very neighbourly and kind in your mother, and I'll
come, with many thanks. Stay, Mary, has your mother got any nettles
for spring drink? If she hasn't I'll take her some."

"No, I don't think she has."

Mary ran off like a hare to fulfil what, to a girl of thirteen,
fond of power, was the more interesting part of her errand--the
money-spending part. And well and ably did she perform her business,
returning home with a little bottle of rum, and the eggs in one
hand, while her other was filled with some excellent red-and-white
smoke-flavoured Cumberland ham, wrapped up in paper.

She was at home, and frying ham, before Alice had chosen her nettles,
put out her candle, locked her door, and walked in a very foot-sore
manner as far as John Barton's. What an aspect of comfort did his
houseplace present, after her humble cellar. She did not think of
comparing; but for all that she felt the delicious glow of the fire,
the bright light that revelled in every corner of the room, the
savoury smells, the comfortable sounds of a boiling kettle, and the
hissing, frizzling ham. With a little old-fashioned curtsey she shut
the door, and replied with a loving heart to the boisterous and
surprised greeting of her brother.

And now all preparations being made, the party sat down; Mrs. Wilson
in the post of honour, the rocking chair on the right hand side
of the fire, nursing her baby, while its father, in an opposite
arm-chair, tried vainly to quieten the other with bread soaked in
milk.

Mrs. Barton knew manners too well to do any thing but sit at the
tea-table and make tea, though in her heart she longed to be able
to superintend the frying of the ham, and cast many an anxious
look at Mary as she broke the eggs and turned the ham, with a very
comfortable portion of confidence in her own culinary powers. Jem
stood awkwardly leaning against the dresser, replying rather gruffly
to his aunt's speeches, which gave him, he thought, the air of being
a little boy; whereas he considered himself as a young man, and not
so very young neither, as in two months he would be eighteen. Barton
vibrated between the fire and the tea-table, his only drawback
being a fancy that every now and then his wife's face flushed and
contracted as if in pain.

At length the business actually began. Knives and forks, cups and
saucers made a noise, but human voices were still, for human beings
were hungry, and had no time to speak. Alice first broke silence;
holding her tea-cup with the manner of one proposing a toast, she
said, "Here's to absent friends. Friends may meet, but mountains
never."

It was an unlucky toast or sentiment, as she instantly felt. Every
one thought of Esther, the absent Esther; and Mrs. Barton put down
her food, and could not hide the fast dropping tears. Alice could
have bitten her tongue out.

It was a wet blanket to the evening; for though all had been said
and suggested in the fields that could be said or suggested, every
one had a wish to say something in the way of comfort to poor Mrs.
Barton, and a dislike to talk about any thing else while her tears
fell fast and scalding. So George Wilson, his wife and children, set
off early home, not before (in spite of _mal-à-propos_ speeches) they
had expressed a wish that such meetings might often take place, and
not before John Barton had given his hearty consent; and declared
that as soon as ever his wife was well again they would have just
such another evening.

"I will take care not to come and spoil it," thought poor Alice; and
going up to Mrs. Barton she took her hand almost humbly, and said,
"You don't know how sorry I am I said it."

To her surprise, a surprise that brought tears of joy into her
eyes, Mary Barton put her arms round her neck, and kissed the
self-reproaching Alice. "You didn't mean any harm, and it was me as
was so foolish; only this work about Esther, and not knowing where
she is, lies so heavy on my heart. Good night, and never think no
more about it. God bless you, Alice."

Many and many a time, as Alice reviewed that evening in her after
life, did she bless Mary Barton for these kind and thoughtful words.
But just then all she could say was, "Good night, Mary, and may God
bless _you_."




CHAPTER III.

JOHN BARTON'S GREAT TROUBLE.


   But when the morn came dim and sad,
     And chill with early showers,
   Her quiet eyelids closed--she had
     Another morn than ours!

   HOOD.


In the middle of that same night a neighbour of the Bartons was
roused from her sound, well-earned sleep, by a knocking, which had at
first made part of her dream; but starting up, as soon as she became
convinced of its reality, she opened the window, and asked who was
there?

"Me, John Barton," answered he, in a voice tremulous with agitation.
"My missis is in labour, and, for the love of God, step in while I
run for th' doctor, for she's fearful bad."

While the woman hastily dressed herself, leaving the window still
open, she heard cries of agony, which resounded in the little court
in the stillness of the night. In less than five minutes she was
standing by Mrs. Barton's bed-side, relieving the terrified Mary, who
went about, where she was told, like an automaton; her eyes tearless,
her face calm, though deadly pale, and uttering no sound, except when
her teeth chattered for very nervousness.

The cries grew worse.

The doctor was very long in hearing the repeated rings at his
night-bell, and still longer in understanding who it was that made
this sudden call upon his services; and then he begged Barton just
to wait while he dressed himself, in order that no time might be
lost in finding the court and house. Barton absolutely stamped with
impatience, outside the doctor's door, before he came down; and
walked so fast homewards, that the medical man several times asked
him to go slower.

"Is she so very bad?" asked he.

"Worse, much worser than ever I saw her before," replied John.

No! she was not--she was at peace. The cries were still for ever.
John had no time for listening. He opened the latched door, stayed
not to light a candle for the mere ceremony of showing his companion
up the stairs, so well known to himself; but, in two minutes was
in the room, where lay the dead wife, whom he had loved with all
the power of his strong heart. The doctor stumbled up stairs by the
fire-light, and met the awe-struck look of the neighbour, which at
once told him the state of things. The room was still, as he, with
habitual tip-toe step, approached the poor frail body, whom nothing
now could more disturb. Her daughter knelt by the bed-side, her face
buried in the clothes, which were almost crammed into her mouth, to
keep down the choking sobs. The husband stood like one stupified. The
doctor questioned the neighbour in whispers, and then approaching
Barton, said, "You must go down stairs. This is a great shock, but
bear it like a man. Go down."

He went mechanically and sat down on the first chair. He had no hope.
The look of death was too clear upon her face. Still, when he heard
one or two unusual noises, the thought burst on him that it might
only be a trance, a fit, a--he did not well know what,--but not
death! Oh, not death! And he was starting up to go up stairs again,
when the doctor's heavy cautious creaking footstep was heard on the
stairs. Then he knew what it really was in the chamber above.

"Nothing could have saved her--there has been some shock to the
system--" and so he went on; but, to unheeding ears, which yet
retained his words to ponder on; words not for immediate use in
conveying sense, but to be laid by, in the store-house of memory, for
a more convenient season. The doctor seeing the state of the case,
grieved for the man; and, very sleepy, thought it best to go, and
accordingly wished him good-night--but there was no answer, so he let
himself out; and Barton sat on, like a stock or a stone, so rigid,
so still. He heard the sounds above too, and knew what they meant.
He heard the stiff, unseasoned drawer, in which his wife kept her
clothes, pulled open. He saw the neighbour come down, and blunder
about in search of soap and water. He knew well what she wanted, and
_why_ she wanted them, but he did not speak, nor offer to help. At
last she went, with some kindly-meant words (a text of comfort, which
fell upon a deafened ear), and something about "Mary," but which
Mary, in his bewildered state, he could not tell.

He tried to realise it, to think it possible. And then his mind
wandered off to other days, to far different times. He thought of
their courtship; of his first seeing her, an awkward, beautiful
rustic, far too shiftless for the delicate factory work to which she
was apprenticed; of his first gift to her, a bead necklace, which had
long ago been put by, in one of the deep drawers of the dresser, to
be kept for Mary. He wondered if it was there yet, and with a strange
curiosity he got up to feel for it; for the fire by this time was
well-nigh out, and candle he had none. His groping hand fell on
the piled-up tea things, which at his desire she had left unwashed
till morning--they were all so tired. He was reminded of one of the
daily little actions, which acquire such power when they have been
performed for the last time, by one we love. He began to think over
his wife's daily round of duties; and something in the remembrance
that these would never more be done by her, touched the source of
tears, and he cried aloud. Poor Mary, meanwhile, had mechanically
helped the neighbour in all the last attentions to the dead; and when
she was kissed, and spoken to soothingly, tears stole quietly down
her cheeks: but she reserved the luxury of a full burst of grief till
she should be alone. She shut the chamber-door softly, after the
neighbour had gone, and then shook the bed by which she knelt, with
her agony of sorrow. She repeated, over and over again, the same
words; the same vain, unanswered address to her who was no more. "Oh,
mother! mother, are you really dead! Oh, mother, mother!"

At last she stopped, because it flashed across her mind that her
violence of grief might disturb her father. All was still below. She
looked on the face so changed, and yet so strangely like. She bent
down to kiss it. The cold, unyielding flesh struck a shudder to her
heart, and, hastily obeying her impulse, she grasped the candle, and
opened the door. Then she heard the sobs of her father's grief; and
quickly, quietly, stealing down the steps, she knelt by him, and
kissed his hand. He took no notice at first, for his burst of grief
would not be controlled. But when her shriller sobs, her terrified
cries (which she could not repress), rose upon his ear, he checked
himself.

"Child, we must be all to one another, now _she_ is gone," whispered
he.

"Oh, father, what can I do for you? Do tell me! I'll do any thing."

"I know thou wilt. Thou must not fret thyself ill, that's the first
thing I ask. Thou must leave me, and go to bed now, like a good girl
as thou art."

"Leave you, father! oh, don't say so."

"Ay, but thou must! thou must go to bed, and try and sleep; thou'lt
have enough to do and to bear, poor wench, to-morrow."

Mary got up, kissed her father, and sadly went up stairs to the
little closet, where she slept. She thought it was of no use
undressing, for that she could never, never sleep, so threw herself
on her bed in her clothes, and before ten minutes had passed away,
the passionate grief of youth had subsided into sleep.

Barton had been roused by his daughter's entrance, both from his
stupor and from his uncontrollable sorrow. He could think on what was
to be done, could plan for the funeral, could calculate the necessity
of soon returning to his work, as the extravagance of the past night
would leave them short of money, if he long remained away from the
mill. He was in a club, so that money was provided for the burial.
These things settled in his own mind, he recalled the doctor's words,
and bitterly thought of the shock his poor wife had so recently had,
in the mysterious disappearance of her cherished sister. His feelings
towards Esther almost amounted to curses. It was she who had brought
on all this sorrow. Her giddiness, her lightness of conduct, had
wrought this woe. His previous thoughts about her had been tinged
with wonder and pity, but now he hardened his heart against her for
ever.

One of the good influences over John Barton's life had departed that
night. One of the ties which bound him down to the gentle humanities
of earth was loosened, and henceforward the neighbours all remarked
he was a changed man. His gloom and his sternness became habitual
instead of occasional. He was more obstinate. But never to Mary.
Between the father and the daughter there existed in full force that
mysterious bond which unites those who have been loved by one who
is now dead and gone. While he was harsh and silent to others, he
humoured Mary with tender love; she had more of her own way than
is common in any rank with girls of her age. Part of this was the
necessity of the case; for, of course, all the money went through
her hands, and the household arrangements were guided by her will
and pleasure. But part was her father's indulgence, for he left her,
with full trust in her unusual sense and spirit, to choose her own
associates, and her own times for seeing them.

With all this, Mary had not her father's confidence in the matters
which now began to occupy him, heart and soul; she was aware that
he had joined clubs, and become an active member of a trades' union,
but it was hardly likely that a girl of Mary's age (even when two or
three years had elapsed since her mother's death) should care much
for the differences between the employers and the employed,--an
eternal subject for agitation in the manufacturing districts, which,
however it may be lulled for a time, is sure to break forth again
with fresh violence at any depression of trade, showing that in its
apparent quiet, the ashes had still smouldered in the breasts of a
few.

Among these few was John Barton. At all times it is a bewildering
thing to the poor weaver to see his employer removing from house to
house, each one grander than the last, till he ends in building one
more magnificent than all, or withdraws his money from the concern,
or sells his mill to buy an estate in the country, while all the time
the weaver, who thinks he and his fellows are the real makers of this
wealth, is struggling on for bread for their children, through the
vicissitudes of lowered wages, short hours, fewer hands employed,
&c. And when he knows trade is bad, and could understand (at least
partially) that there are not buyers enough in the market to purchase
the goods already made, and consequently that there is no demand for
more; when he would bear and endure much without complaining, could
he also see that his employers were bearing their share; he is, I
say, bewildered and (to use his own word) "aggravated" to see that
all goes on just as usual with the mill-owners. Large houses are
still occupied, while spinners' and weavers' cottages stand empty,
because the families that once occupied them are obliged to live in
rooms or cellars. Carriages still roll along the streets, concerts
are still crowded by subscribers, the shops for expensive luxuries
still find daily customers, while the workman loiters away his
unemployed time in watching these things, and thinking of the pale,
uncomplaining wife at home, and the wailing children asking in vain
for enough of food, of the sinking health, of the dying life of those
near and dear to him. The contrast is too great. Why should he alone
suffer from bad times?

I know that this is not really the case; and I know what is the truth
in such matters: but what I wish to impress is what the workman feels
and thinks. True, that with child-like improvidence, good times will
often dissipate his grumbling, and make him forget all prudence and
foresight.

But there are earnest men among these people, men who have endured
wrongs without complaining, but without ever forgetting or forgiving
those whom (they believe) have caused all this woe.

Among these was John Barton. His parents had suffered, his mother
had died from absolute want of the necessaries of life. He himself
was a good, steady workman, and, as such, pretty certain of steady
employment. But he spent all he got with the confidence (you may also
call it improvidence) of one who was willing, and believed himself
able, to supply all his wants by his own exertions. And when his
master suddenly failed, and all hands in that mill were turned back,
one Tuesday morning, with the news that Mr. Hunter had stopped,
Barton had only a few shillings to rely on; but he had good heart of
being employed at some other mill, and accordingly, before returning
home, he spent some hours in going from factory to factory, asking
for work. But at every mill was some sign of depression of trade;
some were working short hours, some were turning off hands, and for
weeks Barton was out of work, living on credit. It was during this
time his little son, the apple of his eye, the cynosure of all his
strong power of love, fell ill of the scarlet fever. They dragged him
through the crisis, but his life hung on a gossamer thread. Every
thing, the doctor said, depended on good nourishment, on generous
living, to keep up the little fellow's strength, in the prostration
in which the fever had left him. Mocking words! when the commonest
food in the house would not furnish one little meal. Barton tried
credit; but it was worn out at the little provision shops, which were
now suffering in their turn. He thought it would be no sin to steal,
and would have stolen; but he could not get the opportunity in the
few days the child lingered. Hungry himself, almost to an animal
pitch of ravenousness, but with the bodily pain swallowed up in
anxiety for his little sinking lad, he stood at one of the shop
windows where all edible luxuries are displayed; haunches of venison,
Stilton cheeses, moulds of jelly--all appetising sights to the common
passer by. And out of this shop came Mrs. Hunter! She crossed to her
carriage, followed by the shopman loaded with purchases for a party.
The door was quickly slammed to, and she drove away; and Barton
returned home with a bitter spirit of wrath in his heart, to see his
only boy a corpse!

You can fancy, now, the hoards of vengeance in his heart against the
employers. For there are never wanting those who, either in speech
or in print, find it their interest to cherish such feelings in the
working classes; who know how and when to rouse the dangerous power
at their command; and who use their knowledge with unrelenting
purpose to either party.

So while Mary took her own way, growing more spirited every day, and
growing in her beauty too, her father was chairman at many a trades'
union meeting; a friend of delegates, and ambitious of being a
delegate himself; a Chartist, and ready to do any thing for his
order.

But now times were good; and all these feelings were theoretical, not
practical. His most practical thought was getting Mary apprenticed to
a dressmaker; for he had never left off disliking a factory life for
a girl, on more accounts than one.

Mary must do something. The factories being, as I said, out of the
question, there were two things open--going out to service, and
the dressmaking business; and against the first of these, Mary set
herself with all the force of her strong will. What that will might
have been able to achieve had her father been against her, I cannot
tell; but he disliked the idea of parting with her, who was the light
of his hearth, the voice of his otherwise silent home. Besides, with
his ideas and feelings towards the higher classes, he considered
domestic servitude as a species of slavery; a pampering of artificial
wants on the one side, a giving-up of every right of leisure by day
and quiet rest by night on the other. How far his strong exaggerated
feelings had any foundation in truth, it is for you to judge. I am
afraid that Mary's determination not to go to service arose from far
less sensible thoughts on the subject than her father's. Three years
of independence of action (since her mother's death such a time
had now elapsed) had little inclined her to submit to rules as to
hours and associates, to regulate her dress by a mistress's ideas
of propriety, to lose the dear feminine privileges of gossiping
with a merry neighbour, and working night and day to help one who
was sorrowful. Besides all this, the sayings of her absent, her
mysterious aunt, Esther, had an unacknowledged influence over Mary.
She knew she was very pretty; the factory people as they poured from
the mills, and in their freedom told the truth (whatever it might be)
to every passer-by, had early let Mary into the secret of her beauty.
If their remarks had fallen on an unheeding ear, there were always
young men enough, in a different rank from her own, who were willing
to compliment the pretty weaver's daughter as they met her in the
streets. Besides, trust a girl of sixteen for knowing well if she is
pretty; concerning her plainness she may be ignorant. So with this
consciousness she had early determined that her beauty should make
her a lady; the rank she coveted the more for her father's abuse; the
rank to which she firmly believed her lost aunt Esther had arrived.
Now, while a servant must often drudge and be dirty, must be known as
a servant by all who visited at her master's house, a dressmaker's
apprentice must (or so Mary thought) be always dressed with a certain
regard to appearance; must never soil her hands, and need never
redden or dirty her face with hard labour. Before my telling you so
truly what folly Mary felt or thought, injures her without redemption
in your opinion, think what are the silly fancies of sixteen years of
age in every class, and under all circumstances. The end of all the
thoughts of father and daughter was, as I said before, Mary was to be
a dressmaker; and her ambition prompted her unwilling father to apply
at all the first establishments, to know on what terms of painstaking
and zeal his daughter might be admitted into ever so humble a
workwoman's situation. But high premiums were asked at all; poor man!
he might have known that without giving up a day's work to ascertain
the fact. He would have been indignant, indeed, had he known that if
Mary had accompanied him, the case might have been rather different,
as her beauty would have made her desirable as a show-woman. Then he
tried second-rate places; at all the payment of a sum of money was
necessary, and money he had none. Disheartened and angry he went home
at night, declaring it was time lost; that dressmaking was at all
events a toilsome business, and not worth learning. Mary saw that the
grapes were sour, and the next day set out herself, as her father
could not afford to lose another day's work; and before night (as
yesterday's experience had considerably lowered her ideas) she had
engaged herself as apprentice (so called, though there were no deeds
or indentures to the bond) to a certain Miss Simmonds, milliner and
dressmaker, in a respectable little street leading off Ardwick Green,
where her business was duly announced in gold letters on a black
ground, enclosed in a bird's-eye maple frame, and stuck in the front
parlour window; where the workwomen were called "her young ladies;"
and where Mary was to work for two years without any remuneration,
on consideration of being taught the business; and where afterwards
she was to dine and have tea, with a small quarterly salary (paid
quarterly, because so much more genteel than by the week), a _very_
small one, divisible into a minute weekly pittance. In summer she was
to be there by six, bringing her day's meals during the first two
years; in winter she was not to come till after breakfast. Her time
for returning home at night must always depend upon the quantity of
work Miss Simmonds had to do.

And Mary was satisfied; and seeing this, her father was contented
too, although his words were grumbling and morose; but Mary knew his
ways, and coaxed and planned for the future so cheerily, that both
went to bed with easy if not happy hearts.




CHAPTER IV.

OLD ALICE'S HISTORY.


   To envy nought beneath the ample sky;
   To mourn no evil deed, no hour mis-spent;
   And, like a living violet, silently
   Return in sweets to Heaven what goodness lent,
   Then bend beneath the chastening shower content.

   ELLIOTT.


Another year passed on. The waves of time seemed long since to have
swept away all trace of poor Mary Barton. But her husband still
thought of her, although with a calm and quiet grief, in the silent
watches of the night: and Mary would start from her hard-earned
sleep, and think in her half-dreamy, half-awakened state, she saw
her mother stand by her bed-side, as she used to do "in the days
of long-ago;" with a shaded candle and an expression of ineffable
tenderness, while she looked on her sleeping child. But Mary rubbed
her eyes and sank back on her pillow, awake, and knowing it was a
dream; and still, in all her troubles and perplexities, her heart
called on her mother for aid, and she thought, "If mother had but
lived, she would have helped me." Forgetting that the woman's sorrows
are far more difficult to mitigate than a child's, even by the mighty
power of a mother's love; and unconscious of the fact, that she was
far superior in sense and spirit to the mother she mourned. Aunt
Esther was still mysteriously absent, and people had grown weary of
wondering and began to forget. Barton still attended his club, and
was an active member of a trades' union; indeed, more frequently
than ever, since the time of Mary's return in the evening was so
uncertain; and, as she occasionally, in very busy times, remained
all night. His chiefest friend was still George Wilson, although he
had no great sympathy on the questions that agitated Barton's mind.
Still their hearts were bound by old ties to one another, and the
remembrance of former times gave an unspoken charm to their meetings.
Our old friend, the cub-like lad, Jem Wilson, had shot up into the
powerful, well-made young man, with a sensible face enough; nay, a
face that might have been handsome, had it not been here and there
marked by the small-pox. He worked with one of the great firms of
engineers, who send from out their towns of workshops engines and
machinery to the dominions of the Czar and the Sultan. His father and
mother were never weary of praising Jem, at all which commendation
pretty Mary Barton would toss her head, seeing clearly enough that
they wished her to understand what a good husband he would make, and
to favour his love, about which he never dared to speak, whatever
eyes and looks revealed.

One day, in the early winter time, when people were provided with
warm substantial gowns, not likely soon to wear out, and when,
accordingly, business was rather slack at Miss Simmonds', Mary
met Alice Wilson, coming home from her half-day's work at some
tradesman's house. Mary and Alice had always liked each other;
indeed, Alice looked with particular interest on the motherless girl,
the daughter of her whose forgiving kiss had so comforted her in many
sleepless hours. So there was a warm greeting between the tidy old
woman and the blooming young work-girl; and then Alice ventured to
ask if she would come in and take her tea with her that very evening.

"You'll think it dull enough to come just to sit with an old woman
like me, but there's a tidy young lass as lives in the floor above,
who does plain work, and now and then a bit in your own line, Mary;
she's grand-daughter to old Job Legh, a spinner, and a good girl she
is. Do come, Mary! I've a terrible wish to make you known to each
other. She's a genteel-looking lass, too."

At the beginning of this speech Mary had feared the intended
visitor was to be no other than Alice's nephew; but Alice was too
delicate-minded to plan a meeting, even for her dear Jem, when one
would have been an unwilling party; and Mary, relieved from her
apprehension by the conclusion, gladly agreed to come. How busy Alice
felt! it was not often she had any one to tea; and now her sense of
the duties of a hostess were almost too much for her. She made haste
home, and lighted the unwilling fire, borrowing a pair of bellows to
make it burn the faster. For herself she was always patient; she let
the coals take their time. Then she put on her pattens, and went to
fill her kettle at the pump in the next court, and on the way she
borrowed a cup; of odd saucers she had plenty, serving as plates
when occasion required. Half an ounce of tea and a quarter of a
pound of butter went far to absorb her morning's wages; but this
was an unusual occasion. In general, she used herb-tea for herself,
when at home, unless some thoughtful mistress made her a present of
tea-leaves from her more abundant household. The two chairs drawn out
for visitors, and duly swept and dusted; an old board arranged with
some skill upon two old candle-boxes set on end (rather ricketty
to be sure, but she knew the seat of old, and when to sit lightly;
indeed the whole affair was more for apparent dignity of position
than for any real ease); a little, very little round table put
just before the fire, which by this time was blazing merrily; her
unlackered, ancient, third-hand tea-tray arranged with a black
tea-pot, two cups with a red and white pattern, and one with the
old friendly willow pattern, and saucers, not to match (on one
of the extra supply, the lump of butter flourished away); all
these preparations complete, Alice began to look about her with
satisfaction, and a sort of wonder what more could be done to add to
the comfort of the evening. She took one of the chairs away from its
appropriate place by the table, and putting it close to the broad
large hanging shelf I told you about when I first described her
cellar-dwelling, and mounting on it, she pulled towards her an old
deal box, and took thence a quantity of the oat bread of the north,
the clap-bread of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and descending
carefully with the thin cakes threatening to break to pieces in her
hand, she placed them on the bare table, with the belief that her
visitors would have an unusual treat in eating the bread of her
childhood. She brought out a good piece of a four-pound loaf of
common household bread as well, and then sat down to rest, really
to rest, and not to pretend, on one of the rush-bottomed chairs.
The candle was ready to be lighted, the kettle boiled, the tea was
awaiting its doom in its paper parcel; all was ready.

A knock at the door! It was Margaret, the young workwoman who lived
in the rooms above, who having heard the bustle, and the subsequent
quiet, began to think it was time to pay her visit below. She was a
sallow, unhealthy, sweet-looking young woman, with a careworn look;
her dress was humble and very simple, consisting of some kind of
dark stuff gown, her neck being covered by a drab shawl or large
handkerchief, pinned down behind and at the sides in front. The old
woman gave her a hearty greeting, and made her sit down on the chair
she had just left, while she balanced herself on the board seat, in
order that Margaret might think it was quite her free and independent
choice to sit there.

"I cannot think what keeps Mary Barton. She's quite grand with her
late hours," said Alice, as Mary still delayed.

The truth was, Mary was dressing herself; yes, to come to poor old
Alice's--she thought it worth while to consider what gown she should
put on. It was not for Alice, however, you may be pretty sure; no,
they knew each other too well. But Mary liked making an impression,
and in this it must be owned she was pretty often gratified--and
there was this strange girl to consider just now. So she put on her
pretty new blue merino, made tight to her throat, her little linen
collar and linen cuffs, and sallied forth to impress poor gentle
Margaret. She certainly succeeded. Alice, who never thought much
about beauty, had never told Margaret how pretty Mary was; and, as
she came in half-blushing at her own self-consciousness, Margaret
could hardly take her eyes off her, and Mary put down her long black
lashes with a sort of dislike of the very observation she had taken
such pains to secure. Can you fancy the bustle of Alice to make the
tea, to pour it out, and sweeten it to their liking, to help and help
again to clap-bread and bread-and-butter? Can you fancy the delight
with which she watched her piled-up clap-bread disappear before the
hungry girls, and listened to the praises of her home-remembered
dainty?

"My mother used to send me some clap-bread by any north-country
person--bless her! She knew how good such things taste when far away
from home. Not but what every one likes it. When I was in service my
fellow-servants were always glad to share with me. Eh, it's a long
time ago, yon."

"Do tell us about it, Alice," said Margaret.

"Why, lass, there's nothing to tell. There was more mouths at home
than could be fed. Tom, that's Will's father (you don't know Will,
but he's a sailor to foreign parts), had come to Manchester, and sent
word what terrible lots of work was to be had, both for lads and
lasses. So father sent George first (you know George, well enough,
Mary), and then work was scarce out toward Burton, where we lived,
and father said I maun try and get a place. And George wrote as how
wages were far higher in Manchester than Milnthorpe or Lancaster;
and, lasses, I was young and thoughtless, and thought it was a fine
thing to go so far from home. So, one day, th' butcher he brings us a
letter fra George, to say he'd heard on a place--and I was all agog
to go, and father was pleased, like; but mother said little, and that
little was very quiet. I've often thought she was a bit hurt to see
me so ready to go--God forgive me! But she packed up my clothes, and
some o' the better end of her own as would fit me, in yon little
paper box up there--it's good for nought now, but I would liefer live
without fire than break it up to be burnt; and yet it's going on for
eighty years old, for she had it when she was a girl, and brought all
her clothes in it to father's, when they were married. But, as I was
saying, she did not cry, though the tears was often in her eyes; and
I seen her looking after me down the lane as long as I were in sight,
with her hand shading her eyes--and that were the last look I ever
had on her."

Alice knew that before long she should go to that mother; and,
besides, the griefs and bitter woes of youth have worn themselves out
before we grow old; but she looked so sorrowful that the girls caught
her sadness, and mourned for the poor woman who had been dead and
gone so many years ago.

"Did you never see her again, Alice? Did you never go home while she
was alive?" asked Mary.

"No, nor since. Many a time and oft have I planned to go. I plan
it yet, and hope to go home again before it please God to take me.
I used to try and save money enough to go for a week when I was in
service; but first one thing came, and then another. First, missis's
children fell ill of the measles, just when th' week I'd ask'd for
came, and I couldn't leave them, for one and all cried for me to
nurse them. Then missis herself fell sick, and I could go less than
ever. For, you see, they kept a little shop, and he drank, and missis
and me was all there was to mind children, and shop, and all, and
cook and wash besides."

Mary was glad she had not gone into service, and said so.

"Eh, lass! thou little knows the pleasure o' helping others; I was as
happy there as could be; almost as happy as I was at home. Well, but
next year I thought I could go at a leisure time, and missis telled
me I should have a fortnight then, and I used to sit up all that
winter working hard at patchwork, to have a quilt of my own making
to take to my mother. But master died, and missis went away fra
Manchester, and I'd to look out for a place again."

"Well, but," interrupted Mary, "I should have thought that was the
best time to go home."

"No, I thought not. You see it was a different thing going home for
a week on a visit, may be with money in my pocket to give father a
lift, to going home to be a burden to him. Besides, how could I hear
o' a place there? Anyways I thought it best to stay, though perhaps
it might have been better to ha' gone, for then I should ha' seen
mother again;" and the poor old woman looked puzzled.

"I'm sure you did what you thought right," said Margaret, gently.

"Ay, lass, that's it," said Alice, raising her head and speaking more
cheerfully. "That's the thing, and then let the Lord send what He
sees fit; not but that I grieved sore, oh, sore and sad, when toward
spring next year, when my quilt were all done to th' lining, George
came in one evening to tell me mother was dead. I cried many a
night at after; [3] I'd no time for crying by day, for that missis
was terrible strict; she would not hearken to my going to th'
funeral; and indeed I would have been too late, for George set off
that very night by th' coach, and th' letter had been kept or summut
(posts were not like th' posts now-a-days), and he found the burial
all over, and father talking o' flitting; for he couldn't abide the
cottage after mother was gone."


   [Footnote 3: A common Lancashire phrase. "Come to me, Tyrrel,
                soon, _at after_ supper." SHAKSPEARE, Richard III.]


"Was it a pretty place?" asked Mary.

"Pretty, lass! I never seed such a bonny bit anywhere. You see there
are hills there as seem to go up into th' skies, not near may be, but
that makes them all the bonnier. I used to think they were the golden
hills of heaven, about which my mother sang when I was a child,

   'Yon are the golden hills o' heaven,
      Where ye sall never win.'

Something about a ship and a lover that should hae been na lover,
the ballad was. Well, and near our cottage were rocks. Eh, lasses!
ye don't know what rocks are in Manchester! Gray pieces o' stone as
large as a house, all covered over wi' moss of different colours,
some yellow, some brown; and the ground beneath them knee-deep in
purple heather, smelling sae sweet and fragrant, and the low music of
the humming-bee for ever sounding among it. Mother used to send Sally
and me out to gather ling and heather for besoms, and it was such
pleasant work! We used to come home of an evening loaded so as you
could not see us, for all that it was so light to carry. And then
mother would make us sit down under the old hawthorn tree (where
we used to make our house among the great roots as stood above th'
ground), to pick and tie up the heather. It seems all like yesterday,
and yet it's a long long time agone. Poor sister Sally has been
in her grave this forty year and more. But I often wonder if the
hawthorn is standing yet, and if the lasses still go to gather
heather, as we did many and many a year past and gone. I sicken at
heart to see the old spot once again. May be next summer I may set
off, if God spares me to see next summer."

"Why have you never been in all these many years?" asked Mary.

"Why, lass! first one wanted me and then another; and I couldn't
go without money either, and I got very poor at times. Tom was a
scapegrace, poor fellow, and always wanted help of one kind or
another; and his wife (for I think scapegraces are always married
long before steady folk) was but a helpless kind of body. She were
always ailing, and he were always in trouble; so I had enough to do
with my hands and my money too, for that matter. They died within
twelvemonth of each other, leaving one lad (they had had seven, but
the Lord had taken six to Himself), Will, as I was telling you on;
and I took him myself, and left service to make a bit on a home-place
for him, and a fine lad he was, the very spit of his father as to
looks, only steadier. For he was steady, although nought would serve
him but going to sea. I tried all I could to set him again a sailor's
life. Says I, 'Folks is as sick as dogs all the time they're at sea.
Your own mother telled me (for she came from foreign parts, being a
Manx woman) that she'd ha thanked any one for throwing her into the
water.' Nay, I sent him a' the way to Runcorn by th' Duke's canal,
that he might know what th' sea were; and I looked to see him come
back as white as a sheet wi' vomiting. But the lad went on to
Liverpool and saw real ships, and came back more set than ever on
being a sailor, and he said as how he had never been sick at all, and
thought he could stand the sea pretty well. So I telled him he mun
do as he liked; and he thanked me and kissed me, for all I was very
frabbit [4] with him; and now he's gone to South America, at t'other
side of the sun, they tell me."


   [Footnote 4: "Frabbit," peevish.]


Mary stole a glance at Margaret to see what she thought of Alice's
geography; but Margaret looked so quiet and demure, that Mary was in
doubt if she were not really ignorant. Not that Mary's knowledge was
very profound, but she had seen a terrestrial globe, and knew where
to find France and the continents on a map.

After this long talking Alice seemed lost for a time in reverie; and
the girls, respecting her thoughts, which they suspected had wandered
to the home and scenes of her childhood, were silent. All at once she
recalled her duties as hostess, and by an effort brought back her
mind to the present time.

"Margaret, thou must let Mary hear thee sing. I don't know about fine
music myself, but folks say Margaret is a rare singer, and I know she
can make me cry at any time by singing 'Th' Owdham Weaver.' Do sing
that, Margaret, there's a good lass."

With a faint smile, as if amused at Alice's choice of a song,
Margaret began.

Do you know "The Oldham Weaver?" Not unless you are Lancashire born
and bred, for it is a complete Lancashire ditty. I will copy it for
you.


   THE OLDHAM WEAVER.

   I.

   Oi'm a poor cotton-weyver, as mony a one knoowas,
   Oi've nowt for t' yeat, an' oi've woorn eawt my clooas,

   Owd Dicky o' Billy's kept telling me lung,

      Owd Dicky's weel crammed,
      He never wur clemmed,
   An' he ne'er picked ower i' his loife. [6]

   III.

   We tow'rt on six week--thinking aitch day wur th' last,
   We shifted, an' shifted, till neaw we're quoite fast;
   We lived upo' nettles, whoile nettles wur good,
   An' Waterloo porridge the best o' eawr food,
      Oi'm tellin' yo' true,
      Oi can find folk enow,
   As wur livin' na better nor me.

   IV.

   Owd Billy o' Dans sent th' baileys one day,
   Fur a shop deebt oi eawd him, as oi could na pay,
   But he wur too lat, fur owd Billy o' th' Bent,
   Had sowd th' tit an' cart, an' ta'en goods fur th' rent,
      We'd neawt left bo' th' owd stoo',
      That wur seeats fur two,
   An' on it ceawred Marget an' me.

   V.

   Then t' baileys leuked reawnd as sloy as a meawse,
   When they seed as aw t' goods were ta'en eawt o' t' heawse,
   Says one chap to th' tother, "Aws gone, theaw may see;"
   Says oi, "Ne'er freet, mon, yeaur welcome ta' me."
      They made no moor ado
      But whopped up th' eawd stoo',
   An' we booath leet, whack--upo' t' flags!

   VI.

   Then oi said to eawr Marget, as we lay upo' t' floor,
   "We's never be lower i' this warld, oi'm sure,
   If ever things awtern, oi'm sure they mun mend,
   For oi think i' my heart we're booath at t' far eend;
      For meeat we ha' none;
      Nor looms t' weyve on,--
   Edad! they're as good lost as fund."

   VII.

   Eawr Marget declares had hoo cloo'as to put on,
   Hoo'd goo up to Lunnon an' talk to th' greet mon;
   An' if things were na awtered when there hoo had been,
   Hoo's fully resolved t' sew up meawth an' eend;
      Hoo's neawt to say again t' king,
      But hoo loikes a fair thing,
   An' hoo says hoo can tell when hoo's hurt.


   [Footnote 5: "Clem," to starve with hunger. "Hard is the
                choice, when the valiant must eat their arms
                or _clem_."--_Ben Jonson._]

   [Footnote 6: To "pick ower," means to throw the shuttle in
                hand-loom weaving.]


The air to which this is sung is a kind of droning recitative,
depending much on expression and feeling. To read it, it may,
perhaps, seem humorous; but it is that humour which is near akin
to pathos, and to those who have seen the distress it describes,
it is a powerfully pathetic song. Margaret had both witnessed the
destitution, and had the heart to feel it; and withal, her voice was
of that rich and rare order, which does not require any great compass
of notes to make itself appreciated. Alice had her quiet enjoyment of
tears. But Margaret, with fixed eye, and earnest, dreamy look, seemed
to become more and more absorbed in realising to herself the woe she
had been describing, and which she felt might at that very moment be
suffering and hopeless within a short distance of their comparative
comfort.

Suddenly she burst forth with all the power of her magnificent voice,
as if a prayer from her very heart for all who were in distress, in
the grand supplication, "Lord, remember David." Mary held her breath,
unwilling to lose a note, it was so clear, so perfect, so imploring.
A far more correct musician than Mary might have paused with equal
admiration of the really scientific knowledge, with which the poor
depressed-looking young needle-woman used her superb and flexile
voice. Deborah Travers herself (once an Oldham factory girl, and
afterwards the darling of fashionable crowds as Mrs. Knyvett) might
have owned a sister in her art.

She stopped; and with tears of holy sympathy in her eyes, Alice
thanked the songstress, who resumed her calm, demure manner, much to
Mary's wonder, for she looked at her unweariedly, as if surprised
that the hidden power should not be perceived in the outward
appearance.

When Alice's little speech of thanks was over, there was quiet enough
to hear a fine, though rather quavering, male voice, going over again
one or two strains of Margaret's song.

"That's grandfather!" exclaimed she. "I must be going, for he said he
should not be at home till past nine."

"Well, I'll not say nay, for I've to be up by four for a very heavy
wash at Mrs. Simpson's; but I shall be terrible glad to see you again
at any time, lasses; and I hope you'll take to one another."

As the girls ran up the cellar steps together, Margaret said: "Just
step in and see grandfather. I should like him to see you."

And Mary consented.




CHAPTER V.

THE MILL ON FIRE--JEM WILSON TO THE RESCUE.


   Learned he was; nor bird, nor insect flew,
   But he its leafy home and history knew;
   Nor wild-flower decked the rock, nor moss the well,
   But he its name and qualities could tell.

   ELLIOTT.


There is a class of men in Manchester, unknown even to many of the
inhabitants, and whose existence will probably be doubted by many,
who yet may claim kindred with all the noble names that science
recognises. I said "in Manchester," but they are scattered all over
the manufacturing districts of Lancashire. In the neighbourhood of
Oldham there are weavers, common hand-loom weavers, who throw the
shuttle with unceasing sound, though Newton's "Principia" lie open on
the loom, to be snatched at in work hours, but revelled over in meal
times, or at night. Mathematical problems are received with interest,
and studied with absorbing attention by many a broad-spoken,
common-looking, factory-hand. It is perhaps less astonishing that the
more popularly interesting branches of natural history have their
warm and devoted followers among this class. There are botanists
among them, equally familiar with either the Linnæan or the Natural
system, who know the name and habitat of every plant within a day's
walk from their dwellings; who steal the holiday of a day or two when
any particular plant should be in flower, and tying up their simple
food in their pocket-handkerchiefs, set off with single purpose to
fetch home the humble-looking weed. There are entomologists, who may
be seen with a rude-looking net, ready to catch any winged insect,
or a kind of dredge, with which they rake the green and slimy pools;
practical, shrewd, hard-working men, who pore over every new specimen
with real scientific delight. Nor is it the common and more obvious
divisions of Entomology and Botany that alone attract these earnest
seekers after knowledge. Perhaps it may be owing to the great annual
town-holiday of Whitsun-week so often falling in May or June that the
two great, beautiful families of Ephemeridæ and Phryganidæ have been
so much and so closely studied by Manchester workmen, while they have
in a great measure escaped general observation. If you will refer
to the preface to Sir J. E. Smith's Life (I have it not by me, or
I would copy you the exact passage), you will find that he names
a little circumstance corroborative of what I have said. Sir J. E.
Smith, being on a visit to Roscoe, of Liverpool, made some inquiries
from him as to the habitat of a very rare plant, said to be found in
certain places in Lancashire. Mr. Roscoe knew nothing of the plant;
but stated, that if any one could give him the desired information,
it would be a hand-loom weaver in Manchester, whom he named. Sir J.
E. Smith proceeded by coach to Manchester, and on arriving at that
town, he inquired of the porter who was carrying his luggage if he
could direct him to So and So.

"Oh, yes," replied the man. "He does a bit in my way;" and, on
further investigation, it turned out, that both the porter, and his
friend the weaver, were skilful botanists, and able to give Sir J. E.
Smith the very information which he wanted.

Such are the tastes and pursuits of some of the thoughtful, little
understood, working men of Manchester.

And Margaret's grandfather was one of these. He was a little
wiry-looking old man, who moved with a jerking motion, as if his
limbs were worked by a string like a child's toy, with dun coloured
hair lying thin and soft at the back and sides of his head; his
forehead was so large it seemed to overbalance the rest of his face,
which had indeed lost its natural contour by the absence of all the
teeth. The eyes absolutely gleamed with intelligence; so keen, so
observant, you felt as if they were almost wizard-like. Indeed, the
whole room looked not unlike a wizard's dwelling. Instead of pictures
were hung rude wooden frames of impaled insects; the little table was
covered with cabalistic books; and a case of mysterious instruments
lay beside, one of which Job Legh was using when his grand-daughter
entered.

On her appearance he pushed his spectacles up so as to rest midway
on his forehead, and gave Mary a short, kind welcome. But Margaret
he caressed as a mother caresses her first-born; stroking her with
tenderness, and almost altering his voice as he spoke to her.

Mary looked round on the odd, strange things she had never seen at
home, and which seemed to her to have a very uncanny look.

"Is your grandfather a fortune-teller?" whispered she to her new
friend.

"No," replied Margaret, in the same voice; "but you're not the first
as has taken him for such. He is only fond of such things as most
folks know nothing about."

"And do you know aught about them, too?"

"I know a bit about some of the things grandfather is fond on; just
because he's fond on 'em I tried to learn about them."

"What things are these?" said Mary, struck with the weird looking
creatures that sprawled around the room in their roughly-made glass
cases.

But she was not prepared for the technical names which Job Legh
pattered down on her ear, on which they fell like hail on a skylight;
and the strange language only bewildered her more than ever. Margaret
saw the state of the case, and came to the rescue.

"Look, Mary, at this horrid scorpion. He gave me such a fright:
I'm all of a twitter yet when I think of it. Grandfather went to
Liverpool one Whitsun-week to go strolling about the docks and pick
up what he could from the sailors, who often bring some queer thing
or another from the hot countries they go to; and so he sees a chap
with a bottle in his hand, like a druggist's physic-bottle; and says
grandfather, 'What have ye gotten there?' So the sailor holds it up,
and grandfather knew it was a rare kind o' scorpion, not common even
in the East Indies where the man came from; and says he, 'How did
ye catch this fine fellow, for he wouldn't be taken for nothing I'm
thinking?' And the man said as how when they were unloading the ship
he'd found him lying behind a bag of rice, and he thought the cold
had killed him, for he was not squashed nor injured a bit. He did
not like to part with any of the spirit out of his grog to put the
scorpion in, but slipped him into the bottle, knowing there were
folks enow who would give him something for him. So grandfather gives
him a shilling."

"Two shilling," interrupted Job Legh, "and a good bargain it was."

"Well! grandfather came home as proud as Punch, and pulled the bottle
out of his pocket. But you see th' scorpion were doubled up, and
grandfather thought I couldn't fairly see how big he was. So he
shakes him out right before the fire; and a good warm one it was, for
I was ironing, I remember. I left off ironing, and stooped down over
him, to look at him better, and grandfather got a book, and began to
read how this very kind were the most poisonous and vicious species,
how their bite were often fatal, and then went on to read how people
who were bitten got swelled, and screamed with pain. I was listening
hard, but as it fell out, I never took my eyes off the creature,
though I could not ha' told I was watching it. Suddenly it seemed
to give a jerk, and before I could speak, it gave another, and in
a minute it was as wild as could be, running at me just like a mad
dog."

"What did you do?" asked Mary.

"Me! why, I jumped first on a chair, and then on all the things I'd
been ironing on the dresser, and I screamed for grandfather to come
up by me, but he did not hearken to me."

"Why, if I'd come up by thee, who'd ha' caught the creature, I should
like to know?"

"Well, I begged grandfather to crush it, and I had the iron right
over it once, ready to drop, but grandfather begged me not to hurt it
in that way. So I couldn't think what he'd have, for he hopped round
the room as if he were sore afraid, for all he begged me not to
injure it. At last he goes to th' kettle, and lifts up the lid, and
peeps in. What on earth is he doing that for, thinks I; he'll never
drink his tea with a scorpion running free and easy about the room.
Then he takes the tongs, and he settles his spectacles on his nose,
and in a minute he had lifted the creature up by th' leg, and dropped
him into the boiling water."

"And did that kill him?" said Mary.

"Ay, sure enough; he boiled for longer time than grandfather liked
though. But I was so afeard of his coming round again. I ran to the
public-house for some gin, and grandfather filled the bottle, and
then we poured off the water, and picked him out of the kettle, and
dropped him into the bottle, and he were there above a twelvemonth."

"What brought him to life at first?" asked Mary.

"Why, you see, he were never really dead, only torpid--that is, dead
asleep with the cold, and our good fire brought him round."

"I'm glad father does not care for such things," said Mary.

"Are you! Well, I'm often downright glad grandfather is so fond of
his books, and his creatures, and his plants. It does my heart good
to see him so happy, sorting them all at home, and so ready to go in
search of more, whenever he's a spare day. Look at him now! he's gone
back to his books, and he'll be as happy as a king, working away till
I make him go to bed. It keeps him silent, to be sure; but so long
as I see him earnest, and pleased, and eager, what does that matter?
Then, when he has his talking bouts, you can't think how much he has
to say. Dear grandfather! you don't know how happy we are!"

Mary wondered if the dear grandfather heard all this, for Margaret
did not speak in an under tone; but no! he was far too deep and eager
in solving a problem. He did not even notice Mary's leave-taking,
and she went home with the feeling that she had that night made the
acquaintance of two of the strangest people she ever saw in her life.
Margaret, so quiet, so common place, until her singing powers were
called forth; so silent from home, so cheerful and agreeable at home;
and her grandfather so very different to any one Mary had ever seen.
Margaret had said he was not a fortune-teller, but she did not know
whether to believe her.

To resolve her doubts, she told the history of the evening to her
father, who was interested by her account, and curious to see
and judge for himself. Opportunities are not often wanting where
inclination goes before, and ere the end of that winter Mary looked
upon Margaret almost as an old friend. The latter would bring her
work when Mary was likely to be at home in the evenings and sit with
her; and Job Legh would put a book and his pipe in his pocket and
just step round the corner to fetch his grand-child, ready for a talk
if he found Barton in; ready to pull out pipe and book if the girls
wanted him to wait, and John was still at his club. In short, ready
to do whatever would give pleasure to his darling Margaret.

I do not know what points of resemblance (or dissimilitude, for the
one joins people as often as the other) attracted the two girls to
each other. Margaret had the great charm of possessing good strong
common sense, and do you not perceive how involuntarily this is
valued? It is so pleasant to have a friend who possesses the power
of setting a difficult question in a clear light; whose judgment can
tell what is best to be done; and who is so convinced of what is
"wisest, best," that in consideration of the end, all difficulties
in the way diminish. People admire talent, and talk about their
admiration. But they value common sense without talking about it, and
often without knowing it.

So Mary and Margaret grew in love one toward the other; and Mary told
many of her feelings in a way she had never done before to any one.
Most of her foibles also were made known to Margaret, but not all.
There was one cherished weakness still concealed from every one. It
concerned a lover, not beloved, but favoured by fancy. A gallant,
handsome young man; but--not beloved. Yet Mary hoped to meet him
every day in her walks, blushed when she heard his name, and tried
to think of him as her future husband, and above all, tried to think
of herself as his future wife. Alas! poor Mary! Bitter woe did thy
weakness work thee.

She had other lovers. One or two would gladly have kept her company,
but she held herself too high, they said. Jem Wilson said nothing,
but loved on and on, ever more fondly; he hoped against hope; he
would not give up, for it seemed like giving up life to give up
thought of Mary. He did not dare to look to any end of all this; the
present, so that he saw her, touched the hem of her garment, was
enough. Surely, in time, such deep love would beget love.

He would not relinquish hope, and yet her coldness of manner was
enough to daunt any man; and it made Jem more despairing than he
would acknowledge for a long time even to himself.

But one evening he came round by Barton's house, a willing messenger
for his father, and opening the door saw Margaret sitting asleep
before the fire. She had come in to speak to Mary; and worn out by a
long working, watching night, she fell asleep in the genial warmth.

An old-fashioned saying about a pair of gloves came into Jem's mind,
and stepping gently up he kissed Margaret with a friendly kiss.

She awoke, and perfectly understanding the thing, she said, "For
shame of yourself, Jem! What would Mary say?"

Lightly said, lightly answered.

"She'd nobbut say, practice makes perfect." And they both laughed.
But the words Margaret had said rankled in Jem's mind. Would Mary
care? Would she care in the very least? They seemed to call for an
answer by night, and by day; and Jem felt that his heart told him
Mary was quite indifferent to any action of his. Still he loved on,
and on, ever more fondly.

Mary's father was well aware of the nature of Jem Wilson's feelings
for his daughter, but he took no notice of them to any one, thinking
Mary full young yet for the cares of married life, and unwilling,
too, to entertain the idea of parting with her at any time, however
distant. But he welcomed Jem at his house, as he would have done his
father's son, whatever were his motives for coming; and now and then
admitted the thought, that Mary might do worse when her time came,
than marry Jem Wilson, a steady workman at a good trade, a good son
to his parents, and a fine manly spirited chap--at least when Mary
was not by: for when she was present he watched her too closely, and
too anxiously, to have much of what John Barton called "spunk" in
him.

It was towards the end of February, in that year, and a bitter black
frost had lasted for many weeks. The keen east wind had long since
swept the streets clean, though on a gusty day the dust would rise
like pounded ice, and make people's faces quite smart with the cold
force with which it blew against them. Houses, sky, people, and every
thing looked as if a gigantic brush had washed them all over with
a dark shade of Indian ink. There was some reason for this grimy
appearance on human beings, whatever there might be for the dun looks
of the landscape; for soft water had become an article not even to
be purchased; and the poor washerwomen might be seen vainly trying
to procure a little by breaking the thick gray ice that coated the
ditches and ponds in the neighbourhood. People prophesied a long
continuance to this already lengthened frost; said the spring would
be very late; no spring fashions required; no summer clothing
purchased for a short uncertain summer. Indeed there was no end to
the evil prophesied during the continuance of that bleak east wind.

Mary hurried home one evening, just as daylight was fading, from Miss
Simmonds', with her shawl held up to her mouth, and her head bent
as if in deprecation of the meeting wind. So she did not perceive
Margaret till, she was close upon her at the very turning into the
court.

"Bless me, Margaret! is that you? Where are you bound to?"

"To nowhere but your own house (that is, if you'll take me in). I've
a job of work to finish to-night; mourning, as must be in time for
the funeral to-morrow; and grandfather has been out moss-hunting, and
will not be home till late."

"Oh, how charming it will be. I'll help you if you're backward. Have
you much to do?"

"Yes, I only got the order yesterday at noon; and there's three girls
beside the mother; and what with trying on and matching the stuff
(for there was not enough in the piece they chose first), I'm above
a bit behindhand. I've the skirts all to make. I kept that work till
candlelight; and the sleeves, to say nothing of little bits to the
bodies; for the missis is very particular, and I could scarce keep
from smiling while they were crying so, really taking on sadly I'm
sure, to hear first one and then t'other clear up to notice the sit
of her gown. They weren't to be misfits I promise you, though they
were in such trouble."

"Well, Margaret, you're right welcome as you know, and I'll sit down
and help you with pleasure, though I was tired enough of sewing
to-night at Miss Simmonds'."

By this time Mary had broken up the raking coal, and lighted her
candle; and Margaret settled herself to her work on one side of the
table, while her friend hurried over her tea at the other. The things
were then lifted _en masse_ to the dresser; and dusting her side of
the table with the apron she always wore at home, Mary took up some
breadths and began to run them together.

"Who's it all for, for if you told me I've forgotten?"

"Why for Mrs. Ogden as keeps the greengrocer's shop in Oxford Road.
Her husband drank himself to death, and though she cried over him and
his ways all the time he was alive, she's fretted sadly for him now
he's dead."

"Has he left her much to go upon?" asked Mary, examining the texture
of the dress. "This is beautifully fine soft bombazine."

"No, I'm much afeared there's but little, and there's several young
children, besides the three Miss Ogdens."

"I should have thought girls like them would ha' made their own
gowns," observed Mary.

"So I dare say they do, many a one, but now they seem all so busy
getting ready for the funeral; for it's to be quite a grand affair,
well-nigh twenty people to breakfast, as one of the little ones told
me; the little thing seemed to like the fuss, and I do believe it
comforted poor Mrs. Ogden to make all the piece o' work. Such a smell
of ham boiling and fowls roasting while I waited in the kitchen; it
seemed more like a wedding nor [7] a funeral. They said she'd spend a
matter o' sixty pound on th' burial."


   [Footnote 7: "Nor," generally used in Lancashire for "than."
                "They had lever sleep _nor_ be in
                laundery."--_Dunbar_.]


"I thought you said she was but badly off," said Mary.

"Ay, I know she's asked for credit at several places, saying her
husband laid hands on every farthing he could get for drink. But th'
undertakers urge her on you see, and tell her this thing's usual,
and that thing's only a common mark of respect, and that every body
has t'other thing, till the poor woman has no will o' her own. I
dare say, too, her heart strikes her (it always does when a person's
gone) for many a word and many a slighting deed to him, who's stiff
and cold; and she thinks to make up matters, as it were, by a grand
funeral, though she and all her children, too, may have to pinch many
a year to pay the expenses, if ever they pay them at all."

"This mourning, too, will cost a pretty penny," said Mary. "I often
wonder why folks wear mourning; it's not pretty or becoming; and it
costs a deal of money just when people can spare it least; and if
what the Bible tells us be true, we ought not to be sorry when a
friend, who's been good, goes to his rest; and as for a bad man,
one's glad enough to get shut [8] on him. I cannot see what good
comes out o' wearing mourning."


   [Footnote 8: "Shut," quit.]


"I'll tell you what I think th' fancy was sent for (Old Alice calls
every thing 'sent for,' and I believe she's right). It does do good,
though not as much as it costs, that I do believe, in setting people
(as is cast down by sorrow and feels themselves unable to settle to
any thing but crying) something to do. Why now I told you how they
were grieving; for, perhaps, he was a kind husband and father, in
his thoughtless way, when he wasn't in liquor. But they cheered up
wonderful while I was there, and I asked 'em for more directions than
usual, that they might have something to talk over and fix about; and
I left 'em my fashion-book (though it were two months old) just a
purpose."

"I don't think every one would grieve a that way. Old Alice
wouldn't."

"Old Alice is one in a thousand. I doubt, too, if she would fret
much, however sorry she might be. She would say it were sent, and
fall to trying to find out what good it were to do. Every sorrow in
her mind is sent for good. Did I ever tell you, Mary, what she said
one day when she found me taking on about something?"

"No; do tell me. What were you fretting about, first place?"

"I can't tell you just now; perhaps I may sometime."

"When?"

"Perhaps this very evening, if it rises in my heart; perhaps never.
It's a fear that sometimes I can't abide to think about, and
sometimes I don't like to think on any thing else. Well, I was
fretting about this fear, and Alice comes in for something, and finds
me crying. I would not tell her no more than I would you, Mary; so
she says, 'Well, dear, you must mind this, when you're going to fret
and be low about any thing, "An anxious mind is never a holy mind."'
Oh, Mary, I have so often checked my grumbling sin' [9] she said
that."


   [Footnote 9: "Sin'," since. "_Sin_ that his lord was twenty
                yere of age." _Prologue to Canterbury Tales._]


The weary sound of stitching was the only sound heard for a little
while, till Mary inquired,

"Do you expect to get paid for this mourning?"

"Why I do not much think I shall. I've thought it over once or twice,
and I mean to bring myself to think I shan't, and to like to do it as
my bit towards comforting them. I don't think they can pay, and yet
they're just the sort of folk to have their minds easier for wearing
mourning. There's only one thing I dislike making black for, it does
so hurt the eyes."

Margaret put down her work with a sigh, and shaded her eyes. Then she
assumed a cheerful tone, and said,

"You'll not have to wait long, Mary, for my secret's on the tip of
my tongue. Mary! do you know I sometimes think I'm growing a little
blind, and then what would become of grandfather and me? Oh, God help
me, Lord help me!"

She fell into an agony of tears, while Mary knelt by her, striving
to soothe and to comfort her; but, like an inexperienced person,
striving rather to deny the correctness of Margaret's fear, than
helping her to meet and overcome the evil.

"No," said Margaret, quietly fixing her tearful eyes on Mary; "I know
I'm not mistaken. I have felt one going some time, long before I ever
thought what it would lead to; and last autumn I went to a doctor;
and he did not mince the matter, but said unless I sat in a darkened
room, with my hands before me, my sight would not last me many years
longer. But how could I do that, Mary? For one thing, grandfather
would have known there was somewhat the matter; and, oh! it will
grieve him sore whenever he's told, so the later the better; and
besides, Mary, we've sometimes little enough to go upon, and what
I earn is a great help. For grandfather takes a day here, and a day
there, for botanising or going after insects, and he'll think little
enough of four or five shillings for a specimen; dear grandfather!
and I'm so loath to think he should be stinted of what gives him
such pleasure. So I went to another doctor to try and get him to say
something different, and he said, 'Oh, it was only weakness,' and
gived me a bottle of lotion; but I've used three bottles (and each of
'em cost two shillings), and my eye is so much worse, not hurting so
much, but I can't see a bit with it. There now, Mary," continued she,
shutting one eye, "now you only look like a great black shadow, with
the edges dancing and sparkling."

"And can you see pretty well with th' other?"

"Yes, pretty near as well as ever. Th' only difference is, that if
I sew a long time together, a bright spot like th' sun comes right
where I'm looking; all the rest is quite clear but just where I want
to see. I've been to both doctors again, and now they're both o' the
same story; and I suppose I'm going dark as fast as may be. Plain
work pays so bad, and mourning has been so plentiful this winter, I
were tempted to take in any black work I could; and now I'm suffering
from it."

"And yet, Margaret, you're going on taking it in; that's what you'd
call foolish in another."

"It is, Mary! and yet what can I do? Folk mun live; and I think I
should go blind any way, and I darn't tell grandfather, else I would
leave it off, but he will so fret."

Margaret rocked herself backward and forward to still her emotion.

"Oh Mary!" she said, "I try to get his face off by heart, and I stare
at him so when he's not looking, and then shut my eyes to see if I
can remember his dear face. There's one thing, Mary, that serves a
bit to comfort me. You'll have heard of old Jacob Butterworth, the
singing weaver? Well, I know'd him a bit, so I went to him, and said
how I wished he'd teach me the right way o' singing; and he says
I've a rare fine voice, and I go once a week, and take a lesson fra'
him. He's been a grand singer in his day. He's led th' chorusses at
the Festivals, and got thanked many a time by London folk; and one
foreign singer, Madame Catalani, turned round and shook him by th'
hand before the Oud Church [10] full o' people. He says I may gain
ever so much money by singing; but I don't know. Any rate it's sad
work, being blind."


   [Footnote 10: "Old Church;" now the Cathedral of Manchester.]


She took up her sewing, saying her eyes were rested now, and for some
time they sewed on in silence.

Suddenly there were steps heard in the little paved court; person
after person ran past the curtained window.

"Something's up," said Mary. She went to the door and stopping the
first person she saw, inquired the cause of the commotion.

"Eh, wench! donna ye see the fire-light? Carsons' mill is blazing
away like fun;" and away her informant ran.

"Come, Margaret, on wi' your bonnet, and let's go to see Carsons'
mill; it's afire, and they say a burning mill is such a grand sight.
I never saw one."

"Well, I think it's a fearful sight. Besides I've all this work to
do."

But Mary coaxed in her sweet manner, and with her gentle caresses,
promising to help with the gowns all night long if necessary, nay,
saying she should quite enjoy it.

The truth was, Margaret's secret weighed heavily and painfully on her
mind, and she felt her inability to comfort; besides, she wanted to
change the current of Margaret's thoughts; and in addition to these
unselfish feelings, came the desire she had honestly expressed, of
seeing a factory on fire.

So in two minutes they were ready. At the threshold of the house they
met John Barton, to whom they told their errand.

"Carsons' mill! Ay, there is a mill on fire somewhere, sure enough,
by the light, and it will be a rare blaze, for there's not a drop
o' water to be got. And much Carsons will care, for they're well
insured, and the machines are a' th' oud-fashioned kind. See if they
don't think it a fine thing for themselves. They'll not thank them as
tries to put it out."

He gave way for the impatient girls to pass. Guided by the ruddy
light more than by any exact knowledge of the streets that led to the
mill, they scampered along with bent heads, facing the terrible east
wind as best they might.

Carsons' mill ran lengthways from east to west. Along it went one
of the oldest thoroughfares in Manchester. Indeed all that part of
the town was comparatively old; it was there that the first cotton
mills were built, and the crowded alleys and back streets of the
neighbourhood made a fire there particularly to be dreaded. The
staircase of the mill ascended from the entrance at the western end,
which faced into a wide dingy-looking street, consisting principally
of public-houses, pawn-brokers' shops, rag and bone warehouses,
and dirty provision shops. The other, the east end of the factory,
fronted into a very narrow back street, not twenty feet wide, and
miserably lighted and paved. Right against this end of the factory
were the gable ends of the last house in the principal street--a
house which from its size, its handsome stone facings, and the
attempt at ornament in the front, had probably been once a
gentleman's house; but now the light which streamed from its enlarged
front windows made clear the interior of the splendidly fitted up
room, with its painted walls, its pillared recesses, its gilded and
gorgeous fittings up, its miserable, squalid inmates. It was a gin
palace.

Mary almost wished herself away, so fearful (as Margaret had said)
was the sight when they joined the crowd assembled to witness the
fire. There was a murmur of many voices whenever the roaring of the
flames ceased for an instant. It was easy to perceive the mass were
deeply interested.

"What do they say?" asked Margaret, of a neighbour in the crowd, as
she caught a few words, clear and distinct, from the general murmur.

"There never is anyone in the mill, surely!" exclaimed Mary, as the
sea of upward-turned faces moved with one accord to the eastern end,
looking into Dunham Street, the narrow back lane already mentioned.

The western end of the mill, whither the raging flames were driven
by the wind, was crowned and turreted with triumphant fire. It sent
forth its infernal tongues from every window hole, licking the black
walls with amorous fierceness; it was swayed or fell before the
mighty gale, only to rise higher and yet higher, to ravage and roar
yet more wildly. This part of the roof fell in with an astounding
crash, while the crowd struggled more and more to press into Dunham
Street, for what were magnificent terrible flames, what were falling
timbers or tottering walls, in comparison with human life?

There, where the devouring flames had been repelled by the yet more
powerful wind, but where yet black smoke gushed out from every
aperture, there, at one of the windows on the fourth story, or
rather a doorway where a crane was fixed to hoist up goods, might
occasionally be seen, when the thick gusts of smoke cleared partially
away for an instant, the imploring figures of two men. They had
remained after the rest of the workmen for some reason or other, and,
owing to the wind having driven the fire in the opposite direction,
had perceived no sight or sound of alarm, till long after (if any
thing could be called long in that throng of terrors which passed by
in less time than half an hour) the fire had consumed the old wooden
staircase at the other end of the building. I am not sure whether it
was not the first sound of the rushing crowd below that made them
fully aware of their awful position.

"Where are the engines?" asked Margaret of her neighbour.

"They're coming, no doubt; but, bless you, I think it's bare ten
minutes since we first found out th' fire; it rages so wi' this wind,
and all so dry-like."

"Is no one gone for a ladder?" gasped Mary, as the men were
perceptibly, though not audibly, praying the great multitude below
for help.

"Ay, Wilson's son and another man were off like a shot, well nigh
five minute agone. But th' masons, and slaters, and such like, have
left their work, and locked up the yards."

Wilson! then, was that man whose figure loomed out against the ever
increasing dull hot light behind, whenever the smoke was clear,--was
that George Wilson? Mary sickened with terror. She knew he worked for
Carsons; but at first she had had no idea any lives were in danger;
and since she had become aware of this, the heated air, the roaring
flames, the dizzy light, and the agitated and murmuring crowd, had
bewildered her thoughts.

"Oh! let us go home, Margaret; I cannot stay."

"We cannot go! See how we are wedged in by folks. Poor Mary! ye won't
hanker after a fire again. Hark! listen!"

For through the hushed crowd, pressing round the angle of the mill,
and filling up Dunham Street, might be heard the rattle of the
engine, the heavy, quick tread of loaded horses.

"Thank God!" said Margaret's neighbour, "the engine's come."

Another pause; the plugs were stiff, and water could not be got.

Then there was a pressure through the crowd, the front rows bearing
back on those behind, till the girls were sick with the close ramming
confinement. Then a relaxation, and a breathing freely once more.

"'Twas young Wilson and a fireman wi' a ladder," said Margaret's
neighbour, a tall man who could overlook the crowd.

"Oh, tell us what you see?" begged Mary.

"They've gotten it fixed again the gin-shop wall. One o' the men i'
th' factory has fell back; dazed wi' the smoke, I'll warrant. The
floor's not given way there. God!" said he, bringing his eye lower
down, "th' ladder's too short! It's a' over wi' them, poor chaps. Th'
fire's coming slow and sure to that end, and afore they've either
gotten water, or another ladder, they'll be dead out and out. Lord
have mercy on them!"

A sob, as if of excited women, was heard in the hush of the crowd.
Another pressure like the former! Mary clung to Margaret's arm with
a pinching grasp, and longed to faint, and be insensible, to escape
from the oppressing misery of her sensations. A minute or two.

"They've taken th' ladder into th' Temple of Apollor. Can't press
back with it to the yard it came from."

A mighty shout arose; a sound to wake the dead. Up on high, quivering
in the air, was seen the end of the ladder, protruding out of a
garret window, in the gable end of the gin palace, nearly opposite to
the doorway where the men had been seen. Those in the crowd nearest
the factory, and consequently best able to see up to the garret
window, said that several men were holding one end, and guiding by
their weight its passage to the door-way. The garret window-frame had
been taken out before the crowd below were aware of the attempt.

At length--for it seemed long, measured by beating hearts, though
scarce two minutes had elapsed--the ladder was fixed, an aerial
bridge at a dizzy height, across the narrow street.

Every eye was fixed in unwinking anxiety, and people's very breathing
seemed stilled in suspense. The men were nowhere to be seen, but the
wind appeared, for the moment, higher than ever, and drove back the
invading flames to the other end.

Mary and Margaret could see now; right above them danced the ladder
in the wind. The crowd pressed back from under; firemen's helmets
appeared at the window, holding the ladder firm, when a man, with
quick, steady tread, and unmoving head, passed from one side to
the other. The multitude did not even whisper while he crossed the
perilous bridge, which quivered under him; but when he was across,
safe comparatively in the factory, a cheer arose for an instant,
checked, however, almost immediately, by the uncertainty of the
result, and the desire not in any way to shake the nerves of the
brave fellow who had cast his life on such a die.

"There he is again!" sprung to the lips of many, as they saw him at
the doorway, standing as if for an instant to breathe a mouthful of
the fresher air, before he trusted himself to cross. On his shoulders
he bore an insensible body.

"It's Jem Wilson and his father," whispered Margaret; but Mary knew
it before.

The people were sick with anxious terror. He could no longer balance
himself with his arms; every thing must depend on nerve and eye. They
saw the latter was fixed, by the position of the head, which never
wavered; the ladder shook under the double weight; but still he never
moved his head--he dared not look below. It seemed an age before the
crossing was accomplished. At last the window was gained; the bearer
relieved from his burden; both had disappeared.

Then the multitude might shout; and above the roaring flames, louder
than the blowing of the mighty wind, arose that tremendous burst of
applause at the success of the daring enterprise. Then a shrill cry
was heard, asking

"Is the oud man alive, and likely to do?"

"Ay," answered one of the firemen to the hushed crowd below. "He's
coming round finely, now he's had a dash of cowd water."

He drew back his head; and the eager inquiries, the shouts, the
sea-like murmurs of the moving rolling mass began again to be
heard--but for an instant though. In far less time than even that in
which I have endeavoured briefly to describe the pause of events, the
same bold hero stepped again upon the ladder, with evident purpose to
rescue the man yet remaining in the burning mill.

He went across in the same quick steady manner as before, and the
people below, made less acutely anxious by his previous success, were
talking to each other, shouting out intelligence of the progress of
the fire at the other end of the factory, telling of the endeavours
of the firemen at that part to obtain water, while the closely packed
body of men heaved and rolled from side to side. It was different
from the former silent breathless hush. I do not know if it were from
this cause, or from the recollection of peril past, or that he looked
below, in the breathing moment before returning with the remaining
person (a slight little man) slung across his shoulders, but Jem
Wilson's step was less steady, his tread more uncertain; he seemed to
feel with his foot for the next round of the ladder, to waver, and
finally to stop half-way. By this time the crowd was still enough;
in the awful instant that intervened no one durst speak, even to
encourage. Many turned sick with terror, and shut their eyes to avoid
seeing the catastrophe they dreaded. It came. The brave man swayed
from side to side, at first as slightly as if only balancing himself;
but he was evidently losing nerve, and even sense: it was only
wonderful how the animal instinct of self-preservation did not
overcome every generous feeling, and impel him at once to drop the
helpless, inanimate body he carried; perhaps the same instinct told
him, that the sudden loss of so heavy a weight would of itself be a
great and imminent danger.

"Help me! she's fainted," cried Margaret. But no one heeded. All eyes
were directed upwards. At this point of time a rope, with a running
noose, was dexterously thrown by one of the firemen, after the manner
of a lasso, over the head and round the bodies of the two men. True,
it was with rude and slight adjustment: but, slight as it was, it
served as a steadying guide; it encouraged the sinking heart, the
dizzy head. Once more Jem stepped onwards. He was not hurried by any
jerk or pull. Slowly and gradually the rope was hauled in, slowly and
gradually did he make the four or five paces between him and safety.
The window was gained, and all were saved. The multitude in the
street absolutely danced with triumph, and huzzaed and yelled till
you would have fancied their very throats would crack; and then with
all the fickleness of interest characteristic of a large body of
people, pressed and stumbled, and cursed and swore in the hurry to
get out of Dunham Street, and back to the immediate scene of the
fire, the mighty diapason of whose roaring flames formed an awful
accompaniment to the screams, and yells, and imprecations, of the
struggling crowd.

As they pressed away, Margaret was left, pale and almost sinking
under the weight of Mary's body, which she had preserved in an
upright position by keeping her arms tight round Mary's waist,
dreading, with reason, the trampling of unheeding feet.

Now, however, she gently let her down on the cold clean pavement; and
the change of posture, and the difference in temperature, now that
the people had withdrawn from their close neighbourhood, speedily
restored her to consciousness.

Her first glance was bewildered and uncertain. She had forgotten
where she was. Her cold, hard bed felt strange; the murky glare in
the sky affrighted her. She shut her eyes to think, to recollect.

Her next look was upwards. The fearful bridge had been withdrawn; the
window was unoccupied.

"They are safe," said Margaret.

"All? Are all safe, Margaret?" asked Mary.

"Ask yon fireman, and he'll tell you more about it than I can. But I
know they're all safe."

The fireman hastily corroborated Margaret's words.

"Why did you let Jem Wilson go twice?" asked Margaret.

"Let!--why we could not hinder him. As soon as ever he'd heard his
father speak (which he was na long a doing), Jem were off like a
shot; only saying he knowed better nor us where to find t'other man.
We'd all ha' gone, if he had na been in such a hurry, for no one can
say as Manchester firemen is ever backward when there's danger."

So saying, he ran off; and the two girls, without remark or
discussion, turned homewards. They were overtaken by the elder
Wilson, pale, grimy, and blear-eyed, but apparently as strong and
well as ever. He loitered a minute or two alongside of them, giving
an account of his detention in the mill; he then hastily wished
good-night, saying he must go home and tell his missis he was all
safe and well: but after he had gone a few steps, he turned back,
came on Mary's side of the pavement, and in an earnest whisper, which
Margaret could not avoid hearing, he said,

"Mary, if my boy comes across you to-night, give him a kind word or
two for my sake. Do! bless you, there's a good wench."

Mary hung her head and answered not a word, and in an instant he was
gone.

When they arrived at home, they found John Barton smoking his pipe,
unwilling to question, yet very willing to hear all the details
they could give him. Margaret went over the whole story, and it was
amusing to watch his gradually increasing interest and excitement.
First, the regular puffing abated, then ceased. Then the pipe was
fairly taken out of his mouth, and held suspended. Then he rose, and
at every further point he came a step nearer to the narrator.

When it was ended, he swore (an unusual thing for him) that if Jem
Wilson wanted Mary he should have her to-morrow, if he had not a
penny to keep her.

Margaret laughed, but Mary, who was now recovered from her agitation,
pouted, and looked angry.

The work which they had left was resumed: but with full hearts,
fingers never go very quickly; and I am sorry to say, that owing to
the fire, the two younger Miss Ogdens were in such grief for the loss
of their excellent father, that they were unable to appear before the
little circle of sympathising friends gathered together to comfort
the widow, and see the funeral set off.




CHAPTER VI.

POVERTY AND DEATH.


   "How little can the rich man know
     Of what the poor man feels,
   When Want, like some dark dæmon foe,
     Nearer and nearer steals!

   _He_ never tramp'd the weary round,
     A stroke of work to gain,
   And sicken'd at the dreaded sound
     Telling him 'twas in vain.

   Foot-sore, heart-sore, _he_ never came
     Back through the winter's wind,
   To a dark cellar, there no flame,
     No light, no food, to find.

   _He_ never saw his darlings lie
     Shivering, the flags their bed;
   _He_ never heard that maddening cry,
     'Daddy, a bit of bread!'"

   MANCHESTER SONG.


John Barton was not far wrong in his idea that the Messrs. Carson
would not be over much grieved for the consequences of the fire
in their mill. They were well insured; the machinery lacked the
improvements of late years, and worked but poorly in comparison with
that which might now be procured. Above all, trade was very slack;
cottons could find no market, and goods lay packed and piled in many
a warehouse. The mills were merely worked to keep the machinery,
human and metal, in some kind of order and readiness for better
times. So this was an excellent opportunity, Messrs. Carson thought,
for refitting their factory with first-rate improvements, for which
the insurance money would amply pay. They were in no hurry about
the business, however. The weekly drain of wages given for labour,
useless in the present state of the market, was stopped. The partners
had more leisure than they had known for years; and promised wives
and daughters all manner of pleasant excursions, as soon as the
weather should become more genial. It was a pleasant thing to be
able to lounge over breakfast with a review or newspaper in hand; to
have time for becoming acquainted with agreeable and accomplished
daughters, on whose education no money had been spared, but whose
fathers, shut up during a long day with calicoes and accounts, had
so seldom had leisure to enjoy their daughters' talents. There were
happy family evenings, now that the men of business had time for
domestic enjoyments. There is another side to the picture. There were
homes over which Carsons' fire threw a deep, terrible gloom; the
homes of those who would fain work, and no man gave unto them--the
homes of those to whom leisure was a curse. There, the family music
was hungry wails, when week after week passed by, and there was no
work to be had, and consequently no wages to pay for the bread the
children cried aloud for in their young impatience of suffering.
There was no breakfast to lounge over; their lounge was taken in bed,
to try and keep warmth in them that bitter March weather, and, by
being quiet, to deaden the gnawing wolf within. Many a penny that
would have gone little way enough in oatmeal or potatoes, bought
opium to still the hungry little ones, and make them forget their
uneasiness in heavy troubled sleep. It was mother's mercy. The
evil and the good of our nature came out strongly then. There were
desperate fathers; there were bitter-tongued mothers (O God! what
wonder!); there were reckless children; the very closest bonds of
nature were snapt in that time of trial and distress. There was Faith
such as the rich can never imagine on earth; there was "Love strong
as death;" and self-denial, among rude, coarse men, akin to that
of Sir Philip Sidney's most glorious deed. The vices of the poor
sometimes astound us _here_; but when the secrets of all hearts shall
be made known, their virtues will astound us in far greater degree.
Of this I am certain.

As the cold bleak spring came on (spring, in name alone), and
consequently as trade continued dead, other mills shortened hours,
turned off hands, and finally stopped work altogether.

Barton worked short hours; Wilson, of course, being a hand in
Carsons' factory, had no work at all. But his son, working at an
engineer's, and a steady man, obtained wages enough to maintain all
the family in a careful way. Still it preyed on Wilson's mind to be
so long indebted to his son. He was out of spirits and depressed.
Barton was morose, and soured towards mankind as a body, and the
rich in particular. One evening, when the clear light at six o'clock
contrasted strangely with the Christmas cold, and when the bitter
wind piped down every entry, and through every cranny, Barton sat
brooding over his stinted fire, and listening for Mary's step, in
unacknowledged trust that her presence would cheer him. The door was
opened, and Wilson came breathless in.

"You've not got a bit o' money by you, Barton?" asked he.

"Not I; who has now, I'd like to know. Whatten you want it for?"

"I donnot [11] want it for mysel, tho' we've none to spare. But don
ye know Ben Davenport as worked at Carsons'? He's down wi' the fever,
and ne'er a stick o' fire, nor a cowd [12] potato in the house."


   [Footnote 11: "Don" is constantly used in Lancashire for "do;"
                 as it was by our older writers. "And that may
                 non Hors _don_."--_Sir J. Mondeville._ "But for
                 th' entent to _don_ this sinne."--_Chaucer._]

   [Footnote 12: "Cowd," cold. Teut., _kaud_. Dutch, _koud_.]


"I han got no money, I tell ye," said Barton. Wilson looked
disappointed. Barton tried not to be interested, but he could not
help it in spite of his gruffness. He rose, and went to the cupboard
(his wife's pride long ago). There lay the remains of his dinner,
hastily put by ready for supper. Bread, and a slice of cold fat
boiled bacon. He wrapped them in his handkerchief, put them in the
crown of his hat, and said--"Come, let's be going."

"Going--art thou going to work this time o' day?"

"No, stupid, to be sure not. Going to see the fellow thou spoke
on." So they put on their hats and set out. On the way Wilson said
Davenport was a good fellow, though too much of the Methodee; that
his children were too young to work, but not too young to be cold and
hungry; that they had sunk lower and lower, and pawned thing after
thing, and that now they lived in a cellar in Berry Street, off Store
Street. Barton growled inarticulate words of no benevolent import to
a large class of mankind, and so they went along till they arrived
in Berry Street. It was unpaved; and down the middle a gutter forced
its way, every now and then forming pools in the holes with which the
street abounded. Never was the Old Edinburgh cry of "Gardez l'eau"
more necessary than in this street. As they passed, women from their
doors tossed household slops of _every_ description into the gutter;
they ran into the next pool, which overflowed and stagnated. Heaps of
ashes were the stepping-stones, on which the passer-by, who cared in
the least for cleanliness, took care not to put his foot. Our friends
were not dainty, but even they picked their way till they got to some
steps leading down into a small area, where a person standing would
have his head about one foot below the level of the street, and
might at the same time, without the least motion of his body, touch
the window of the cellar and the damp muddy wall right opposite.
You went down one step even from the foul area into the cellar in
which a family of human beings lived. It was very dark inside. The
window-panes were, many of them, broken and stuffed with rags, which
was reason enough for the dusky light that pervaded the place even at
mid-day. After the account I have given of the state of the street,
no one can be surprised that on going into the cellar inhabited by
Davenport, the smell was so foetid as almost to knock the two men
down. Quickly recovering themselves, as those inured to such things
do, they began to penetrate the thick darkness of the place, and to
see three or four little children rolling on the damp, nay wet, brick
floor, through which the stagnant, filthy moisture of the street
oozed up; the fire-place was empty and black; the wife sat on her
husband's lair, and cried in the dank loneliness.

"See, missis, I'm back again.--Hold your noise, children, and don't
mither [13] your mammy for bread; here's a chap as has got some for
you."


   [Footnote 13: "Mither," to trouble and perplex. "I'm welly
                 mithered"--I'm well nigh crazed.]


In that dim light, which was darkness to strangers, they clustered
round Barton, and tore from him the food he had brought with him. It
was a large hunch of bread, but it vanished in an instant.

"We mun do summut for 'em," said he to Wilson. "Yo stop here, and
I'll be back in half-an-hour."

So he strode, and ran, and hurried home. He emptied into the
ever-useful pocket-handkerchief the little meal remaining in the mug.
Mary would have her tea at Miss Simmonds'; her food for the day was
safe. Then he went up-stairs for his better coat, and his one, gay,
red-and-yellow silk pocket-handkerchief--his jewels, his plate, his
valuables, these were. He went to the pawn-shop; he pawned them for
five shillings; he stopped not, nor stayed, till he was once more
in London Road, within five minutes' walk of Berry Street--then he
loitered in his gait, in order to discover the shops he wanted. He
bought meat, and a loaf of bread, candles, chips, and from a little
retail yard he purchased a couple of hundredweights of coals. Some
money yet remained--all destined for them, but he did not yet know
how best to spend it. Food, light, and warmth, he had instantly seen
were necessary; for luxuries he would wait. Wilson's eyes filled with
tears when he saw Barton enter with his purchases. He understood
it all, and longed to be once more in work, that he might help in
some of these material ways, without feeling that he was using his
son's money. But though "silver and gold he had none," he gave
heart-service and love works of far more value. Nor was John Barton
behind in these. "The fever" was (as it usually is in Manchester) of
a low, putrid, typhoid kind; brought on by miserable living, filthy
neighbourhood, and great depression of mind and body. It is virulent,
malignant, and highly infectious. But the poor are fatalists with
regard to infection; and well for them it is so, for in their crowded
dwellings no invalid can be isolated. Wilson asked Barton if he
thought he should catch it, and was laughed at for his idea.

The two men, rough, tender nurses as they were, lighted the fire,
which smoked and puffed into the room as if it did not know the way
up the damp, unused chimney. The very smoke seemed purifying and
healthy in the thick clammy air. The children clamoured again for
bread; but this time Barton took a piece first to the poor, helpless,
hopeless woman, who still sat by the side of her husband, listening
to his anxious miserable mutterings. She took the bread, when it was
put into her hand, and broke a bit, but could not eat. She was past
hunger. She fell down on the floor with a heavy unresisting bang. The
men looked puzzled. "She's well-nigh clemmed," said Barton. "Folk
do say one mustn't give clemmed people much to eat; but, bless us,
she'll eat nought."

"I'll tell yo what I'll do," said Wilson. "I'll take these two big
lads, as does nought but fight, home to my missis's for to-night,
and I'll get a jug o' tea. Them women always does best with tea and
such-like slop."

So Barton was now left alone with a little child, crying (when it had
done eating) for mammy; with a fainting, dead-like woman; and with
the sick man, whose mutterings were rising up to screams and shrieks
of agonised anxiety. He carried the woman to the fire, and chafed her
hands. He looked around for something to raise her head. There was
literally nothing but some loose bricks. However, those he got; and
taking off his coat he covered them with it as well as he could. He
pulled her feet to the fire, which now began to emit some faint heat.
He looked round for water, but the poor woman had been too weak to
drag herself out to the distant pump, and water there was none. He
snatched the child, and ran up the area-steps to the room above, and
borrowed their only saucepan with some water in it. Then he began,
with the useful skill of a working-man, to make some gruel; and when
it was hastily made he seized a battered iron table-spoon (kept when
many other little things had been sold in a lot), in order to feed
baby, and with it he forced one or two drops between her clenched
teeth. The mouth opened mechanically to receive more, and gradually
she revived. She sat up and looked round; and recollecting all, fell
down again in weak and passive despair. Her little child crawled to
her, and wiped with its fingers the thick-coming tears which she
now had strength to weep. It was now high time to attend to the man.
He lay on straw, so damp and mouldy no dog would have chosen it in
preference to flags; over it was a piece of sacking, coming next to
his worn skeleton of a body; above him was mustered every article
of clothing that could be spared by mother or children this bitter
weather; and in addition to his own, these might have given as much
warmth as one blanket, could they have been kept on him; but as he
restlessly tossed to and fro, they fell off and left him shivering in
spite of the burning heat of his skin. Every now and then he started
up in his naked madness, looking like the prophet of woe in the
fearful plague-picture; but he soon fell again in exhaustion, and
Barton found he must be closely watched, lest in these falls he
should injure himself against the hard brick floor. He was thankful
when Wilson re-appeared, carrying in both hands a jug of steaming
tea, intended for the poor wife; but when the delirious husband saw
drink, he snatched at it with animal instinct, with a selfishness he
had never shown in health.

Then the two men consulted together. It seemed decided, without a
word being spoken on the subject, that both should spend the night
with the forlorn couple; that was settled. But could no doctor be
had? In all probability, no; the next day an infirmary order might be
begged, but meanwhile the only medical advice they could have must be
from a druggist's. So Barton (being the moneyed man) set out to find
a shop in London Road.

It is a pretty sight to walk through a street with lighted shops; the
gas is so brilliant, the display of goods so much more vividly shown
than by day, and of all shops a druggist's looks the most like the
tales of our childhood, from Aladdin's garden of enchanted fruits
to the charming Rosamond with her purple jar. No such associations
had Barton; yet he felt the contrast between the well-filled,
well-lighted shops and the dim gloomy cellar, and it made him moody
that such contrasts should exist. They are the mysterious problem of
life to more than him. He wondered if any in all the hurrying crowd
had come from such a house of mourning. He thought they all looked
joyous, and he was angry with them. But he could not, you cannot,
read the lot of those who daily pass you by in the street. How do you
know the wild romances of their lives; the trials, the temptations
they are even now enduring, resisting, sinking under? You may be
elbowed one instant by the girl desperate in her abandonment,
laughing in mad merriment with her outward gesture, while her soul
is longing for the rest of the dead, and bringing itself to think
of the cold-flowing river as the only mercy of God remaining to her
here. You may pass the criminal, meditating crimes at which you will
to-morrow shudder with horror as you read them. You may push against
one, humble and unnoticed, the last upon earth, who in Heaven will
for ever be in the immediate light of God's countenance. Errands of
mercy--errands of sin--did you ever think where all the thousands of
people you daily meet are bound? Barton's was an errand of mercy; but
the thoughts of his heart were touched by sin, by bitter hatred of
the happy, whom he, for the time, confounded with the selfish.

He reached a druggist's shop, and entered. The druggist (whose smooth
manners seemed to have been salved over with his own spermaceti)
listened attentively to Barton's description of Davenport's illness;
concluded it was typhus fever, very prevalent in that neighbourhood;
and proceeded to make up a bottle of medicine, sweet spirits of
nitre, or some such innocent potion, very good for slight colds, but
utterly powerless to stop, for an instant, the raging fever of the
poor man it was intended to relieve. He recommended the same course
they had previously determined to adopt, applying the next morning
for an infirmary order; and Barton left the shop with comfortable
faith in the physic given him; for men of his class, if they
believe in physic at all, believe that every description is equally
efficacious.

Meanwhile, Wilson had done what he could at Davenport's home. He
had soothed, and covered the man many a time; he had fed and hushed
the little child, and spoken tenderly to the woman, who lay still
in her weakness and her weariness. He had opened a door, but only
for an instant; it led into a back cellar, with a grating instead
of a window, down which dropped the moisture from pigsties, and
worse abominations. It was not paved; the floor was one mass of bad
smelling mud. It had never been used, for there was not an article of
furniture in it; nor could a human being, much less a pig, have lived
there many days. Yet the "back apartment" made a difference in the
rent. The Davenports paid threepence more for having two rooms. When
he turned round again, he saw the woman suckling the child from her
dry, withered breast.

"Surely the lad is weaned!" exclaimed he, in surprise. "Why, how old
is he?"

"Going on two year," she faintly answered. "But, oh! it keeps him
quiet when I've nought else to gi' him, and he'll get a bit of sleep
lying there, if he's getten [14] nought beside. We han done our best
to gi' the childer [15] food, howe'er we pinched ourselves."


   [Footnote 14: "For he had _geten_ him yet no benefice."--_Prologue
                 to Canterbury Tales._]

   [Footnote 15: Wicklife uses "_childre_" in his Apology, page 26.]


"Han [16] ye had no money fra th' town?"


   [Footnote 16: "What concord _han_ light and dark."--_Spenser._]


"No; my master is Buckinghamshire born; and he's feared the town
would send him back to his parish, if he went to th' board; so we've
just borne on in hope o' better times. But I think they'll never come
in my day;" and the poor woman began her weak high-pitched cry again.

"Here, sup [17] this drop o' gruel, and then try and get a bit o'
sleep. John and I'll watch by your master to-night."


   [Footnote 17: "And thay _soupe_ the brothe thereof."--_Sir J.
                 Mandeville._]


"God's blessing be on you!"

She finished the gruel, and fell into a deep sleep. Wilson covered
her with his coat as well as he could, and tried to move lightly
for fear of disturbing her; but there need have been no such dread,
for her sleep was profound and heavy with exhaustion. Once only she
roused to pull the coat round her little child.

And now all Wilson's care, and Barton's to boot, was wanted to
restrain the wild mad agony of the fevered man. He started up, he
yelled, he seemed infuriated by overwhelming anxiety. He cursed and
swore, which surprised Wilson, who knew his piety in health, and who
did not know the unbridled tongue of delirium. At length he seemed
exhausted, and fell asleep; and Barton and Wilson drew near the fire,
and talked together in whispers. They sat on the floor, for chairs
there were none; the sole table was an old tub turned upside-down.
They put out the candle and conversed by the flickering fire-light.

"Han yo known this chap long?" asked Barton.

"Better nor three year. He's worked wi' Carsons that long, and
were alway a steady, civil-spoken fellow, though, as I said afore,
somewhat of a Methodee. I wish I'd gotten a letter he sent his
missis, a week or two agone, when he were on tramp for work. It did
my heart good to read it; for, yo see, I were a bit grumbling mysel;
it seemed hard to be spunging on Jem, and taking a' his flesh-meat
money to buy bread for me and them as I ought to be keeping. But, yo
know, though I can earn nought, I mun eat summut. Well, as I telled
ye, I were grumbling, when she (indicating the sleeping woman by a
nod) brought me Ben's letter, for she could na read hersel. It were
as good as Bible-words; ne'er a word o' repining; a' about God being
our Father, and that we mun bear patiently whate'er He sends."

"Don ye think He's th' masters' Father, too? I'd be loath to have 'em
for brothers."

"Eh, John! donna talk so; sure there's many and many a master as good
or better nor us."

"If you think so, tell me this. How comes it they're rich, and we're
poor? I'd like to know that. Han they done as they'd be done by for
us?"

But Wilson was no arguer; no speechifier as he would have called it.
So Barton, seeing he was likely to have it his own way, went on.

"You'll say (at least many a one does), they'n [18] getten capital
an' we'n getten none. I say, our labour's our capital and we ought
to draw interest on that. They get interest on their capital somehow
a' this time, while ourn is lying idle, else how could they all live
as they do? Besides, there's many on 'em as had nought to begin wi';
there's Carsons, and Duncombes, and Mengies, and many another, as
comed into Manchester with clothes to their back, and that were all,
and now they're worth their tens of thousands, a' getten out of
our labour; why the very land as fetched but sixty pound twenty
year agone is now worth six hundred, and that, too, is owing to
our labour: but look at yo, and see me, and poor Davenport yonder;
whatten better are we? They'n screwed us down to th' lowest peg, in
order to make their great big fortunes, and build their great big
houses, and we, why we're just clemming, many and many of us. Can you
say there's nought wrong in this?"


   [Footnote 18: "They'n," contraction of "they han," they have.]


"Well, Barton, I'll not gainsay ye. But Mr. Carson spoke to me after
th' fire, and says he, 'I shall ha' to retrench, and be very careful
in my expenditure during these bad times, I assure ye;' so yo see th'
masters suffer too."

"Han they ever seen a child o' their'n die for want o' food?" asked
Barton, in a low, deep voice.

"I donnot mean," continued he, "to say as I'm so badly off. I'd
scorn to speak for mysel; but when I see such men as Davenport there
dying away, for very clemming, I cannot stand it. I've but gotten
Mary, and she keeps hersel pretty much. I think we'll ha' to give up
house-keeping; but that I donnot mind."

And in this kind of talk the night, the long heavy night of watching,
wore away. As far as they could judge, Davenport continued in the
same state, although the symptoms varied occasionally. The wife slept
on, only roused by a cry of her child now and then, which seemed to
have power over her, when far louder noises failed to disturb her.
The watchers agreed, that as soon as it was likely Mr. Carson would
be up and visible, Wilson should go to his house, and beg for an
Infirmary order. At length the gray dawn penetrated even into the
dark cellar. Davenport slept, and Barton was to remain there until
Wilson's return; so stepping out into the fresh air, brisk and
reviving, even in that street of abominations, Wilson took his way to
Mr. Carson's.

Wilson had about two miles to walk before he reached Mr. Carson's
house, which was almost in the country. The streets were not yet
bustling and busy. The shopmen were lazily taking down the shutters,
although it was near eight o'clock; for the day was long enough for
the purchases people made in that quarter of the town, while trade
was so flat. One or two miserable-looking women were setting off on
their day's begging expedition. But there were few people abroad. Mr.
Carson's was a good house, and furnished with disregard to expense.
But in addition to lavish expenditure, there was much taste shown,
and many articles chosen for their beauty and elegance adorned
his rooms. As Wilson passed a window which a housemaid had thrown
open, he saw pictures and gilding, at which he was tempted to stop
and look; but then he thought it would not be respectful. So he
hastened on to the kitchen door. The servants seemed very busy with
preparations for breakfast; but good-naturedly, though hastily,
told him to step in, and they could soon let Mr. Carson know he was
there. So he was ushered into a kitchen hung round with glittering
tins, where a roaring fire burnt merrily, and where numbers of
utensils hung round, at whose nature and use Wilson amused himself
by guessing. Meanwhile, the servants bustled to and fro; an out-door
man-servant came in for orders, and sat down near Wilson; the cook
broiled steaks, and the kitchen-maid toasted bread, and boiled eggs.

The coffee steamed upon the fire, and altogether the odours were so
mixed and appetising, that Wilson began to yearn for food to break
his fast, which had lasted since dinner the day before. If the
servants had known this, they would have willingly given him meat
and bread in abundance; but they were like the rest of us, and not
feeling hunger themselves, forgot it was possible another might. So
Wilson's craving turned to sickness, while they chattered on, making
the kitchen's free and keen remarks upon the parlour.

"How late you were last night, Thomas!"

"Yes, I was right weary of waiting; they told me to be at the rooms
by twelve; and there I was. But it was two o'clock before they called
me."

"And did you wait all that time in the street?" asked the housemaid,
who had done her work for the present, and come into the kitchen for
a bit of gossip.

"My eye as like! you don't think I'm such a fool as to catch my death
of cold, and let the horses catch their death too, as we should ha'
done if we'd stopped there. No! I put th' horses up in th' stables at
th' Spread Eagle, and went mysel, and got a glass or two by th' fire.
They're driving a good custom, them, wi' coachmen. There were five on
us, and we'd many a quart o' ale, and gin wi' it, to keep out cold."

"Mercy on us, Thomas; you'll get a drunkard at last!"

"If I do, I know whose blame it will be. It will be missis's, and
not mine. Flesh and blood can't sit to be starved to death on a
coach-box, waiting for folks as don't know their own mind."

A servant, semi-upper-housemaid, semi-lady's-maid, now came down with
orders from her mistress.

"Thomas, you must ride to the fishmonger's, and say missis can't give
above half-a-crown a pound for salmon for Tuesday; she's grumbling
because trade's so bad. And she'll want the carriage at three to go
to the lecture, Thomas; at the Royal Execution, you know."

"Ay, ay, I know."

"And you'd better all of you mind your P's and Q's, for she's very
black this morning. She's got a bad headache."

"It's a pity Miss Jenkins is not here to match her. Lord! how she and
missis did quarrel which had got the worst headaches; it was that
Miss Jenkins left for; she would not give up having bad headaches,
and missis could not abide any one to have 'em but herself."

"Missis will have her breakfast up-stairs, cook, and the cold
partridge as was left yesterday, and put plenty of cream in her
coffee, and she thinks there's a roll left, and she would like it
well buttered."

So saying, the maid left the kitchen to be ready to attend to the
young ladies' bell when they chose to ring, after their late assembly
the night before.

In the luxurious library, at the well-spread breakfast-table, sat
the two Mr. Carsons, father and son. Both were reading; the father
a newspaper, the son a review, while they lazily enjoyed their
nicely prepared food. The father was a prepossessing-looking old
man; perhaps self-indulgent you might guess. The son was strikingly
handsome, and knew it. His dress was neat and well appointed, and his
manners far more gentlemanly than his father's. He was the only son,
and his sisters were proud of him; his father and mother were proud
of him: he could not set up his judgment against theirs; he was proud
of himself.

The door opened and in bounded Amy, the sweet youngest daughter of
the house, a lovely girl of sixteen, fresh and glowing, and bright
as a rosebud. She was too young to go to assemblies, at which her
father rejoiced, for he had little Amy with her pretty jokes, and her
bird-like songs, and her playful caresses all the evening to amuse
him in his loneliness; and she was not too much tired, like Sophy and
Helen, to give him her sweet company at breakfast the next morning.

He submitted willingly while she blinded him with her hands, and
kissed his rough red face all over. She took his newspaper away after
a little pretended resistance, and would not allow her brother Harry
to go on with his review.

"I'm the only lady this morning, papa, so you know you must make a
great deal of me."

"My darling, I think you have your own way always, whether you're the
only lady or not."

"Yes, papa, you're pretty good and obedient, I must say that; but I'm
sorry to say Harry is very naughty, and does not do what I tell him;
do you, Harry?"

"I'm sure I don't know what you mean to accuse me of, Amy; I expected
praise and not blame; for did not I get you that eau de Portugal from
town, that you could not meet with at Hughes', you little ungrateful
puss?"

"Did you! Oh, sweet Harry; you're as sweet as eau de Portugal
yourself; you're almost as good as papa; but still you know you did
go and forget to ask Bigland for that rose, that new rose they say he
has got."

"No, Amy, I did not forget. I asked him, and he has got the Rose,
_sans reproche_; but do you know, little Miss Extravagance, a very
small one is half-a-guinea?"

"Oh, I don't mind. Papa will give it me, won't you, dear father? He
knows his little daughter can't live without flowers and scents."

Mr. Carson tried to refuse his darling, but she coaxed him into
acquiescence, saying she must have it, it was one of her necessaries.
Life was not worth having without flowers.

"Then, Amy," said her brother, "try and be content with peonies and
dandelions."

"Oh, you wretch! I don't call them flowers. Besides, you're every bit
as extravagant. Who gave half-a-crown for a bunch of lilies of the
valley at Yates', a month ago, and then would not let his poor little
sister have them, though she went on her knees to beg them? Answer me
that, Master Hal."

"Not on compulsion," replied her brother, smiling with his mouth,
while his eyes had an irritated expression, and he went first red,
then pale, with vexed embarrassment.

"If you please, sir," said a servant, entering the room, "here's one
of the mill people wanting to see you; his name is Wilson, he says."

"I'll come to him directly; stay, tell him to come in here."

Amy danced off into the conservatory which opened out of the room,
before the gaunt, pale, unwashed, unshaven weaver was ushered in.
There he stood at the door, sleeking his hair with old country habit,
and every now and then stealing a glance round at the splendour of
the apartment.

"Well, Wilson, and what do you want to-day, man?"

"Please, sir, Davenport's ill of the fever, and I'm come to know if
you've got an Infirmary order for him?"

"Davenport--Davenport; who is the fellow? I don't know the name."

"He's worked in your factory better nor three year, sir."

"Very likely; I don't pretend to know the names of the men I employ;
that I leave to the overlooker. So he's ill, eh?"

"Ay, sir, he's very bad; we want to get him in at the fever wards.

"I doubt if I have an in-patient's order to spare; they're always
wanted for accidents, you know. But I'll give you an out-patient's,
and welcome."

So saying, he rose up, unlocked a drawer, pondered a minute, and then
gave Wilson an out-patient's order to be presented the following
Monday. Monday! How many days there were before Monday!

Meanwhile, the younger Mr. Carson had ended his review, and began to
listen to what was going on. He finished his breakfast, got up, and
pulled five shillings out of his pocket, which he gave to Wilson
as he passed him, for the "poor fellow." He went past quickly, and
calling for his horse, mounted gaily, and rode away. He was anxious
to be in time to have a look and a smile from lovely Mary Barton, as
she went to Miss Simmonds'. But to-day he was to be disappointed.
Wilson left the house, not knowing whether to be pleased or grieved.
It was long to Monday, but they had all spoken kindly to him, and who
could tell if they might not remember this, and do something before
Monday. Besides, the cook, who, when she had had time to think, after
breakfast was sent in, had noticed his paleness, had had meat and
bread ready to put in his hand when he came out of the parlour; and a
full stomach makes every one of us more hopeful.

When he reached Berry Street, he had persuaded himself he bore good
news, and felt almost elated in his heart. But it fell when he opened
the cellar-door, and saw Barton and the wife both bending over the
sick man's couch with awe-struck, saddened look.

"Come here," said Barton. "There's a change comed over him sin' yo
left, is there not?"

Wilson looked. The flesh was sunk, the features prominent, bony, and
rigid. The fearful clay-colour of death was over all. But the eyes
were open and sensible, though the films of the grave were settling
upon them.

"He wakened fra his sleep, as yo left him in, and began to mutter and
moan; but he soon went off again, and we never knew he were awake
till he called his wife, but now she's here he's gotten nought to say
to her."

Most probably, as they all felt, he could not speak, for his strength
was fast ebbing. They stood round him still and silent; even the wife
checked her sobs, though her heart was like to break. She held her
child to her breast, to try and keep him quiet. Their eyes were all
fixed on the yet living one, whose moments of life were passing so
rapidly away. At length he brought (with jerking, convulsive effort)
his two hands into the attitude of prayer. They saw his lips move,
and bent to catch the words, which came in gasps, and not in tones.

"Oh Lord God! I thank thee, that the hard struggle of living is
over."

"Oh, Ben! Ben!" wailed forth his wife, "have you no thought for me?
Oh, Ben! Ben! do say one word to help me through life."

He could not speak again. The trump of the archangel would set his
tongue free; but not a word more would it utter till then. Yet he
heard, he understood, and though sight failed, he moved his hand
gropingly over the covering. They knew what he meant, and guided it
to her head, bowed and hidden in her hands, when she had sunk in her
woe. It rested there, with a feeble pressure of endearment. The face
grew beautiful, as the soul neared God. A peace beyond understanding
came over it. The hand was a heavy, stiff weight on the wife's
head. No more grief or sorrow for him. They reverently laid out the
corpse--Wilson fetching his only spare shirt to array it in. The wife
still lay hidden in the clothes, in a stupor of agony.

There was a knock at the door, and Barton went to open it. It
was Mary, who had received a message from her father, through a
neighbour, telling her where he was; and she had set out early to
come and have a word with him before her day's work; but some errands
she had to do for Miss Simmonds had detained her until now.

"Come in, wench!" said her father. "Try if thou canst comfort yon
poor, poor woman, kneeling down there. God help her." Mary did not
know what to say, or how to comfort; but she knelt down by her, and
put her arm round her neck, and in a little while fell to crying
herself so bitterly, that the source of tears was opened by sympathy
in the widow, and her full heart was, for a time, relieved.

And Mary forgot all purposed meeting with her gay lover, Harry
Carson; forgot Miss Simmonds' errands, and her anger, in the anxious
desire to comfort the poor lone woman. Never had her sweet face
looked more angelic, never had her gentle voice seemed so musical as
when she murmured her broken sentences of comfort.

"Oh, don't cry so, dear Mrs. Davenport, pray don't take on so. Sure
he's gone where he'll never know care again. Yes, I know how lonesome
you must feel; but think of your children. Oh! we'll all help to earn
food for 'em. Think how sorry _he'd_ be, if he sees you fretting so.
Don't cry so, please don't."

And she ended by crying herself, as passionately as the poor widow.

It was agreed that the town must bury him; he had paid to a burial
club as long as he could; but by a few weeks' omission, he had
forfeited his claim to a sum of money now. Would Mrs. Davenport and
the little child go home with Mary? The latter brightened up as she
urged this plan; but no! where the poor, fondly loved remains were,
there would the mourner be; and all that they could do was to make
her as comfortable as their funds would allow, and to beg a neighbour
to look in and say a word at times. So she was left alone with her
dead, and they went to work that had work, and he who had none, took
upon him the arrangements for the funeral.

Mary had many a scolding from Miss Simmonds that day for her absence
of mind. To be sure Miss Simmonds was much put out by Mary's
non-appearance in the morning with certain bits of muslin, and shades
of silk which were wanted to complete a dress to be worn that night;
but it was true enough that Mary did not mind what she was about;
she was too busy planning how her old black gown (her best when
her mother died) might be spunged, and turned, and lengthened into
something like decent mourning for the widow. And when she went home
at night (though it was very late, as a sort of retribution for her
morning's negligence), she set to work at once, and was so busy, and
so glad over her task, that she had, every now and then, to check
herself in singing merry ditties, that she felt little accorded with
the sewing on which she was engaged.

So when the funeral day came, Mrs. Davenport was neatly arrayed in
black, a satisfaction to her poor heart in the midst of her sorrow.
Barton and Wilson both accompanied her, as she led her two elder
boys, and followed the coffin. It was a simple walking funeral, with
nothing to grate on the feelings of any; far more in accordance with
its purpose, to my mind, than the gorgeous hearses, and nodding
plumes, which form the grotesque funeral pomp of respectable people.
There was no "rattling the bones over the stones," of the pauper's
funeral. Decently and quietly was he followed to the grave by one
determined to endure her woe meekly for his sake. The only mark of
pauperism attendant on the burial concerned the living and joyous,
far more than the dead, or the sorrowful. When they arrived in the
churchyard, they halted before a raised and handsome tombstone; in
reality a wooden mockery of stone respectabilities which adorned the
burial-ground. It was easily raised in a very few minutes, and below
was the grave in which pauper bodies were piled until within a foot
or two of the surface; when the soil was shovelled over, and stamped
down, and the wooden cover went to do temporary duty over another
hole. [19] But little they recked of this who now gave up their dead.

                 churchyard in Manchester. There may be more.]




CHAPTER VII.

JEM WILSON'S REPULSE.


   "How infinite the wealth of love and hope
   Garnered in these same tiny treasure-houses!
   And oh! what bankrupts in the world we feel,
   When Death, like some remorseless creditor,
   Seizes on all we fondly thought our own!"

   "THE TWINS."


The ghoul-like fever was not to be braved with impunity, and baulked
of its prey. The widow had reclaimed her children; her neighbours,
in the good Samaritan sense of the word, had paid her little arrears
of rent, and made her a few shillings beforehand with the world.
She determined to flit from that cellar to another less full of
painful associations, less haunted by mournful memories. The board,
not so formidable as she had imagined, had inquired into her case;
and, instead of sending her to Stoke Claypole, her husband's
Buckinghamshire parish, as she had dreaded, had agreed to pay her
rent. So food for four mouths was all she was now required to find;
only for three she would have said; for herself and the unweaned
child were but reckoned as one in her calculation.

She had a strong heart, now her bodily strength had been recruited by
a week or two of food, and she would not despair. So she took in some
little children to nurse, who brought their daily food with them,
which she cooked for them, without wronging their helplessness of a
crumb; and when she had restored them to their mothers at night, she
set to work at plain sewing, "seam, and gusset, and band," and sat
thinking how she might best cheat the factory inspector, and persuade
him that her strong, big, hungry Ben was above thirteen. Her plan of
living was so far arranged, when she heard, with keen sorrow, that
Wilson's twin lads were ill of the fever.

They had never been strong. They were like many a pair of twins,
and seemed to have but one life divided between them. One life, one
strength, and in this instance, I might almost say, one brain; for
they were helpless, gentle, silly children, but not the less dear
to their parents and to their strong, active, manly, elder brother.
They were late on their feet, late in talking, late every way; had to
be nursed and cared for when other lads of their age were tumbling
about in the street, and losing themselves, and being taken to the
police-office miles away from home.

Still want had never yet come in at the door to make love for these
innocents fly out at the window. Nor was this the case even now, when
Jem Wilson's earnings, and his mother's occasional charrings were
barely sufficient to give all the family their fill of food.

But when the twins, after ailing many days, and caring little for
their meat, fell sick on the same afternoon, with the same heavy
stupor of suffering, the three hearts that loved them so, each felt,
though none acknowledged to the other, that they had little chance
for life. It was nearly a week before the tale of their illness
spread as far as the court where the Wilsons had once dwelt, and the
Bartons yet lived.

Alice had heard of the illness of her little nephews several days
before, and had locked her cellar door, and gone off straight to her
brother's house, in Ancoats; but she was often absent for days, sent
for, as her neighbours knew, to help in some sudden emergency of
illness or distress, so that occasioned no surprise.

Margaret met Jem Wilson several days after his brothers were
seriously ill, and heard from him the state of things at his home.
She told Mary of it as she entered the court late that evening; and
Mary listened with saddened heart to the strange contrast which such
woeful tidings presented to the gay and loving words she had been
hearing on her walk home. She blamed herself for being so much taken
up with visions of the golden future, that she had lately gone but
seldom on Sunday afternoons, or other leisure time, to see Mrs.
Wilson, her mother's friend; and with hasty purpose of amendment she
only stayed to leave a message for her father with the next-door
neighbour, and then went off at a brisk pace on her way to the house
of mourning.

She stopped with her hand on the latch of the Wilsons' door, to
still her beating heart, and listened to the hushed quiet within.
She opened the door softly: there sat Mrs. Wilson in the old
rocking-chair, with one sick, death-like boy lying on her knee,
crying without let or pause, but softly, gently, as fearing to
disturb the troubled, gasping child; while behind her, old Alice let
her fast-dropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other twin,
which she was laying out on a board, placed on a sort of sofa-settee
in a corner of the room. Over the child, which yet breathed, the
father bent, watching anxiously for some ground of hope, where hope
there was none. Mary stepped slowly and lightly across to Alice.

"Ay, poor lad! God has taken him early, Mary."

Mary could not speak; she did not know what to say; it was so much
worse than she expected. At last she ventured to whisper,

"Is there any chance for the other one, think you?"

Alice shook her head, and told with a look that she believed there
was none. She next endeavoured to lift the little body, and carry it
to its old accustomed bed in its parents' room. But earnest as the
father was in watching the yet-living, he had eyes and ears for all
that concerned the dead, and sprang gently up, and took his dead son
on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength, and carried him
upstairs as if afraid of wakening him.

The other child gasped longer, louder, with more of effort.

"We mun get him away from his mother. He cannot die while she's
wishing him."

"Wishing him?" said Mary, in a tone of inquiry.

"Ay; donno ye know what wishing means? There's none can die in the
arms of those who are wishing them sore to stay on earth. The soul o'
them as holds them won't let the dying soul go free; so it has a hard
struggle for the quiet of death. We mun get him away fra' his mother,
or he'll have a hard death, poor lile [20] fellow."


   [Footnote 20: "Lile," a north-country word for "little."
                 "Wit _leil_ labour to live."--_Piers Ploughman._]


So without circumlocution she went and offered to take the sinking
child. But the mother would not let him go, and looking in Alice's
face with brimming and imploring eyes, declared in earnest whispers,
that she was not wishing him, that she would fain have him released
from his suffering. Alice and Mary stood by with eyes fixed on the
poor child, whose struggles seemed to increase, till at last his
mother said with a choking voice,

"May happen [21] yo'd better take him, Alice; I believe my heart's
wishing him a' this while, for I cannot, no, I cannot bring mysel to
let my two childer go in one day; I cannot help longing to keep him,
and yet he sha'not suffer longer for me."


   [Footnote 21: "May happen," perhaps.]


She bent down, and fondly, oh! with what passionate fondness, kissed
her child, and then gave him up to Alice, who took him with tender
care. Nature's struggles were soon exhausted, and he breathed his
little life away in peace.

Then the mother lifted up her voice and wept. Her cries brought her
husband down to try with his aching heart to comfort hers. Again
Alice laid out the dead, Mary helping with reverent fear. The father
and mother carried him up-stairs to the bed, where his little brother
lay in calm repose.

Mary and Alice drew near the fire, and stood in quiet sorrow for some
time. Then Alice broke the silence by saying,

"It will be bad news for Jem, poor fellow, when he comes home."

"Where is he?" asked Mary.

"Working over-hours at th' shop. They'n getten a large order fra'
forrin parts; and yo' know, Jem mun work, though his heart's
well-nigh breaking for these poor laddies."

Again they were silent in thought, and again Alice spoke first.

"I sometimes think the Lord is against planning. Whene'er I plan
over-much, He is sure to send and mar all my plans, as if He would
ha' me put the future into His hands. Afore Christmas-time I was as
full as full could be, of going home for good and all; yo' han heard
how I've wished it this terrible long time. And a young lass from
behind Burton came into place in Manchester last Martinmas; so after
awhile, she had a Sunday out, and she comes to me, and tells me some
cousins o' mine bid her find me out, and say how glad they should be
to ha' me to bide wi' 'em, and look after th' childer, for they'n
getten a big farm, and she's a deal to do among th' cows. So many
a winter's night did I lie awake and think, that please God, come
summer, I'd bid George and his wife good bye, and go home at last.
Little did I think how God Almighty would baulk me, for not leaving
my days in His hands, who had led me through the wilderness hitherto.
Here's George out o' work, and more cast down than ever I seed him;
wanting every chip o' comfort he can get, e'en afore this last heavy
stroke; and now I'm thinking the Lord's finger points very clear to
my fit abiding place; and I'm sure if George and Jane can say 'His
will be done,' it's no more than what I'm beholden to do."

So saying, she fell to tidying the room, removing as much as she
could every vestige of sickness; making up the fire, and setting on
the kettle for a cup of tea for her sister-in-law, whose low moans
and sobs were occasionally heard in the room below.

Mary helped her in all these little offices. They were busy in this
way when the door was softly opened, and Jem came in, all grimed and
dirty from his night-work, his soiled apron wrapped round his middle,
in guise and apparel in which he would have been sorry at another
time to have been seen by Mary. But just now he hardly saw her; he
went straight up to Alice, and asked how the little chaps were. They
had been a shade better at dinner-time, and he had been working away
through the long afternoon, and far into the night, in the belief
that they had taken the turn. He had stolen out during the half-hour
allowed at the works for tea, to buy them an orange or two, which now
puffed out his jacket-pocket.

He would make his aunt speak; he would not understand her shakes of
the head and fast coursing tears.

"They're both gone," said she.

"Dead!"

"Ay! poor fellows. They took worse about two o'clock. Joe went first,
as easy as a lamb, and Will died harder like."

"Both!"

"Ay, lad! both. The Lord has ta'en them from some evil to come, or He
would na ha' made choice o' them. Ye may rest sure o' that."

Jem went to the cupboard, and quietly extricated from his pocket
the oranges he had bought. But he stayed long there, and at last
his sturdy frame shook with his strong agony. The two women were
frightened, as women always are, on witnessing a man's overpowering
grief. They cried afresh in company. Mary's heart melted within her
as she witnessed Jem's sorrow, and she stepped gently up to the
corner where he stood, with his back turned to them, and putting her
hand softly on his arm, said,

"Oh, Jem, don't give way so; I cannot bear to see you."

Jem felt a strange leap of joy in his heart, and knew the power she
had of comforting him. He did not speak, as though fearing to destroy
by sound or motion the happiness of that moment, when her soft
hand's touch thrilled through his frame, and her silvery voice was
whispering tenderness in his ear. Yes! it might be very wrong; he
could almost hate himself for it; with death and woe so surrounding
him, it yet was happiness, was bliss, to be so spoken to by Mary.

"Don't, Jem, please don't," whispered she again, believing that his
silence was only another form of grief.

He could not contain himself. He took her hand in his firm yet
trembling grasp, and said, in tones that instantly produced a
revulsion in her mood,

"Mary, I almost loathe myself when I feel I would not give up this
minute, when my brothers lie dead, and father and mother are in such
trouble, for all my life that's past and gone. And, Mary (as she
tried to release her hand), you know what makes me feel so blessed."

She did know--he was right there. But as he turned to catch a look at
her sweet face, he saw that it expressed unfeigned distress, almost
amounting to vexation; a dread of him, that he thought was almost
repugnance.

He let her hand go, and she quickly went away to Alice's side.

"Fool that I was--nay, wretch that I was--to let myself take this
time of trouble to tell her how I loved her; no wonder that she turns
away from such a selfish beast."

Partly to relieve her from his presence, and partly from natural
desire, and partly, perhaps, from a penitent wish to share to the
utmost his parents' sorrow, he soon went up-stairs to the chamber of
death.

Mary mechanically helped Alice in all the duties she performed
through the remainder of that long night, but she did not see Jem
again. He remained up-stairs until after the early dawn showed Mary
that she need have no fear of going home through the deserted and
quiet streets, to try and get a little sleep before work hour. So
leaving kind messages to George and Jane Wilson, and hesitating
whether she might dare to send a few kind words to Jem, and deciding
that she had better not, she stepped out into the bright morning
light, so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been.

            "They had
   Another morn than ours."

Mary lay down on her bed in her clothes; and whether it was this, or
the broad daylight that poured in through the sky-window, or whether
it was over-excitement, it was long before she could catch a wink of
sleep. Her thoughts ran on Jem's manner and words; not but what she
had known the tale they told for many a day; but still she wished he
had not put it so plainly.

"Oh dear," said she to herself, "I wish he would not mistake me so; I
never dare to speak a common word o' kindness, but his eye brightens
and his cheek flushes. It's very hard on me; for father and George
Wilson are old friends; and Jem and I ha' known each other since we
were quite children. I cannot think what possesses me, that I must
always be wanting to comfort him when he's downcast, and that I must
go meddling wi' him to-night, when sure enough it was his aunt's
place to speak to him. I don't care for him, and yet, unless I'm
always watching myself, I'm speaking to him in a loving voice. I
think I cannot go right, for I either check myself till I'm downright
cross to him, or else I speak just natural, and that's too kind and
tender by half. And I'm as good as engaged to be married to another;
and another far handsomer than Jem; only I think I like Jem's face
best for all that; liking's liking, and there's no help for it. Well,
when I'm Mrs. Harry Carson, may happen I can put some good fortune in
Jem's way. But will he thank me for it? He's rather savage at times,
that I can see, and perhaps kindness from me, when I'm another's,
will only go against the grain. I'll not plague myself wi' thinking
any more about him, that I won't."

So she turned on her pillow, and fell asleep, and dreamt of what was
often in her waking thoughts; of the day when she should ride from
church in her carriage, with wedding-bells ringing, and take up
her astonished father, and drive away from the old dim work-a-day
court for ever, to live in a grand house, where her father should
have newspapers, and pamphlets, and pipes, and meat dinners every
day,--and all day long if he liked.

Such thoughts mingled in her predilection for the handsome young
Mr. Carson, who, unfettered by work-hours, let scarcely a day pass
without contriving a meeting with the beautiful little milliner he
had first seen while lounging in a shop where his sisters were making
some purchases, and afterwards never rested till he had freely,
though respectfully, made her acquaintance in her daily walks. He
was, to use his own expression to himself, quite infatuated by her,
and was restless each day till the time came when he had a chance,
and, of late, more than a chance of meeting her. There was something
of keen practical shrewdness about her, which contrasted very
bewitchingly with the simple, foolish, unworldly ideas she had picked
up from the romances which Miss Simmonds' young ladies were in the
habit of recommending to each other.

Yes! Mary was ambitious, and did not favour Mr. Carson the less
because he was rich and a gentleman. The old leaven, infused years
ago by her aunt Esther, fermented in her little bosom, and perhaps
all the more, for her father's aversion to the rich and the gentle.
Such is the contrariness of the human heart, from Eve downwards, that
we all, in our old-Adam state, fancy things forbidden sweetest. So
Mary dwelt upon and enjoyed the idea of some day becoming a lady, and
doing all the elegant nothings appertaining to ladyhood. It was a
comfort to her, when scolded by Miss Simmonds, to think of the day
when she would drive up to the door in her own carriage, to order her
gowns from the hasty tempered yet kind dressmaker. It was a pleasure
to her to hear the general admiration of the two elder Miss Carsons,
acknowledged beauties in ball-room and street, on horseback and on
foot, and to think of the time when she should ride and walk with
them in loving sisterhood. But the best of her plans, the holiest,
that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest, were
those relating to her father; her dear father, now oppressed with
care, and always a disheartened, gloomy person. How she would
surround him with every comfort she could devise (of course, he was
to live with them), till he should acknowledge riches to be very
pleasant things, and bless his lady-daughter! Every one who had shown
her kindness in her low estate should then be repaid a hundred-fold.

Such were the castles in air, the Alnaschar-visions in which Mary
indulged, and which she was doomed in after days to expiate with many
tears.

Meanwhile, her words--or, even more, her tones--would maintain their
hold on Jem Wilson's memory. A thrill would yet come over him when
he remembered how her hand had rested on his arm. The thought of her
mingled with all his grief, and it was profound, for the loss of his
brothers.




CHAPTER VIII.

MARGARET'S DEBUT AS A PUBLIC SINGER.


   "Deal gently with them, they have much endured.
   Scoff not at their fond hopes and earnest plans,
   Though they may seem to thee wild dreams and fancies.
   Perchance, in the rough school of stern experience,
   They've something learned which Theory does not teach;
   Or if they greatly err, deal gently still,
   And let their error but the stronger plead
   'Give us the light and guidance that we need!'"

   LOVE THOUGHTS.


One Sunday afternoon, about three weeks after that mournful night,
Jem Wilson set out with the ostensible purpose of calling on John
Barton. He was dressed in his best, his Sunday suit of course; while
his face glittered with the scrubbing he had bestowed on it. His dark
black hair had been arranged and re-arranged before the household
looking-glass, and in his button-hole he stuck a narcissus (a sweet
Nancy is its pretty Lancashire name), hoping it would attract Mary's
notice, so that he might have the delight of giving it her.

It was a bad beginning of his visit of happiness that Mary saw him
some minutes before he came into her father's house. She was sitting
at the end of the dresser, with the little window-blind drawn on one
side, in order that she might see the passers-by, in the intervals
of reading her Bible, which lay open before her. So she watched
all the greeting a friend gave Jem; she saw the face of condolence,
the sympathetic shake of the hand, and had time to arrange her own
face and manner before Jem came in, which he did, as if he had eyes
for no one but her father, who sat smoking his pipe by the fire,
while he read an old "Northern Star," borrowed from a neighbouring
public-house.

Then he turned to Mary, who, he felt by the sure instinct of love,
by which almost his body thought, was present. Her hands were busy
adjusting her dress; a forced and unnecessary movement Jem could not
help thinking. Her accost was quiet and friendly, if grave; she felt
that she reddened like a rose, and wished she could prevent it, while
Jem wondered if her blushes arose from fear, or anger, or love.

She was very cunning, I am afraid. She pretended to read diligently,
and not to listen to a word that was said, while, in fact, she heard
all sounds, even to Jem's long, deep sighs, which wrung her heart. At
last she took up her Bible, and as if their conversation disturbed
her, went up-stairs to her little room. And she had scarcely spoken
a word to Jem; scarcely looked at him; never noticed his beautiful
sweet Nancy, which only awaited her least word of praise to be hers!
He did not know--that pang was spared--that in her little dingy
bed-room, stood a white jug, filled with a luxuriant bunch of early
spring roses, making the whole room fragrant and bright. They were
the gift of her richer lover. So Jem had to go on sitting with John
Barton, fairly caught in his own trap, and had to listen to his talk,
and answer him as best he might.

"There's the right stuff in this here 'Star,' and no mistake. Such a
right-down piece for short hours."

"At the same rate of wages as now?" asked Jem.

"Ay, ay! else where's the use? It's only taking out o' the masters'
pocket what they can well afford. Did I ever tell yo what th'
Infirmary chap let me into, many a year agone?"

"No," said Jem, listlessly.

"Well! yo must know I were in th' Infirmary for a fever, and times
were rare and bad; and there be good chaps there to a man, while he's
wick, [22] whate'er they may be about cutting him up at after. [23]
So when I were better o' th' fever, but weak as water, they says to
me, says they, 'If yo can write, yo may stay in a week longer, and
help our surgeon wi' sorting his papers; and we'll take care yo've
your belly full o' meat and drink. Yo'll be twice as strong in a
week.' So there wanted but one word to that bargain. So I were set to
writing and copying; th' writing I could do well enough, but they'd
such queer ways o' spelling that I'd ne'er been used to, that I'd to
look first at th' copy and then at my letters, for all the world like
a cock picking up grains o' corn. But one thing startled me e'en
then, and I thought I'd make bold to ask the surgeon the meaning o't.
I've gotten no head for numbers, but this I know, that by _far th'
greater part o' th' accidents as comed in, happened in th' last two
hours o' work_, when folk getten tired and careless. Th' surgeon
said it were all true, and that he were going to bring that fact to
light."


   [Footnote 22: "Wick," alive. Anglo-Saxon, cwic. "The _quick_
                 and the dead."--_Book of Common Prayer._]

   [Footnote 23: "At after." "_At after souper goth this noble
                 king._" _Chaucer; The Squire's Tale._]


Jem was pondering Mary's conduct; but the pause made him aware he
ought to utter some civil listening noise; so he said

"Very true."

"Ay, it's true enough, my lad, that we're sadly over-borne, and worse
will come of it afore long. Block-printers is going to strike; they'n
getten a bang-up union, as won't let 'em be put upon. But there's
many a thing will happen afore long, as folk don't expect. Yo may
take my word for that, Jem."

Jem was very willing to take it, but did not express the curiosity
he should have done. So John Barton thought he'd try another hint or
two.

"Working folk won't be ground to the dust much longer. We'n a' had as
much to bear as human nature can bear. So, if th' masters can't do us
no good, and they say they can't, we mun try higher folk."

Still Jem was not curious. He gave up hope of seeing Mary again by
her own good free will; and the next best thing would be, to be alone
to think of her. So, muttering something which he meant to serve
as an excuse for his sudden departure, he hastily wished John good
afternoon, and left him to resume his pipe and his politics.

For three years past, trade had been getting worse and worse, and the
price of provisions higher and higher. This disparity between the
amount of the earnings of the working classes and the price of their
food, occasioned, in more cases than could well be imagined, disease
and death. Whole families went through a gradual starvation. They
only wanted a Dante to record their sufferings. And yet even his
words would fall short of the awful truth; they could only present an
outline of the tremendous facts of the destitution that surrounded
thousands upon thousands in the terrible years 1839, 1840, and 1841.
Even philanthropists who had studied the subject, were forced to own
themselves perplexed in their endeavour to ascertain the real causes
of the misery; the whole matter was of so complicated a nature,
that it became next to impossible to understand it thoroughly. It
need excite no surprise then to learn that a bad feeling between
working-men and the upper classes became very strong in this season
of privation. The indigence and sufferings of the operatives induced
a suspicion in the minds of many of them, that their legislators,
their magistrates, their employers, and even the ministers of
religion, were, in general, their oppressors and enemies; and were in
league for their prostration and enthralment. The most deplorable and
enduring evil that arose out of the period of commercial depression
to which I refer, was this feeling of alienation between the
different classes of society. It is so impossible to describe, or
even faintly to picture, the state of distress which prevailed in the
town at that time, that I will not attempt it; and yet I think again
that surely, in a Christian land, it was not known even so feebly
as words could tell it, or the more happy and fortunate would have
thronged with their sympathy and their aid. In many instances the
sufferers wept first, and then they cursed. Their vindictive feelings
exhibited themselves in rabid politics. And when I hear, as I have
heard, of the sufferings and privations of the poor, of provision
shops where ha'porths of tea, sugar, butter, and even flour, were
sold to accommodate the indigent,--of parents sitting in their
clothes by the fire-side during the whole night for seven weeks
together, in order that their only bed and bedding might be reserved
for the use of their large family,--of others sleeping upon the
cold hearth-stone for weeks in succession, without adequate means
of providing themselves with food or fuel (and this in the depth
of winter),--of others being compelled to fast for days together,
uncheered by any hope of better fortune, living, moreover, or rather
starving, in a crowded garret, or damp cellar, and gradually sinking
under the pressure of want and despair into a premature grave; and
when this has been confirmed by the evidence of their care-worn
looks, their excited feelings, and their desolate homes,--can I
wonder that many of them, in such times of misery and destitution,
spoke and acted with ferocious precipitation?

An idea was now springing up among the operatives, that originated
with the Chartists, but which came at last to be cherished as a
darling child by many and many a one. They could not believe that
government knew of their misery; they rather chose to think it
possible that men could voluntarily assume the office of legislators
for a nation, ignorant of its real state; as who should make domestic
rules for the pretty behaviour of children, without caring to know
that those children had been kept for days without food. Besides,
the starving multitudes had heard, that the very existence of their
distress had been denied in Parliament; and though they felt this
strange and inexplicable, yet the idea that their misery had still
to be revealed in all its depths, and that then some remedy would be
found, soothed their aching hearts, and kept down their rising fury.

So a petition was framed, and signed by thousands in the bright
spring days of 1839, imploring Parliament to hear witnesses who
could testify to the unparalleled destitution of the manufacturing
districts. Nottingham, Sheffield, Glasgow, Manchester, and many other
towns, were busy appointing delegates to convey this petition, who
might speak, not merely of what they had seen, and had heard, but
from what they had borne and suffered. Life-worn, gaunt, anxious,
hunger-stamped men, were those delegates.

One of them was John Barton. He would have been ashamed to own the
flutter of spirits his appointment gave him. There was the childish
delight of seeing London--that went a little way, and but a little
way. There was the vain idea of speaking out his notions before so
many grand folk--that went a little further; and last, there was the
really pure gladness of heart, arising from the idea that he was one
of those chosen to be instruments in making known the distresses of
the people, and consequently in procuring them some grand relief,
by means of which they should never suffer want or care any more.
He hoped largely, but vaguely, of the results of his expedition. An
argosy of the precious hopes of many otherwise despairing creatures,
was that petition to be heard concerning their sufferings.

The night before the morning on which the Manchester delegates were
to leave for London, Barton might be said to hold a levée, so many
neighbours came dropping in. Job Legh had early established himself
and his pipe by John Barton's fire, not saying much, but puffing
away, and imagining himself of use in adjusting the smoothing-irons
that hung before the fire, ready for Mary when she should want them.
As for Mary, her employment was the same as that of Beau Tibbs' wife,
"just washing her father's two shirts," in the pantry back-kitchen;
for she was anxious about his appearance in London. (The coat had
been redeemed, though the silk handkerchief was forfeited.) The door
stood open, as usual, between the houseplace and back-kitchen, so she
gave her greeting to their friends as they entered.

"So, John, yo're bound for London, are yo?" said one.

"Ay, I suppose I mun go," answered John, yielding to necessity as it
were.

"Well, there's many a thing I'd like yo to speak on to the Parliament
people. Thou'lt not spare 'em, John, I hope. Tell 'em our minds; how
we're thinking we've been clemmed long enough, and we donnot see
whatten good they'n been doing, if they can't give us what we're all
crying for sin' the day we were born."

"Ay, ay! I'll tell 'em that, and much more to it, when it gets to my
turn; but thou knows there's many will have their word afore me."

"Well, thou'lt speak at last. Bless thee, lad, do ask 'em to make
th' masters break th' machines. There's never been good times sin'
spinning-jennies came up."

"Machines is th' ruin of poor folk," chimed in several voices.

"For my part," said a shivering, half-clad man, who crept near the
fire, as if ague-stricken, "I would like thee to tell 'em to pass th'
Short-hours Bill. Flesh and blood gets wearied wi' so much work; why
should factory hands work so much longer nor other trades? Just ask
'em that, Barton, will ye?"

Barton was saved the necessity of answering, by the entrance of
Mrs. Davenport, the poor widow he had been so kind to; she looked
half-fed, and eager, but was decently clad. In her hand she brought a
little newspaper parcel, which she took to Mary, who opened it, and
then called out, dangling a shirt collar from her soapy fingers:

"See, father, what a dandy you'll be in London! Mrs. Davenport has
brought you this; made new cut, all after the fashion.--Thank you for
thinking on him."

"Eh, Mary!" said Mrs. Davenport, in a low voice. "Whatten's all I can
do, to what he's done for me and mine? But, Mary, sure I can help ye,
for you'll be busy wi' this journey."

"Just help me wring these out, and then I'll take 'em to th' mangle."

So Mrs. Davenport became a listener to the conversation; and after a
while joined in.

"I'm sure, John Barton, if yo are taking messages to the Parliament
folk, yo'll not object to telling 'em what a sore trial it is, this
law o' theirs, keeping childer fra' factory work, whether they be
weakly or strong. There's our Ben; why, porridge seems to go no way
wi' him, he eats so much; and I han gotten no money to send him t'
school, as I would like; and there he is, rampaging about th' streets
a' day, getting hungrier and hungrier, and picking up a' manner o'
bad ways; and th' inspector won't let him in to work in th' factory,
because he's not right age; though he's twice as strong as Sankey's
little ritling [24] of a lad, as works till he cries for his legs
aching so, though he is right age, and better."


   [Footnote 24: "Ritling," probably a corruption of "ricketling,"
                 a child that suffers from the rickets--a weakling.]


"I've one plan I wish to tell John Barton," said a pompous,
careful-speaking man, "and I should like him for to lay it afore
the Honourable House. My mother comed out o' Oxfordshire, and were
under-laundry-maid in Sir Francis Dashwood's family; and when we were
little ones, she'd tell us stories of their grandeur; and one thing
she named were, that Sir Francis wore two shirts a day. Now he were
all as one as a Parliament man; and many on 'em, I han no doubt, are
like extravagant. Just tell 'em, John, do, that they'd be doing th'
Lancashire weavers a great kindness, if they'd ha' their shirts a'
made o' calico; 'twould make trade brisk, that would, wi' the power
o' shirts they wear."

Job Legh now put in his word. Taking the pipe out of his mouth, and
addressing the last speaker, he said:

"I'll tell ye what, Bill, and no offence, mind ye; there's but
hundreds of them Parliament folk as wear so many shirts to their
back; but there's thousands and thousands o' poor weavers as han
only gotten one shirt i' th' world; ay, and don't know where t'
get another when that rag's done, though they're turning out miles
o' calico every day; and many a mile o't is lying in warehouses,
stopping up trade for want o' purchasers. Yo take my advice, John
Barton, and ask Parliament to set trade free, so as workmen can earn
a decent wage, and buy their two, ay and three, shirts a-year; that
would make weaving brisk."

He put his pipe in his mouth again, and redoubled his puffing to make
up for lost time.

"I'm afeard, neighbours," said John Barton, "I've not much chance o'
telling 'em all yo say; what I think on, is just speaking out about
the distress that they say is nought. When they hear o' children born
on wet flags, without a rag t' cover 'em, or a bit o' food for th'
mother; when they hear of folk lying down to die i' th' streets, or
hiding their want i' some hole o' a cellar till death come to set 'em
free; and when they hear o' all this plague, pestilence, and famine,
they'll surely do somewhat wiser for us than we can guess at now.
Howe'er, I han no objection, if so be there's an opening, to speak up
for what yo say; anyhow, I'll do my best, and yo see now, if better
times don't come after Parliament knows all."

Some shook their heads, but more looked cheery; and then one by one
dropped off, leaving John and his daughter alone.

"Didst thou mark how poorly Jane Wilson looked?" asked he, as they
wound up their hard day's work by a supper eaten over the fire, which
glowed and glimmered through the room, and formed their only light.

"No, I can't say as I did. But she's never rightly held up her head
since the twins died; and all along she has never been a strong
woman."

"Never sin' her accident. Afore that I mind her looking as fresh and
likely a girl as e'er a one in Manchester."

"What accident, father?"

"She cotched [25] her side again a wheel. It were afore wheels were
boxed up. It were just when she were to have been married, and many
a one thought George would ha' been off his bargain; but I knew he
wern't the chap for that trick. Pretty near the first place she went
to when she were able to go about again, was th' Oud Church; poor
wench, all pale and limping she went up the aisle, George holding
her up as tender as a mother, and walking as slow as e'er he could,
not to hurry her, though there were plenty enow of rude lads to cast
their jests at him and her. Her face were white like a sheet when
she came in church, but afore she got to th' altar she were all one
flush. But for a' that it's been a happy marriage, and George has
stuck by me through life like a brother. He'll never hold up his head
again if he loses Jane. I didn't like her looks to-night."

And so he went to bed, the fear of forthcoming sorrow to his friend
mingling with his thoughts of to-morrow, and his hopes for the
future. Mary watched him set off, with her hands over her eyes to
shade them from the bright slanting rays of the morning sun, and then
she turned into the house to arrange its disorder before going to
her work. She wondered if she should like or dislike the evening and
morning solitude; for several hours when the clock struck she thought
of her father, and wondered where he was; she made good resolutions
according to her lights; and by-and-bye came the distractions and
events of the broad full day to occupy her with the present, and to
deaden the memory of the absent.

One of Mary's resolutions was, that she would not be persuaded or
induced to see Mr. Harry Carson during her father's absence. There
was something crooked in her conscience after all; for this very
resolution seemed an acknowledgment that it was wrong to meet him at
any time; and yet she had brought herself to think her conduct quite
innocent and proper, for although unknown to her father, and certain,
even did he know it, to fail of obtaining his sanction, she esteemed
her love-meetings with Mr. Carson as sure to end in her father's good
and happiness. But now that he was away, she would do nothing that he
would disapprove of; no, not even though it was for his own good in
the end.

Now, amongst Miss Simmonds' young ladies was one who had been from
the beginning a confidant in Mary's love affair, made so by Mr.
Carson himself. He had felt the necessity of some third person to
carry letters and messages, and to plead his cause when he was
absent. In a girl named Sally Leadbitter he had found a willing
advocate. She would have been willing to have embarked in a
love-affair herself (especially a clandestine one), for the mere
excitement of the thing; but her willingness was strengthened by
sundry half-sovereigns, which from time to time Mr. Carson bestowed
upon her.

Sally Leadbitter was vulgar-minded to the last degree; never easy
unless her talk was of love and lovers; in her eyes it was an honour
to have had a long list of wooers. So constituted, it was a pity
that Sally herself was but a plain, red-haired, freckled girl; never
likely, one would have thought, to become a heroine on her own
account. But what she lacked in beauty she tried to make up for by a
kind of witty boldness, which gave her what her betters would have
called piquancy. Considerations of modesty or propriety never checked
her utterance of a good thing. She had just talent enough to corrupt
others. Her very good-nature was an evil influence. They could not
hate one who was so kind; they could not avoid one who was so willing
to shield them from scrapes by any exertion of her own; whose ready
fingers would at any time make up for their deficiencies, and whose
still more convenient tongue would at any time invent for them. The
Jews, or Mohammedans (I forget which), believe that there is one
little bone of our body, one of the vertebræ, if I remember rightly,
which will never decay and turn to dust, but will lie incorrupt and
indestructible in the ground until the Last Day: this is the Seed of
the Soul. The most depraved have also their Seed of the Holiness that
shall one day overcome their evil, their one good quality, lurking
hidden, but safe, among all the corrupt and bad.

Sally's seed of the future soul was her love for her mother, an
aged bedridden woman. For her she had self-denial; for her, her
good-nature rose into tenderness; to cheer her lonely bed, her
spirits, in the evenings when her body was often woefully tired,
never flagged, but were ready to recount the events of the day, to
turn them into ridicule, and to mimic, with admirable fidelity, any
person gifted with an absurdity who had fallen under her keen eye.
But the mother was lightly principled like Sally herself; nor was
there need to conceal from her the reason why Mr. Carson gave her
so much money. She chuckled with pleasure, and only hoped that the
wooing would be long a-doing.

Still neither she, nor her daughter, nor Harry Carson liked this
resolution of Mary, not to see him during her father's absence.

One evening (and the early summer evenings were long and bright now),
Sally met Mr. Carson by appointment, to be charged with a letter for
Mary, imploring her to see him, which Sally was to back with all
her powers of persuasion. After parting from him she determined, as
it was not so very late, to go at once to Mary's, and deliver the
message and letter.

She found Mary in great sorrow. She had just heard of George Wilson's
sudden death: her old friend, her father's friend, Jem's father--all
his claims came rushing upon her. Though not guarded from unnecessary
sight or sound of death, as the children of the rich are, yet it had
so often been brought home to her this last three or four months. It
was so terrible thus to see friend after friend depart. Her father,
too, who had dreaded Jane Wilson's death the evening before he set
off. And she, the weakly, was left behind while the strong man was
taken. At any rate the sorrow her father had so feared for him was
spared. Such were the thoughts which came over her.

She could not go to comfort the bereaved, even if comfort were in her
power to give; for she had resolved to avoid Jem; and she felt that
this of all others was not the occasion on which she could keep up a
studiously cold manner.

And in this shock of grief, Sally Leadbitter was the last person
she wished to see. However, she rose to welcome her, betraying her
tear-swollen face.

"Well, I shall tell Mr. Carson to-morrow how you're fretting for him;
it's no more nor he's doing for you, I can tell you."

"For him, indeed!" said Mary, with a toss of her pretty head.

"Ay, miss, for him! You've been sighing as if your heart would break
now for several days, over your work; now arn't you a little goose
not to go and see one who I am sure loves you as his life, and whom
you love; 'How much, Mary?' 'This much,' as the children say"
(opening her arms very wide).

"Nonsense," said Mary, pouting; "I often think I don't love him at
all."

"And I'm to tell him that, am I, next time I see him?" asked Sally.

"If you like," replied Mary. "I'm sure I don't care for that or any
thing else now;" weeping afresh.

But Sally did not like to be the bearer of any such news. She saw she
had gone on the wrong tack, and that Mary's heart was too full to
value either message or letter as she ought. So she wisely paused
in their delivery, and said in a more sympathetic tone than she had
heretofore used,

"Do tell me, Mary, what's fretting you so? You know I never could
abide to see you cry."

"George Wilson's dropped down dead this afternoon," said Mary, fixing
her eyes for one minute on Sally, and the next hiding her face in her
apron as she sobbed anew.

"Dear, dear! All flesh is grass; here to-day and gone to-morrow,
as the Bible says. Still he was an old man, and not good for much;
there's better folk than him left behind. Is th' canting old maid as
was his sister alive yet?"

"I don't know who you mean," said Mary, sharply; for she did know,
and did not like to have her dear, simple Alice so spoken of.

"Come, Mary, don't be so innocent. Is Miss Alice Wilson alive, then;
will that please you? I haven't seen her hereabouts lately."

"No, she's left living here. When the twins died she thought she
could, may be, be of use to her sister, who was sadly cast down, and
Alice thought she could cheer her up; at any rate she could listen to
her when her heart grew overburdened; so she gave up her cellar and
went to live with them."

"Well, good go with her. I'd no fancy for her, and I'd no fancy for
her making my pretty Mary into a Methodee."

"She wasn't a Methodee, she was Church o' England."

"Well, well, Mary, you're very particular. You know what I meant.
Look, who is this letter from?" holding up Henry Carson's letter.

"I don't know, and don't care," said Mary, turning very red.

"My eye! as if I didn't know you did know and did care."

"Well, give it me," said Mary, impatiently, and anxious in her
present mood for her visitor's departure.

Sally relinquished it unwillingly. She had, however, the pleasure of
seeing Mary dimple and blush as she read the letter, which seemed to
say the writer was not indifferent to her.

"You must tell him I can't come," said Mary, raising her eyes at
last. "I have said I won't meet him while father is away, and I
won't."

"But, Mary, he does so look for you. You'd be quite sorry for him,
he's so put out about not seeing you. Besides you go when your
father's at home, without letting on [26] to him, and what harm would
there be in going now?"


   [Footnote 26: "Letting on," informing. In Anglo-Saxon, one
                 meaning of "lætan" was "to admit;" and we say,
                 to _let_ out a secret.]


"Well, Sally! you know my answer, I won't; and I won't."

"I'll tell him to come and see you himself some evening, instead o'
sending me; he'd may be find you not so hard to deal with."

Mary flashed up.

"If he dares to come here while father's away, I'll call the
neighbours in to turn him out, so don't be putting him up to that."

"Mercy on us! one would think you were the first girl that ever had
a lover; have you never heard what other girls do and think no shame
of?"

"Hush, Sally! that's Margaret Jennings at the door."

And in an instant Margaret was in the room. Mary had begged Job Legh
to let her come and sleep with her. In the uncertain fire-light you
could not help noticing that she had the groping walk of a blind
person.

"Well, I must go, Mary," said Sally. "And that's your last word?"

"Yes, yes; good-night." She shut the door gladly on her unwelcome
visitor--unwelcome at that time at least.

"Oh Margaret, have ye heard this sad news about George Wilson?"

"Yes, that I have. Poor creatures, they've been sore tried lately.
Not that I think sudden death so bad a thing; it's easy, and there's
no terrors for him as dies. For them as survives it's very hard. Poor
George! he were such a hearty looking man."

"Margaret," said Mary, who had been closely observing her friend,
"thou'rt very blind to-night, arn't thou? Is it wi' crying? Your eyes
are so swollen and red."

"Yes, dear! but not crying for sorrow. Han ye heard where I was last
night?"

"No; where?"

"Look here." She held up a bright golden sovereign. Mary opened her
large gray eyes with astonishment.

"I'll tell you all how and about it. You see there's a gentleman
lecturing on music at th' Mechanics', and he wants folk to sing his
songs. Well, last night th' counter got a sore throat and couldn't
make a note. So they sent for me. Jacob Butterworth had said a good
word for me, and they asked me would I sing? You may think I was
frightened, but I thought now or never, and said I'd do my best. So I
tried o'er the songs wi' th' lecturer, and then th' managers told me
I were to make myself decent and be there by seven."

"And what did you put on?" asked Mary. "Oh, why didn't you come in
for my pretty pink gingham?"

"I did think on't; but you had na come home then. No! I put on my
merino, as was turned last winter, and my white shawl, and did my
hair pretty tidy; it did well enough. Well, but as I was saying, I
went at seven. I couldn't see to read my music, but I took th' paper
in wi' me, to ha' somewhat to do wi' my fingers. Th' folks' heads
danced, as I stood as right afore 'em all as if I'd been going to
play at ball wi' 'em. You may guess I felt squeamish, but mine
weren't the first song, and th' music sounded like a friend's voice,
telling me to take courage. So to make a long story short, when it
were all o'er th' lecturer thanked me, and th' managers said as how
there never was a new singer so applauded (for they'd clapped and
stamped after I'd done, till I began to wonder how many pair o' shoes
they'd get through a week at that rate, let alone their hands). So
I'm to sing again o' Thursday; and I got a sovereign last night,
and am to have half-a-sovereign every night th' lecturer is at th'
Mechanics'."

"Well, Margaret, I'm right glad to hear it."

"And I don't think you've heard the best bit yet. Now that a way
seemed opened to me, of not being a burden to any one, though it did
please God to make me blind, I thought I'd tell grandfather. I only
telled him about the singing and the sovereign last night, for I
thought I'd not send him to bed wi' a heavy heart; but this morning
I telled him all."

"And how did he take it?"

"He's not a man of many words; and it took him by surprise like."

"I wonder at that; I've noticed it in your ways ever since you telled
me."

"Ay, that's it! If I'd not telled you, and you'd seen me every day,
you'd not ha' noticed the little mite o' difference fra' day to day."

"Well, but what did your grandfather say?"

"Why, Mary," said Margaret, half smiling, "I'm a bit loath to tell
yo, for unless yo knew grandfather's ways like me, yo'd think it
strange. He were taken by surprise, and he said: 'Damn yo!' Then he
began looking at his book as it were, and were very quiet, while I
telled him all about it; how I'd feared, and how downcast I'd been;
and how I were now reconciled to it, if it were th' Lord's will; and
how I hoped to earn money by singing; and while I were talking, I
saw great big tears come dropping on th' book; but in course I never
let on that I saw 'em. Dear grandfather! and all day long he's been
quietly moving things out o' my way, as he thought might trip me
up, and putting things in my way, as he thought I might want; never
knowing I saw and felt what he were doing; for, yo see, he thinks I'm
out and out blind, I guess--as I shall be soon."

Margaret sighed, in spite of her cheerful and relieved tone.

Though Mary caught the sigh, she felt it was better to let it pass
without notice, and began, with the tact which true sympathy rarely
fails to supply, to ask a variety of questions respecting her
friend's musical debut, which tended to bring out more distinctly how
successful it had been.

"Why, Margaret," at length she exclaimed, "thou'lt become as famous,
may be, as that grand lady fra' London, as we seed one night driving
up to th' concert room door in her carriage."

"It looks very like it," said Margaret, with a smile. "And be sure,
Mary, I'll not forget to give thee a lift now an' then when that
comes about. Nay, who knows, if thou'rt a good girl, but mayhappen
I may make thee my lady's maid! Wouldn't that be nice? So I'll e'en
sing to mysel' th' beginning o' one o' my songs,

   'An' ye shall walk in silk attire,
   An' siller hae to spare.'"

"Nay, don't stop; or else give me something a bit more new, for
somehow I never quite liked that part about thinking o' Donald mair."

"Well, though I'm a bit tir'd, I don't care if I do. Before I come,
I were practising well nigh upon two hours this one which I'm to
sing o' Thursday. Th' lecturer said he were sure it would just suit
me, and I should do justice to it; and I should be right sorry to
disappoint him, he were so nice and encouraging like to me. Eh! Mary,
what a pity there isn't more o' that way, and less scolding and
rating i' th' world! It would go a vast deal further. Beside, some o'
th' singers said they were a'most certain it were a song o' his own,
because he were so fidgetty and particular about it, and so anxious
I should give it th' proper expression. And that makes me care still
more. Th' first verse, he said, were to be sung 'tenderly, but
joyously!' I'm afraid I don't quite hit that, but I'll try.

   'What a single word can do!
   Thrilling all the heart-strings through,
   Calling forth fond memories,
   Raining round hope's melodies,
   Steeping all in one bright hue--
   What a single word can do!'

Now it falls into th' minor key, and must be very sad like. I feel
as if I could do that better than t'other.

   'What a single word can do!
   Making life seem all untrue,
   Driving joy and hope away,
   Leaving not one cheering ray
   Blighting every flower that grew--
   What a single word can do!'"

Margaret certainly made the most of this little song. As a factory
worker, listening outside, observed, "She spun it reet [27] fine!"
And if she only sang it at the Mechanics' with half the feeling she
put into it that night, the lecturer must have been hard to please,
if he did not admit that his expectations were more than fulfilled.


   [Footnote 27: "Reet," right; often used for "very."]


When it was ended, Mary's looks told more than words could have done
what she thought of it; and partly to keep in a tear which would fain
have rolled out, she brightened into a laugh, and said, "For certain,
th' carriage is coming. So let us go and dream on it."




CHAPTER IX.

BARTON'S LONDON EXPERIENCES.


   "A life of self-indulgence is for us,
     A life of self-denial is for them;
   For us the streets, broad-built and populous,
     For them unhealthy corners, garrets dim,
     And cellars where the water-rat may swim!
   For us green paths refreshed by frequent rain,
     For them dark alleys where the dust lies grim!
   Not doomed by us to this appointed pain--
   God made us rich and poor--of what do these complain?"

   MRS. NORTON'S "CHILD OF THE ISLANDS."


The next evening it was a warm, pattering, incessant rain, just the
rain to waken up the flowers. But in Manchester, where, alas! there
are no flowers, the rain had only a disheartening and gloomy effect;
the streets were wet and dirty, the drippings from the houses were
wet and dirty, and the people were wet and dirty. Indeed, most kept
within-doors; and there was an unusual silence of footsteps in the
little paved courts.

Mary had to change her clothes after her walk home; and had hardly
settled herself before she heard some one fumbling at the door. The
noise continued long enough to allow her to get up, and go and open
it. There stood--could it be? yes it was, her father!

Drenched and way-worn, there he stood! He came in with no word to
Mary in return for her cheery and astonished greeting. He sat down by
the fire in his wet things, unheeding. But Mary would not let him so
rest. She ran up and brought down his working-day clothes, and went
into the pantry to rummage up their little bit of provision while
he changed by the fire, talking all the while as gaily as she could,
though her father's depression hung like lead on her heart.

For Mary, in her seclusion at Miss Simmonds',--where the chief talk
was of fashions, and dress, and parties to be given, for which such
and such gowns would be wanted, varied with a slight whispered
interlude occasionally about love and lovers,--had not heard the
political news of the day: that Parliament had refused to listen to
the working-men, when they petitioned with all the force of their
rough, untutored words to be heard concerning the distress which was
riding, like the Conqueror on his Pale Horse, among the people; which
was crushing their lives out of them, and stamping woe-marks over the
land.

When he had eaten and was refreshed, they sat in silence for some
time; for Mary wished him to tell her what oppressed him so, yet
durst not ask. In this she was wise; for when we are heavy laden in
our hearts, it falls in better with our humour to reveal our case in
our own way, and our own time.

Mary sat on a stool at her father's feet in old childish guise, and
stole her hand into his, while his sadness infected her, and she
"caught the trick of grief, and sighed," she knew not why.

"Mary, we mun speak to our God to hear us, for man will not hearken;
no, not now, when we weep tears o' blood."

In an instant Mary understood the fact, if not the details, that so
weighed down her father's heart. She pressed his hand with silent
sympathy. She did not know what to say, and was so afraid of speaking
wrongly, that she was silent. But when his attitude had remained
unchanged for more than half-an-hour, his eyes gazing vacantly and
fixedly at the fire, no sound but now and then a deep drawn sigh to
break the weary ticking of the clock, and the drip-drop from the roof
without, Mary could bear it no longer. Any thing to rouse her father.
Even bad news.

"Father, do you know George Wilson's dead?" (Her hand was suddenly
and almost violently compressed.) "He dropped down dead in Oxford
Road yester morning. It's very sad, isn't it, father?"

Her tears were ready to flow as she looked up in her father's face
for sympathy. Still the same fixed look of despair, not varied by
grief for the dead.

"Best for him to die," he said, in a low voice.

This was unbearable. Mary got up under pretence of going to tell
Margaret that she need not come to sleep with her to-night, but
really to ask Job Legh to come and cheer her father.

She stopped outside their door. Margaret was practising her singing,
and through the still night air her voice rang out like that of an
angel.

"Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith your God."

The old Hebrew prophetic words fell like dew on Mary's heart. She
could not interrupt. She stood listening and "comforted," till the
little buzz of conversation again began, and then entered and told
her errand.

Both grandfather and grand-daughter rose instantly to fulfil her
request.

"He's just tired out, Mary," said old Job. "He'll be a different man
to-morrow."

There is no describing the looks and tones that have power over an
aching, heavy laden heart; but in an hour or so John Barton was
talking away as freely as ever, though all his talk ran, as was
natural, on the disappointment of his fond hope, of the forlorn hope
of many.

"Ay, London's a fine place," said he, "and finer folk live in it than
I ever thought on, or ever heerd tell on except in th' story-books.
They are having their good things now, that afterwards they may be
tormented."

Still at the old parable of Dives and Lazarus! Does it haunt the
minds of the rich as it does those of the poor?

"Do tell us all about London, dear father," asked Mary, who was
sitting at her old post by her father's knee.

"How can I tell yo a' about it, when I never seed one-tenth of it.
It's as big as six Manchesters, they telled me. One-sixth may be made
up o' grand palaces, and three-sixths o' middling kind, and th' rest
o' holes o' iniquity and filth, such as Manchester knows nought on,
I'm glad to say."

"Well, father, but did you see th' Queen?"

"I believe I didn't, though one day I thought I'd seen her many a
time. You see," said he, turning to Job Legh, "there were a day
appointed for us to go to Parliament House. We were most on us biding
at a public-house in Holborn, where they did very well for us. Th'
morning of taking our petition we'd such a spread for breakfast as
th' Queen hersel might ha' sitten down to. I suppose they thought
we wanted putting in heart. There were mutton kidneys, and sausages,
and broiled ham, and fried beef and onions; more like a dinner nor
a breakfast. Many on our chaps though, I could see, could eat but
little. Th' food stuck in their throats when they thought o' them
at home, wives and little ones, as had, may be at that very time,
nought to eat. Well, after breakfast, we were all set to walk in
procession, and a time it took to put us in order, two and two, and
the petition as was yards long, carried by th' foremost pairs. The
men looked grave enough, yo may be sure; and such a set of thin, wan,
wretched-looking chaps as they were!"

"Yourself is none to boast on."

"Ay, but I were fat and rosy to many a one. Well, we walked on and
on through many a street, much the same as Deansgate. We had to walk
slowly, slowly, for th' carriages an' cabs as thronged th' streets.
I thought by-and-bye we should may be get clear on 'em, but as th'
streets grew wider they grew worse, and at last we were fairly
blocked up at Oxford Street. We getten across at last though, and my
eyes! the grand streets we were in then! They're sadly puzzled how
to build houses though in London; there'd be an opening for a good
steady master-builder there, as know'd his business. For yo see the
houses are many on 'em built without any proper shape for a body
to live in; some on 'em they've after thought would fall down, so
they've stuck great ugly pillars out before 'em. And some on 'em (we
thought they must be th' tailor's sign) had getten stone men and
women as wanted clothes stuck on 'em. I were like a child, I forgot
a' my errand in looking about me. By this it were dinner-time, or
better, as we could tell by th' sun, right above our heads, and we
were dusty and tired, going a step now and a step then. Well, at
last we getten into a street grander nor all, leading to th' Queen's
palace, and there it were I thought I saw th' Queen. Yo've seen th'
hearses wi' white plumes, Job?"

Job assented.

"Well, them undertaker folk are driving a pretty trade in London.
Wellnigh every lady we saw in a carriage had hired one o' them plumes
for the day, and had it niddle noddling on her head. It were th'
Queen's Drawing-room, they said, and th' carriages went bowling along
toward her house, some wi' dressed up gentlemen like circus folk in
'em, and rucks [28] o' ladies in others. Carriages themselves were
great shakes too. Some o' th' gentlemen as couldn't get inside hung
on behind, wi' nosegays to smell at, and sticks to keep off folk as
might splash their silk stockings. I wondered why they didn't hire a
cab rather than hang on like a whip-behind boy; but I suppose they
wished to keep wi' their wives, Darby and Joan like. Coachmen were
little squat men, wi' wigs like th' oud fashioned parsons. Well, we
could na get on for these carriages, though we waited and waited.
Th' horses were too fat to move quick; they'n never known want o'
food, one might tell by their sleek coats; and police pushed us
back when we tried to cross. One or two on 'em struck wi' their
sticks, and coachmen laughed, and some officers as stood nigh put
their spy-glasses in their eye, and left 'em sticking there like
mountebanks. One o' th' police struck me. 'Whatten business have yo
to do that?' said I.


   [Footnote 28: "Rucks," a great quantity.]


"'You're frightening them horses,' says he, in his mincing way (for
Londoners are mostly all tongue-tied, and can't say their a's and
i's properly), 'and it's our business to keep you from molesting the
ladies and gentlemen going to her Majesty's Drawing-room.'

"'And why are we to be molested?' asked I, 'going decently about
our business, which is life and death to us, and many a little one
clemming at home in Lancashire? Which business is of most consequence
i' the sight o' God, think yo, our'n or them gran ladies and
gentlemen as yo think so much on?'

"But I might as well ha' held my peace, for he only laughed."

John ceased. After waiting a little to see if he would go on of
himself, Job said,

"Well, but that's not a' your story, man. Tell us what happened when
yo got to th' Parliament House."

After a little pause John answered,

"If yo please, neighbour, I'd rather say nought about that. It's not
to be forgotten or forgiven either by me or many another; but I canna
tell of our down-casting just as a piece of London news. As long as
I live, our rejection that day will bide in my heart; and as long as
I live I shall curse them as so cruelly refused to hear us; but I'll
not speak of it no [29] more."


   [Footnote 29: A similar use of a double negative is not
                 unfrequent in Chaucer; as in the "Miller's Tale":
                     "That of no wife toke he non offering
                     For curtesie, he sayd, he n'old non."]


So, daunted in their inquiries, they sat silent for a few minutes.

Old Job, however, felt that some one must speak, else all the good
they had done in dispelling John Barton's gloom was lost. So after
awhile he thought of a subject, neither sufficiently dissonant from
the last to jar on the full heart, nor too much the same to cherish
the continuance of the gloomy train of thought.

"Did you ever hear tell," said he to Mary, "that I were in London
once?"

"No!" said she, with surprise, and looking at Job with increased
respect.

"Ay, but I were though, and Peg there too, though she minds nought
about it, poor wench! You must know I had but one child, and she were
Margaret's mother. I loved her above a bit, and one day when she
came (standing behind me for that I should not see her blushes, and
stroking my cheeks in her own coaxing way), and told me she and Frank
Jennings (as was a joiner lodging near us) should be so happy if they
were married, I could not find in my heart t' say her nay, though I
went sick at the thought of losing her away from my home. Howe'er,
she were my only child, and I never said nought of what I felt, for
fear o' grieving her young heart. But I tried to think o' the time
when I'd been young mysel, and had loved her blessed mother, and how
we'd left father and mother and gone out into th' world together,
and I'm now right thankful I held my peace, and didna fret her wi'
telling her how sore I was at parting wi' her that were the light o'
my eyes."

"But," said Mary, "you said the young man were a neighbour."

"Ay, so he were; and his father afore him. But work were rather slack
in Manchester, and Frank's uncle sent him word o' London work and
London wages, so he were to go there; and it were there Margaret was
to follow him. Well, my heart aches yet at thought of those days.
She so happy, and he so happy; only the poor father as fretted sadly
behind their backs. They were married, and stayed some days wi' me
afore setting off; and I've often thought sin' Margaret's heart
failed her many a time those few days, and she would fain ha' spoken;
but I knew fra' mysel it were better to keep it pent up, and I never
let on what I were feeling. I knew what she meant when she came
kissing, and holding my hand, and all her old childish ways o' loving
me. Well, they went at last. You know them two letters, Margaret?"

"Yes, sure," replied his grand-daughter.

"Well, them two were the only letters I ever had fra' her, poor lass.
She said in them she were very happy, and I believe she were. And
Frank's family heard he were in good work. In one o' her letters,
poor thing, she ends wi' saying, 'Farewell, Grandad!' wi' a line
drawn under grandad, and fra' that an' other hints I knew she were in
th' family way; and I said nought, but I screwed up a little money,
thinking come Whitsuntide I'd take a holiday and go and see her an'
th' little one. But one day towards Whitsuntide comed Jennings wi' a
grave face, and says he, 'I hear our Frank and your Margaret's both
getten the fever.' You might ha' knocked me down wi' a straw, for
it seemed as if God told me what th' upshot would be. Old Jennings
had gotten a letter, yo see, fra' the landlady they lodged wi'; a
well-penned letter, asking if they'd no friends to come and nurse
them. She'd caught it first, and Frank, who was as tender o' her as
her own mother could ha' been, had nursed her till he'd caught it
himsel; and she expecting her down-lying [30] every day. Well, t'
make a long story short, Old Jennings and I went up by that night's
coach. So you see, Mary, that was the way I got to London."


   [Footnote 30: "Down-lying," lying-in.]


"But how was your daughter when you got there?" asked Mary,
anxiously.

"She were at rest, poor wench, and so were Frank. I guessed as much
when I see'd th' landlady's face, all swelled wi' crying, when she
opened th' door to us. We said, 'Where are they?' and I knew they
were dead, fra' her look; but Jennings didn't, as I take it; for
when she showed us into a room wi' a white sheet on th' bed, and
underneath it, plain to be seen, two still figures, he screeched out
as if he'd been a woman.

"Yet he'd other childer and I'd none. There lay my darling, my only
one. She were dead, and there were no one to love me, no, not one. I
disremember [31] rightly what I did; but I know I were very quiet,
while my heart were crushed within me.


   [Footnote 31: "Disremember," forget.]


"Jennings could na' stand being in th' room at all, so th' landlady
took him down, and I were glad to be alone. It grew dark while I sat
there; and at last th' landlady come up again, and said, 'Come here.'
So I got up and walked into th' light, but I had to hold by th'
stair-rails, I were so weak and dizzy. She led me into a room, where
Jennings lay on a sofa fast asleep, wi' his pocket handkercher over
his head for a night-cap. She said he'd cried himself fairly off
to sleep. There were tea on th' table all ready; for she were a
kind-hearted body. But she still said, 'Come here,' and took hold o'
my arm. So I went round the table, and there were a clothes-basket by
th' fire, wi' a shawl put o'er it. 'Lift that up,' says she, and I
did; and there lay a little wee babby fast asleep. My heart gave a
leap, and th' tears comed rushing into my eyes first time that day.
'Is it hers?' said I, though I knew it were. 'Yes,' said she. 'She
were getting a bit better o' the fever, and th' babby were born; and
then the poor young man took worse and died, and she were not many
hours behind.'

"Little mite of a thing! and yet it seemed her angel come back to
comfort me. I were quite jealous o' Jennings whenever he went near
the babby. I thought it were more my flesh and blood than his'n, and
yet I were afeared he would claim it. However, that were far enough
fra' his thoughts; he'd plenty other childer, and as I found out at
after he'd all along been wishing me to take it. Well, we buried
Margaret and her husband in a big, crowded, lonely churchyard in
London. I were loath to leave them there, as I thought, when they
rose again, they'd feel so strange at first away fra Manchester, and
all old friends; but it couldna be helped. Well, God watches o'er
their grave there as well as here. That funeral cost a mint o' money,
but Jennings and I wished to do th' thing decent. Then we'd the stout
little babby to bring home. We'd not overmuch money left; but it were
fine weather, and we thought we'd take th' coach to Brummagem, and
walk on. It were a bright May morning when last I saw London town,
looking back from a big hill a mile or two off. And in that big mass
o' a place I were leaving my blessed child asleep--in her last sleep.
Well, God's will be done! She's gotten to heaven afore me; but I
shall get there at last, please God, though it's a long while first.

"The babby had been fed afore we set out, and th' coach moving kept
it asleep, bless its little heart. But when th' coach stopped for
dinner it were awake, and crying for its pobbies. [32] So we asked
for some bread and milk, and Jennings took it first for to feed it;
but it made its mouth like a square, and let it run out at each o'
th' four corners. 'Shake it, Jennings,' says I; 'that's the way they
make water run through a funnel, when it's o'er full; and a child's
mouth is broad end o' th' funnel, and th' gullet the narrow one.' So
he shook it, but it only cried th' more. 'Let me have it,' says I,
thinking he were an awkward oud chap. But it were just as bad wi' me.
By shaking th' babby we got better nor a gill into its mouth, but
more nor that came up again, wetting a' th' nice dry clothes landlady
had put on. Well, just as we'd gotten to th' dinner-table, and helped
oursels, and eaten two mouthful, came in th' guard, and a fine chap
wi' a sample o' calico flourishing in his hand. 'Coach is ready!'
says one; 'Half-a-crown your dinner!' says th' other. Well, we
thought it a deal for both our dinners, when we'd hardly tasted 'em;
but, bless your life, it were half-a-crown apiece, and a shilling
for th' bread and milk as were possetted all over babby's clothes.
We spoke up again [33] it; but every body said it were the rule, so
what could two poor oud chaps like us do again it? Well, poor babby
cried without stopping to take breath, fra' that time till we got
to Brummagem for the night. My heart ached for th' little thing. It
caught wi' its wee mouth at our coat sleeves and at our mouths, when
we tried t' comfort it by talking to it. Poor little wench! It wanted
its mammy, as were lying cold in th' grave. 'Well,' says I, 'it'll
be clemmed to death, if it lets out its supper as it did its dinner.
Let's get some woman to feed it; it comes natural to women to do for
babbies.' So we asked th' chamber-maid at the inn, and she took quite
kindly to it; and we got a good supper, and grew rare and sleepy,
what wi' th' warmth, and wi' our long ride i' th' open air. Th'
chamber-maid said she would like t' have it t' sleep wi' her, only
missis would scold so; but it looked so quiet and smiling like, as it
lay in her arms, that we thought 'twould be no trouble to have it wi'
us. I says: 'See, Jennings, how women-folk do quieten babbies; it's
just as I said.' He looked grave; he were always thoughtful-looking,
though I never heard him say any thing very deep. At last says he--


   [Footnote 32: "Pobbies," or "pobs," child's porridge.]

   [Footnote 33: "Again," for against. "He that is not with me,
                 he is ageyn me."--_Wickliffe's Version._]


"'Young woman! have you gotten a spare night-cap?'

"'Missis always keeps night-caps for gentlemen as does not like to
unpack,' says she, rather quick.

"'Ay, but young woman, it's one of your night-caps I want. Th' babby
seems to have taken a mind to yo; and may be in th' dark it might
take me for yo if I'd getten your night-cap on.'

"The chambermaid smirked and went for a cap, but I laughed outright
at th' oud bearded chap thinking he'd make hissel like a woman just
by putting on a woman's cap. Howe'er he'd not be laughed out on't, so
I held th' babby till he were in bed. Such a night as we had on it!
Babby began to scream o' th' oud fashion, and we took it turn and
turn about to sit up and rock it. My heart were very sore for th'
little one, as it groped about wi' its mouth; but for a' that I could
scarce keep fra' smiling at th' thought o' us two oud chaps, th' one
wi' a woman's night-cap on, sitting on our hinder ends for half th'
night, hushabying a babby as wouldn't be hushabied. Toward morning,
poor little wench! it fell asleep, fairly tired out wi' crying, but
even in its sleep it gave such pitiful sobs, quivering up fra' the
very bottom of its little heart, that once or twice I almost wished
it lay on its mother's breast, at peace for ever. Jennings fell
asleep too; but I began for to reckon up our money. It were little
enough we had left, our dinner the day afore had ta'en so much. I
didn't know what our reckoning would be for that night lodging, and
supper, and breakfast. Doing a sum alway sent me asleep ever sin' I
were a lad; so I fell sound in a short time, and were only wakened by
chambermaid tapping at th' door, to say she'd dress the babby afore
her missis were up if we liked. But bless yo', we'd never thought o'
undressing it th' night afore, and now it were sleeping so sound, and
we were so glad o' the peace and quietness, that we thought it were
no good to waken it up to screech again.

"Well! (there's Mary asleep for a good listener!) I suppose you're
getting weary of my tale, so I'll not be long over ending it. Th'
reckoning left us very bare, and we thought we'd best walk home,
for it were only sixty mile, they telled us, and not stop again for
nought, save victuals. So we left Brummagem, (which is as black a
place as Manchester, without looking so like home), and walked a'
that day, carrying babby turn and turn about. It were well fed by
chambermaid afore we left, and th' day were fine, and folk began to
have some knowledge o' th' proper way o' speaking, and we were more
cheery at thoughts o' home (though mine, God knows, were lonesome
enough). We stopped none for dinner, but at baggin-time [34] we
getten a good meal at a public-house, an' fed th' babby as well as
we could, but that were but poorly. We got a crust too, for it to
suck--chambermaid put us up to that. That night, whether we were
tired or whatten, I don't know, but it were dree [35] work, and poor
wench had slept out her sleep, and began th' cry as wore my heart out
again. Says Jennings, says he,


   [Footnote 34: "Baggin-time," time of the evening meal.]

   [Footnote 35: "Dree," long and tedious. Anglo-Saxon, "dreogan,"
                 to suffer, to endure.]


"'We should na ha' set out so like gentlefolk a top o' the coach
yesterday.'

"'Nay, lad! We should ha' had more to walk, if we had na ridden, and
I'm sure both you and I'se [36] weary o' tramping.'


   [Footnote 36: "I have not been, nor _is_, nor never
                 schal."--_Wickliffe's "Apology," p. 1._]


"So he were quiet a bit. But he were one o' them as were sure to find
out somewhat had been done amiss, when there were no going back to
undo it. So presently he coughs, as if he were going to speak, and
I says to mysel, 'At it again, my lad.' Says he,

"'I ax pardon, neighbour, but it strikes me it would ha' been better
for my son if he had never begun to keep company wi' your daughter.'

"Well! that put me up, and my heart got very full, and but that I
were carrying _her_ babby, I think I should ha' struck him. At last
I could hold in no longer, and says I,

"'Better say at once it would ha' been better for God never to ha'
made th' world, for then we'd never ha' been in it, to have had th'
heavy hearts we have now.'

"Well! he said that were rank blasphemy; but I thought his way of
casting up again th' events God had pleased to send, were worse
blasphemy. Howe'er, I said nought more angry, for th' little babby's
sake, as were th' child o' his dead son, as well as o' my dead
daughter.

"Th' longest lane will have a turning, and that night came to an end
at last; and we were foot-sore and tired enough, and to my mind th'
babby were getting weaker and weaker, and it wrung my heart to hear
its little wail; I'd ha' given my right hand for one of yesterday's
hearty cries. We were wanting our breakfasts, and so were it too,
motherless babby! We could see no public-house, so about six o'clock
(only we thought it were later) we stopped at a cottage where a woman
were moving about near th' open door. Says I, 'Good woman, may we
rest us a bit?' 'Come in,' says she, wiping a chair, as looked bright
enough afore, wi' her apron. It were a cheery, clean room; and we
were glad to sit down again, though I thought my legs would never
bend at th' knees. In a minute she fell a noticing th' babby, and
took it in her arms, and kissed it again and again. 'Missis,' says I,
'we're not without money, and if yo'd give us somewhat for breakfast,
we'd pay yo honest, and if yo would wash and dress that poor babby,
and get some pobbies down its throat, for it's well-nigh clemmed, I'd
pray for yo' till my dying day.' So she said nought, but gived me th'
babby back, and afore yo' could say Jack Robinson, she'd a pan on th'
fire, and bread and cheese on th' table. When she turned round, her
face looked red, and her lips were tight pressed together. Well! we
were right down glad on our breakfast, and God bless and reward that
woman for her kindness that day; she fed th' poor babby as gently
and softly, and spoke to it as tenderly as its own poor mother could
ha' done. It seemed as if that stranger and it had known each other
afore, maybe in Heaven, where folk's spirits come from they say; th'
babby looked up so lovingly in her eyes, and made little noises more
like a dove than aught else. Then she undressed it (poor darling! it
were time), touching it so softly; and washed it from head to foot,
and as many on its things were dirty; and what bits o' things its
mother had gotten ready for it had been sent by th' carrier fra
London, she put 'em aside; and wrapping little naked babby in her
apron, she pulled out a key, as were fastened to a black ribbon, and
hung down her breast, and unlocked a drawer in th' dresser. I were
sorry to be prying, but I could na' help seeing in that drawer some
little child's clothes, all strewed wi' lavendar, and lying by 'em
a little whip an' a broken rattle. I began to have an insight into
that woman's heart then. She took out a thing or two; and locked the
drawer, and went on dressing babby. Just about then come her husband
down, a great big fellow as didn't look half awake, though it were
getting late; but he'd heard all as had been said down-stairs, as
were plain to be seen; but he were a gruff chap. We'd finished our
breakfast, and Jennings were looking hard at th' woman as she were
getting the babby to sleep wi' a sort of rocking way. At length says
he, 'I ha learnt th' way now; it's two jiggits and a shake, two
jiggits and a shake. I can get that babby asleep now mysel.'

"The man had nodded cross enough to us, and had gone to th' door, and
stood there whistling wi' his hands in his breeches-pockets, looking
abroad. But at last he turns and says, quite sharp,

"'I say, missis, I'm to have no breakfast to-day, I s'pose.'

"So wi' that she kissed th' child, a long, soft kiss; and looking in
my face to see if I could take her meaning, gave me th' babby without
a word. I were loath to stir, but I saw it were better to go. So
giving Jennings a sharp nudge (for he'd fallen asleep), I says,
'Missis, what's to pay?' pulling out my money wi' a jingle that she
might na guess we were at all bare o' cash. So she looks at her
husband, who said ne'er a word, but were listening wi' all his ears
nevertheless; and when she saw he would na say, she said, hesitating,
as if pulled two ways, by her fear o' him, 'Should you think sixpence
over much?' It were so different to public-house reckoning, for we'd
eaten a main deal afore the chap came down. So says I, 'And, missis,
what should we gie you for the babby's bread and milk?' (I had it
once in my mind to say 'and for a' your trouble with it,' but my
heart would na let me say it, for I could read in her ways how it had
been a work o' love.) So says she, quite quick, and stealing a look
at her husband's back, as looked all ear, if ever a back did, 'Oh, we
could take nought for the little babby's food, if it had eaten twice
as much, bless it.' Wi' that he looked at her; such a scowling look!
She knew what he meant, and stepped softly across the floor to him,
and put her hand on his arm. He seem'd as though he'd shake it off
by a jerk on his elbow, but she said quite low, 'For poor little
Johnnie's sake, Richard.' He did not move or speak again, and after
looking in his face for a minute, she turned away, swallowing deep in
her throat. She kissed th' sleeping babby as she passed, when I paid
her. To quieten th' gruff husband, and stop him if he rated her, I
could na help slipping another sixpence under th' loaf, and then we
set off again. Last look I had o' that woman she were quietly wiping
her eyes wi' the corner of her apron, as she went about her husband's
breakfast. But I shall know her in heaven."

He stopped to think of that long-ago May morning, when he had carried
his grand-daughter under the distant hedge-rows and beneath the
flowering sycamores.

"There's nought more to say, wench," said he to Margaret, as she
begged him to go on. "That night we reached Manchester, and I'd found
out that Jennings would be glad enough to give up babby to me, so I
took her home at once, and a blessing she's been to me."

They were all silent for a few minutes; each following out the
current of their thoughts. Then, almost simultaneously, their
attention fell upon Mary. Sitting on her little stool, her head
resting on her father's knee, and sleeping as soundly as any infant,
her breath (still like an infant's) came and went as softly as a bird
steals to her leafy nest. Her half-open mouth was as scarlet as the
winter-berries, and contrasted finely with the clear paleness of
her complexion, where the eloquent blood flushed carnation at each
motion. Her black eye-lashes lay on the delicate cheek, which was
still more shaded by the masses of her golden hair, that seemed to
form a nest-like pillow for her as she lay. Her father in fond pride
straightened one glossy curl, for an instant, as if to display its
length and silkiness. The little action awoke her, and, like nine out
of ten people in similar circumstances, she exclaimed, opening her
eyes to their fullest extent,

"I'm not asleep. I've been awake all the time."

Even her father could not keep from smiling, and Job Legh and
Margaret laughed outright.

"Come, wench," said Job, "don't look so gloppened [37] because
thou'st fallen asleep while an oud chap like me was talking on oud
times. It were like enough to send thee to sleep. Try if thou canst
keep thine eyes open while I read thy father a bit on a poem as is
written by a weaver like oursel. A rare chap I'll be bound is he who
could weave verse like this."


   [Footnote 37: "Gloppened," amazed, frightened.]


So adjusting his spectacles on nose, cocking his chin, crossing his
legs, and coughing to clear his voice, he read aloud a little poem of
Samuel Bamford's [38] he had picked up somewhere.


   [Footnote 38: The fine-spirited author of "Passages in the Life
                 of a Radical"--a man who illustrates his order,
                 and shows what nobility may be in a cottage.]


   God help the poor, who, on this wintry morn,
     Come forth from alleys dim and courts obscure.
   God help yon poor pale girl, who droops forlorn,
     And meekly her affliction doth endure;
   God help her, outcast lamb; she trembling stands,
   All wan her lips, and frozen red her hands;
   Her sunken eyes are modestly down-cast,
   Her night-black hair streams on the fitful blast;
   Her bosom, passing fair, is half revealed,
   And oh! so cold, the snow lies there congealed;
   Her feet benumbed, her shoes all rent and worn,
   God help thee, outcast lamb, who standst forlorn!
         God help the poor!

   God help the poor! An infant's feeble wail
     Comes from yon narrow gateway, and behold!
   A female crouching there, so deathly pale,
     Huddling her child, to screen it from the cold;
   Her vesture scant, her bonnet crushed and torn;
     A thin shawl doth her baby dear enfold:
   And so she 'bides the ruthless gale of morn,
     Which almost to her heart hath sent its cold.
   And now she, sudden, darts a ravening look,
   As one, with new hot bread, goes past the nook;
   And, as the tempting load is onward borne,
   She weeps. God help thee, helpless one, forlorn!
         God help the poor!

   God help the poor! Behold yon famished lad,
     No shoes, nor hose, his wounded feet protect;
   With limping gait, and looks so dreamy sad,
     He wanders onward, stopping to inspect
   Each window, stored with articles of food.
     He yearns but to enjoy one cheering meal;
   Oh! to the hungry palate, viands rude,
     Would yield a zest the famished only feel!
   He now devours a crust of mouldy bread;
     With teeth and hands the precious boon is torn;
   Unmindful of the storm that round his head
     Impetuous sweeps. God help thee, child forlorn!
         God help the poor!

   God help the poor! Another have I found--
     A bowed and venerable man is he;
   His slouched hat with faded crape is bound;
     His coat is gray, and threadbare too, I see.
   "The rude winds" seem "to mock his hoary hair;"
   His shirtless bosom to the blast is bare.
   Anon he turns and casts a wistful eye,
     And with scant napkin wipes the blinding spray;
   And looks around, as if he fain would spy
     Friends he had feasted in his better day:
   Ah! some are dead; and some have long forborne
   To know the poor; and he is left forlorn!
         God help the poor!

   God help the poor, who in lone valleys dwell,
     Or by far hills, where whin and heather grow;
   Theirs is a story sad indeed to tell,
     Yet little cares the world, and less 't would know
     About the toil and want men undergo.
   The wearying loom doth call them up at morn,
     They work till worn-out nature sinks to sleep,
     They taste, but are not fed. The snow drifts deep
     Around the fireless cot, and blocks the door;
     The night-storm howls a dirge across the moor;
   And shall they perish thus--oppressed and lorn?
   Shall toil and famine, hopeless, still be borne?
     No! God will yet arise, and help the poor.

"Amen!" said Barton, solemnly, and sorrowfully. "Mary! wench, couldst
thou copy me them lines, dost think?--that's to say, if Job there has
no objection."

"Not I. More they're heard and read and the better, say I."

So Mary took the paper. And the next day, on the blank half sheet
of a valentine, all bordered with hearts and darts--a valentine she
had once suspected to come from Jem Wilson--she copied Bamford's
beautiful little poem.




CHAPTER X.

RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL.


   "My heart, once soft as woman's tear, is gnarled
   With gloating on the ills I cannot cure."

   ELLIOTT.

   "Then guard and shield her innocence,
     Let her not fall like me;
   'Twere better, Oh! a thousand times,
     She in her grave should be."

   "THE OUTCAST."


Despair settled down like a heavy cloud; and now and then, through
the dead calm of sufferings, came pipings of stormy winds,
foretelling the end of these dark prognostics. In times of sorrowful
or fierce endurance, we are often soothed by the mere repetition of
old proverbs which tell the experience of our forefathers; but now,
"it's a long lane that has no turning," "the weariest day draws to an
end," &c., seemed false and vain sayings, so long and so weary was
the pressure of the terrible times. Deeper and deeper still sank the
poor; it showed how much lingering suffering it takes to kill men,
that so few (in comparison) died during those times. But remember! we
only miss those who do men's work in their humble sphere; the aged,
the feeble, the children, when they die, are hardly noted by the
world; and yet to many hearts, their deaths make a blank which long
years will never fill up. Remember, too, that though it may take much
suffering to kill the able-bodied and effective members of society,
it does _not_ take much to reduce them to worn, listless, diseased
creatures, who thenceforward crawl through life with moody hearts and
pain-stricken bodies.

The people had thought the poverty of the preceding years hard to
bear, and had found its yoke heavy; but this year added sorely to
its weight. Former times had chastised them with whips, but this
chastised them with scorpions.

Of course, Barton had his share of mere bodily sufferings. Before he
had gone up to London on his vain errand, he had been working short
time. But in the hopes of speedy redress by means of the interference
of Parliament, he had thrown up his place; and now, when he asked
leave to resume work, he was told they were diminishing their number
of hands every week, and he was made aware by the remarks of fellow
workmen, that a Chartist delegate, and a leading member of a Trades'
Union, was not likely to be favoured in his search after employment.
Still he tried to keep up a brave heart concerning himself. He knew
he could bear hunger; for that power of endurance had been called
forth when he was a little child, and had seen his mother hide her
daily morsel to share it among her children, and when he, being the
eldest, had told the noble lie, that "he was not hungry, could not
eat a bit more," in order to imitate his mother's bravery, and still
the sharp wail of the younger infants. Mary, too, was secure of two
meals a day at Miss Simmonds'; though, by the way, the dress-maker,
too, feeling the effect of bad times, had left off giving tea to her
apprentices, setting them the example of long abstinence by putting
off her own meal until work was done for the night, however late that
might be.

But the rent! It was half-a-crown a week--nearly all Mary's
earnings--and much less room might do for them, only two.--(Now came
the time to be thankful that the early dead were saved from the evil
to come.)--The agricultural labourer generally has strong local
attachments; but they are far less common, almost obliterated, among
the inhabitants of a town. Still there are exceptions, and Barton
formed one. He had removed to his present house just after the last
bad times, when little Tom had sickened and died. He had then thought
the bustle of a removal would give his poor stunned wife something to
do, and he had taken more interest in the details of the proceeding
than he otherwise would have done, in the hope of calling her forth
to action again. So he seemed to know every brass-headed nail driven
up for her convenience. One only had been displaced. It was Esther's
bonnet nail, which, in his deep revengeful anger against her, after
his wife's death, he had torn out of the wall, and cast into the
street. It would be hard work to leave that house, which yet seemed
hallowed by his wife's presence in the happy days of old. But he
was a law unto himself, though sometimes a bad, fierce law; and
he resolved to give the rent-collector notice, and look out for a
cheaper abode, and tell Mary they must flit. Poor Mary! she loved the
house, too. It was wrenching up her natural feelings of home, for it
would be long before the fibres of her heart would gather themselves
about another place.

This trial was spared. The collector (of himself), on the very Monday
when Barton planned to give him notice of his intention to leave,
lowered the rent threepence a week, just enough to make Barton
compromise and agree to stay on a little longer.

But by degrees the house was stripped of its little ornaments. Some
were broken; and the odd twopences and threepences wanted to pay for
their repairs, were required for the far sterner necessity of food.
And by-and-bye Mary began to part with other superfluities at the
pawn-shop. The smart tea-tray and tea-caddy, long and carefully kept,
went for bread for her father. He did not ask for it, or complain,
but she saw hunger in his shrunk, fierce, animal look. Then the
blankets went, for it was summer time, and they could spare them; and
their sale made a fund, which Mary fancied would last till better
times came. But it was soon all gone; and then she looked around
the room to crib it of its few remaining ornaments. To all these
proceedings her father said never a word. If he fasted, or feasted
(after the sale of some article), on an unusual meal of bread and
cheese, he took all with a sullen indifference, which depressed
Mary's heart. She often wished he would apply for relief from the
Guardian's relieving office; often wondered the Trades' Union did
nothing for him. Once when she asked him as he sat, grimed, unshaven,
and gaunt, after a day's fasting over the fire, why he did not get
relief from the town, he turned round, with grim wrath, and said, "I
don't want money, child! D----n their charity and their money! I want
work, and it is my right. I want work."

He would bear it all, he said to himself. And he did bear it, but
not meekly; that was too much to expect. Real meekness of character
is called out by experience of kindness. And few had been kind to
him. Yet through it all, with stern determination he refused the
assistance his Trades' Union would have given him. It had not much
to give, but with worldly wisdom, thought it better to propitiate
an active, useful member, than to help those who were unenergetic,
though they had large families to provide for. Not so thought John
Barton. With him need was right.

"Give it to Tom Darbyshire," he said. "He's more claim on it than me,
for he's more need of it, with his seven children."

Now Tom Darbyshire was, in his listless, grumbling way, a backbiting
enemy of John Barton's. And he knew it; but he was not to be
influenced by that in a matter like this.

Mary went early to her work; but her cheery laugh over it was now
missed by the other girls. Her mind wandered over the present
distress, and then settled, as she stitched, on the visions of the
future, where yet her thoughts dwelt more on the circumstances of
ease, and the pomps and vanities awaiting her, than on the lover
with whom she was to share them. Still she was not insensible to the
pride of having attracted one so far above herself in station; not
insensible to the secret pleasure of knowing that he, whom so many
admired, had often said he would give any thing for one of her sweet
smiles. Her love for him was a bubble, blown out of vanity; but it
looked very real and very bright. Sally Leadbitter, meanwhile, keenly
observed the signs of the times; she found out that Mary had begun to
affix a stern value to money as the "Purchaser of Life," and many
girls had been dazzled and lured by gold, even without the betraying
love which she believed to exist in Mary's heart. So she urged young
Mr. Carson, by representations of the want she was sure surrounded
Mary, to bring matters more to a point. But he had a kind of
instinctive dread of hurting Mary's pride of spirit, and durst not
hint his knowledge in any way of the distress that many must be
enduring. He felt that for the present he must still be content
with stolen meetings and summer evening strolls, and the delight of
pouring sweet honeyed words into her ear, while she listened with
a blush and a smile that made her look radiant with beauty. No,
he would be cautious in order to be certain; for Mary, one way or
another, he must make his. He had no doubt of the effect of his own
personal charms in the long run; for he knew he was handsome, and
believed himself fascinating.

If he had known what Mary's home was, he would not have been so much
convinced of his increasing influence over her, by her being more and
more ready to linger with him in the sweet summer air. For when she
returned for the night her father was often out, and the house wanted
the cheerful look it had had in the days when money was never wanted
to purchase soap and brushes, black-lead and pipe-clay. It was dingy
and comfortless; for, of course, there was not even the dumb familiar
home-friend, a fire. And Margaret, too, was now so often from home,
singing at some of those grand places. And Alice; oh, Mary wished
she had never left her cellar to go and live at Ancoats with her
sister-in-law. For in that matter Mary felt very guilty; she had put
off and put off going to see the widow after George Wilson's death
from dread of meeting Jem, or giving him reason to think she wished
to be as intimate with him as formerly; and now she was so much
ashamed of her delay that she was likely never to go at all.

If her father was at home it was no better; indeed it was worse. He
seldom spoke, less than ever; and often when he did speak they were
sharp angry words, such as he had never given her formerly. Her
temper was high, too, and her answers not over-mild; and once in his
passion he had even beaten her. If Sally Leadbitter or Mr. Carson had
been at hand at that moment, Mary would have been ready to leave home
for ever. She sat alone, after her father had flung out of the house,
bitterly thinking on the days that were gone; angry with her own
hastiness, and believing that her father did not love her; striving
to heap up one painful thought on another. Who cared for her? Mr.
Carson might, but in this grief that seemed no comfort. Mother dead!
Father so often angry, so lately cruel (for it was a hard blow, and
blistered and reddened Mary's soft white skin with pain): and then
her heart turned round, and she remembered with self-reproach how
provokingly she had looked and spoken, and how much her father had to
bear; and oh, what a kind and loving parent he had been, till these
days of trial. The remembrance of one little instance of his fatherly
love thronged after another into her mind, and she began to wonder
how she could have behaved to him as she had done.

Then he came home; and but for very shame she would have confessed
her penitence in words. But she looked sullen, from her effort to
keep down emotion; and for some time her father did not know how to
begin to speak. At length he gulped down pride, and said:

"Mary, I'm not above saying I'm very sorry I beat thee. Thou wert a
bit aggravating, and I'm not the man I was. But it were wrong, and
I'll try never to lay hands on thee again."

So he held out his arms, and in many tears she told him her
repentance for her fault. He never struck her again.

Still, he often was angry. But that was almost better than being
silent. Then he sat near the fire-place (from habit), smoking, or
chewing opium. Oh, how Mary loathed that smell! And in the dusk, just
before it merged into the short summer night, she had learned to look
with dread towards the window, which now her father would have kept
uncurtained; for there were not seldom seen sights which haunted her
in her dreams. Strange faces of pale men, with dark glaring eyes,
peered into the inner darkness, and seemed desirous to ascertain if
her father were at home. Or a hand and arm (the body hidden) was put
within the door, and beckoned him away. He always went. And once
or twice, when Mary was in bed, she heard men's voices below, in
earnest, whispered talk.

They were all desperate members of Trades' Unions, ready for any
thing; made ready by want.

While all this change for gloom yet struck fresh and heavy on Mary's
heart, her father startled her out of a reverie one evening, by
asking her when she had been to see Jane Wilson. From his manner of
speaking, she was made aware that he had been; but at the time of his
visit he had never mentioned any thing about it. Now, however, he
gruffly told her to go next day without fail, and added some abuse
of her for not having been before. The little outward impulse of
her father's speech gave Mary the push which she, in this instance,
required; and, accordingly, timing her visit so as to avoid Jem's
hours at home, she went the following afternoon to Ancoats.

The outside of the well-known house struck her as different; for
the door was closed, instead of open, as it once had always stood.
The window-plants, George Wilson's pride and especial care, looked
withering and drooping. They had been without water for a long time,
and now, when the widow had reproached herself severely for neglect,
in her ignorant anxiety, she gave them too much. On opening the door,
Alice was seen, not stirring about in her habitual way, but knitting
by the fire-side. The room felt hot, although the fire burnt gray
and dim, under the bright rays of the afternoon sun. Mrs. Wilson was
"siding" [39] the dinner things, and talking all the time, in a kind of
whining, shouting voice, which Mary did not at first understand.
She understood at once, however, that her absence had been noted,
and talked over; she saw a constrained look on Mrs. Wilson's
sorrow-stricken face, which told her a scolding was to come.


   [Footnote 39: To "side," to put aside, or in order.]


"Dear Mary, is that you?" she began. "Why, who would ha' dreamt of
seeing you! We thought you'd clean forgotten us; and Jem has often
wondered if he should know you, if he met you in the street."

Now, poor Jane Wilson had been sorely tried; and at present her
trials had had no outward effect, but that of increased acerbity of
temper. She wished to show Mary how much she was offended, and meant
to strengthen her cause, by putting some of her own sharp speeches
into Jem's mouth.

Mary felt guilty, and had no good reason to give as an apology; so
for a minute she stood silent, looking very much ashamed, and then
turned to speak to aunt Alice, who, in her surprised, hearty greeting
to Mary, had dropped her ball of worsted, and was busy trying to
set the thread to rights, before the kitten had entangled it past
redemption, once round every chair, and twice round the table.

"You mun speak louder than that, if you mean her to hear; she become
as deaf as a post this last few weeks. I'd ha' told you, if I'd
remembered how long it were sin' you'd seen her."

"Yes, my dear, I'm getting very hard o' hearing of late," said Alice,
catching the state of the case, with her quick-glancing eyes. "I
suppose it's the beginning of th' end."

"Don't talk o' that way," screamed her sister-in-law. "We've had enow
of ends and deaths without forecasting more." She covered her face
with her apron, and sat down to cry.

"He was such a good husband," said she, in a less excited tone, to
Mary, as she looked up with tear-streaming eyes from behind her
apron. "No one can tell what I've lost in him, for no one knew his
worth like me."

Mary's listening sympathy softened her, and she went on to unburden
her heavy laden heart.

"Eh, dear, dear! No one knows what I've lost. When my poor boys went,
I thought th' Almighty had crushed me to th' ground, but I never
thought o' losing George; I did na think I could ha' borne to ha'
lived without him. And yet I'm here, and he's--" A fresh burst of
crying interrupted her speech.

"Mary,"--beginning to speak again,--"did you ever hear what a poor
creature I were when he married me? And he such a handsome fellow!
Jem's nothing to what his father were at his age."

Yes! Mary had heard, and so she said. But the poor woman's thoughts
had gone back to those days, and her little recollections came out,
with many interruptions of sighs, and tears, and shakes of the head.

"There were nought about me for him to choose me. I were just well
enough afore that accident, but at after I were downright plain. And
there was Bessy Witter as would ha' given her eyes for him; she as is
Mrs. Carson now, for she were a handsome lass, although I never could
see her beauty then; and Carson warn't so much above her, as they're
both above us all now."

Mary went very red, and wished she could help doing so, and wished
also that Mrs. Wilson would tell her more about the father and mother
of her lover; but she durst not ask, and Mrs. Wilson's thoughts soon
returned to her husband, and their early married days.

"If you'll believe me, Mary, there never was such a born goose at
house-keeping as I were; and yet he married me! I had been in a
factory sin' five years old a'most, and I knew nought about cleaning,
or cooking, let alone washing and such-like work. The day after we
were married he goes to his work at after breakfast, and says he,
'Jenny, we'll ha' th' cold beef, and potatoes, and that's a dinner
fit for a prince.' I were anxious to make him comfortable, God knows
how anxious. And yet I'd no notion how to cook a potato. I know'd
they were boiled, and I know'd their skins were taken off, and that
were all. So I tidyed my house in a rough kind o' way, and then
I looked at that very clock up yonder," pointing at one that hung
against the wall, "and I seed it were nine o'clock, so, thinks I, th'
potatoes shall be well boiled at any rate, and I gets 'em on th' fire
in a jiffy (that's to say, as soon as I could peel 'em, which were a
tough job at first), and then I fell to unpacking my boxes! and at
twenty minutes past twelve he comes home, and I had th' beef ready on
th' table, and I went to take the potatoes out o' th' pot; but oh!
Mary, th' water had boiled away, and they were all a nasty brown
mass, as smelt through all the house. He said nought, and were very
gentle; but, oh, Mary, I cried so that afternoon. I shall ne'er
forget it; no, never. I made many a blunder at after, but none that
fretted me like that."

"Father does not like girls to work in factories," said Mary.

"No, I know he doesn't; and reason good. They oughtn't to go at
after they're married, that I'm very clear about. I could reckon up"
(counting with her fingers) "ay, nine men I know, as has been driven
to th' public-house by having wives as worked in factories; good
folk, too, as thought there was no harm in putting their little ones
out at nurse, and letting their house go all dirty, and their fires
all out; and that was a place as was tempting for a husband to stay
in, was it? He soon finds out gin-shops, where all is clean and
bright, and where th' fire blazes cheerily, and gives a man a welcome
as it were."

Alice, who was standing near for the convenience of hearing, had
caught much of this speech, and it was evident the subject had
previously been discussed by the women, for she chimed in.

"I wish our Jem could speak a word to th' Queen about factory work
for married women. Eh! but he comes it strong, when once yo get him
to speak about it. Wife o' his'n will never work away fra' home."

"I say it's Prince Albert as ought to be asked how he'd like his
missis to be from home when he comes in, tired and worn, and wanting
some one to cheer him; and may be, her to come in by-and-bye, just
as tired and down in th' mouth; and how he'd like for her never to
be at home to see to th' cleaning of his house, or to keep a bright
fire in his grate. Let alone his meals being all hugger-mugger and
comfortless. I'd be bound, prince as he is, if his missis served him
so, he'd be off to a gin-palace, or summut o' that kind. So why can't
he make a law again poor folks' wives working in factories?"

Mary ventured to say that she thought the Queen and Prince Albert
could not make laws, but the answer was,

"Pooh! don't tell me it's not the Queen as makes laws; and isn't she
bound to obey Prince Albert? And if he said they mustn't, why she'd
say they mustn't, and then all folk would say, oh no, we never shall
do any such thing no more."

"Jem's getten on rarely," said Alice, who had not heard her sister's
last burst of eloquence, and whose thoughts were still running on her
nephew, and his various talents. "He's found out summut about a crank
or a tank, I forget rightly which it is, but th' master's made him
foreman, and he all the while turning off hands; but he said he could
na part wi' Jem, nohow. He's good wage now: I tell him he'll be
thinking of marrying soon, and he deserves a right down good wife,
that he does."

Mary went very red, and looked annoyed, although there was a secret
spring of joy deep down in her heart, at hearing Jem so spoken of.
But his mother only saw the annoyed look, and was piqued accordingly.
She was not over and above desirous that her son should marry. His
presence in the house seemed a relic of happier times, and she had
some little jealousy of his future wife, whoever she might be. Still
she could not bear any one not to feel gratified and flattered by
Jem's preference, and full well she knew how above all others he
preferred Mary. Now she had never thought Mary good enough for Jem,
and her late neglect in coming to see her still rankled a little in
her breast. So she determined to invent a little, in order to do away
with any idea Mary might have that Jem would choose her for "his
right down good wife," as aunt Alice called it.

"Ay, he'll be for taking a wife soon," and then, in a lower voice,
as if confidentially, but really to prevent any contradiction or
explanation from her simple sister-in-law, she added,

"It'll not be long afore Molly Gibson (that's her at th'
provision-shop round the corner) will hear a secret as will not
displease her, I'm thinking. She's been casting sheep's eyes at our
Jem this many a day, but he thought her father would not give her
to a common working man; but now he's as good as her, every bit. I
thought once he'd a fancy for thee, Mary, but I donnot think yo'd
ever ha' suited, so it's best as it is."

By an effort Mary managed to keep down her vexation, and to say, "She
hoped he'd be happy with Molly Gibson. She was very handsome, for
certain."

"Ay, and a notable body, too. I'll just step up stairs and show you
the patchwork quilt she gave me but last Saturday."

Mary was glad she was going out of the room. Her words irritated her;
perhaps not the less because she did not fully believe them. Besides
she wanted to speak to Alice, and Mrs. Wilson seemed to think that
she, as the widow, ought to absorb all the attention.

"Dear Alice," began Mary, "I'm so grieved to find you so deaf; it
must have come on very rapid."

"Yes, dear, it's a trial; I'll not deny it. Pray God give me strength
to find out its teaching. I felt it sore one fine day when I thought
I'd go gather some meadow-sweet to make tea for Jane's cough; and
the fields seemed so dree and still, and at first I could na make
out what was wanting; and then it struck me it were th' song o' the
birds, and that I never should hear their sweet music no more, and I
could na help crying a bit. But I've much to be thankful for. I think
I'm a comfort to Jane, if I'm only some one to scold now and then;
poor body! It takes off her thoughts from her sore losses when she
can scold a bit. If my eyes are left I can do well enough; I can
guess at what folk are saying."

The splendid red and yellow patch quilt now made its appearance, and
Jane Wilson would not be satisfied unless Mary praised it all over,
border, centre, and ground-work, right side and wrong; and Mary did
her duty, saying all the more, because she could not work herself up
to any very hearty admiration of her rival's present. She made haste,
however, with her commendations, in order to avoid encountering
Jem. As soon as she was fairly away from the house and street, she
slackened her pace, and began to think. Did Jem really care for Molly
Gibson? Well, if he did, let him. People seemed all to think he was
much too good for her (Mary's own self). Perhaps some one else, far
more handsome, and far more grand, would show him one day that she
was good enough to be Mrs. Henry Carson. So temper, or what Mary
called "spirit," led her to encourage Mr. Carson more than ever she
had done before.

Some weeks after this, there was a meeting of the Trades' Union to
which John Barton belonged. The morning of the day on which it was to
take place he had lain late in bed, for what was the use of getting
up? He had hesitated between the purchase of meal or opium, and had
chosen the latter, for its use had become a necessity with him. He
wanted it to relieve him from the terrible depression its absence
occasioned. A large lump seemed only to bring him into a natural
state, or what had been his natural state formerly. Eight o'clock was
the hour fixed for the meeting; and at it were read letters, filled
with details of woe, from all parts of the country. Fierce, heavy
gloom brooded over the assembly; and fiercely and heavily did the men
separate, towards eleven o'clock, some irritated by the opposition of
others to their desperate plans.

It was not a night to cheer them, as they quitted the glare of the
gas-lighted room, and came out into the street. Unceasing, soaking
rain was falling; the very lamps seemed obscured by the damp upon
the glass, and their light reached but to a little distance from the
posts. The streets were cleared of passers-by; not a creature seemed
stirring, except here and there a drenched policeman in his oil-skin
cape. Barton wished the others good night, and set off home. He had
gone through a street or two, when he heard a step behind him; but he
did not care to look and see who it was. A little further, and the
person quickened step, and touched his arm very lightly. He turned,
and saw, even by the darkness visible of that badly-lighted street,
that the woman who stood by him was of no doubtful profession. It
was told by her faded finery, all unfit to meet the pelting of that
pitiless storm; the gauze bonnet, once pink, now dirty white; the
muslin gown, all draggled, and soaking wet up to the very knees; the
gay-coloured barège shawl, closely wrapped round the form, which yet
shivered and shook, as the woman whispered: "I want to speak to you."

He swore an oath, and bade her begone.

"I really do. Don't send me away. I'm so out of breath, I cannot say
what I would all at once." She put her hand to her side, and caught
her breath with evident pain.

"I tell thee I'm not the man for thee," adding an opprobrious name.
"Stay," said he, as a thought suggested by her voice flashed across
him. He gripped her arm--the arm he had just before shaken off, and
dragged her, faintly resisting, to the nearest lamp-post. He pushed
her bonnet back, and roughly held the face she would fain have
averted, to the light, and in her large, unnaturally bright gray
eyes, her lovely mouth, half open, as if imploring the forbearance
she could not ask for in words, he saw at once the long-lost Esther;
she who had caused his wife's death. Much was like the gay creature
of former years; but the glaring paint, the sharp features, the
changed expression of the whole! But most of all, he loathed the
dress; and yet the poor thing, out of her little choice of attire,
had put on the plainest she had, to come on that night's errand.

"So it's thee, is it! It's thee!" exclaimed John, as he ground his
teeth, and shook her with passion. "I've looked for thee long at
corners o' streets, and such like places. I knew I should find thee
at last. Thee'll may be bethink thee o' some words I spoke, which put
thee up at th' time; summut about street-walkers; but oh no! thou
art none o' them naughts; no one thinks thou art, who sees thy fine
draggle-tailed dress, and thy pretty pink cheeks!" stopping for very
want of breath.

"Oh, mercy! John, mercy! listen to me for Mary's sake!"

She meant his daughter, but the name only fell on his ear as
belonging to his wife; and it was adding fuel to the fire. In vain
did her face grow deadly pale round the vivid circle of paint, in
vain did she gasp for mercy,--he burst forth again.

"And thou names that name to me! and thou thinks the thought of her
will bring thee mercy! Dost thou know it was thee who killed her, as
sure as ever Cain killed Abel. She'd loved thee as her own, and she
trusted thee as her own, and when thou wert gone she never held up
head again, but died in less than a three week; and at the judgment
day she'll rise, and point to thee as her murderer; or if she don't,
I will."

He flung her, trembling, sickening, fainting, from him, and strode
away. She fell with a feeble scream against the lamp-post, and
lay there in her weakness, unable to rise. A policeman came up in
time to see the close of these occurrences, and concluding from
Esther's unsteady, reeling fall, that she was tipsy, he took her
in her half-unconscious state to the lock-ups for the night. The
superintendent of that abode of vice and misery was roused from his
dozing watch through the dark hours, by half-delirious wails and
moanings, which he reported as arising from intoxication. If he had
listened, he would have heard these words, repeated in various forms,
but always in the same anxious, muttering way.

"He would not listen to me; what can I do? He would not listen to me,
and I wanted to warn him! Oh, what shall I do to save Mary's child?
What shall I do? How can I keep her from being such a one as I am;
such a wretched, loathsome creature! She was listening just as I
listened, and loving just as I loved, and the end will be just like
my end. How shall I save her? She won't hearken to warning, or heed
it more than I did; and who loves her well enough to watch over her
as she should be watched? God keep her from harm! And yet I won't
pray for her; sinner that I am! Can my prayers be heard? No! they'll
only do harm. How shall I save her? He would not listen to me."

So the night wore away. The next morning she was taken up to the
New Bailey. It was a clear case of disorderly vagrancy, and she was
committed to prison for a month. How much might happen in that time!




CHAPTER XI.

MR. CARSON'S INTENTIONS REVEALED.


   "O Mary, canst thou wreck his peace,
     Wha for thy sake wad gladly die?
   Or canst thou break that heart of his,
     Whase only faut is loving thee?"

   BURNS.

   "I can like of the wealth, I must confess,
   Yet more I prize the man, though moneyless;
   I am not of their humour yet that can
   For title or estate affect a man;
   Or of myself one body deign to make
   With him I loathe, for his possessions' sake."

   WITHER'S "FIDELIA."


Barton returned home after his encounter with Esther, uneasy and
dissatisfied. He had said no more than he had been planning to say
for years, in case she was ever thrown in his way, in the character
in which he felt certain he should meet her. He believed she deserved
it all, and yet he now wished he had not said it. Her look, as she
asked for mercy, haunted him through his broken and disordered sleep;
her form, as he last saw her, lying prostrate in helplessness,
would not be banished from his dreams. He sat up in bed to try and
dispel the vision. Now, too late, his conscience smote him for his
harshness. It would have been all very well, he thought, to have said
what he did, if he had added some kind words, at last. He wondered
if his dead wife was conscious of that night's occurrence; and he
hoped not, for with her love for Esther he believed it would embitter
Heaven to have seen her so degraded and repulsed. For he now recalled
her humility, her tacit acknowledgment of her lost character; and he
began to marvel if there was power in the religion he had often heard
of, to turn her from her ways. He felt that no earthly power that he
knew of could do it, but there glimmered on his darkness the idea
that religion might save her. Still, where to find her again? In the
wilderness of a large town, where to meet with an individual of so
little value or note to any?

And evening after evening he paced those streets in which he had
heard her footsteps following him, peering under every fantastic,
discreditable bonnet, in the hopes of once more meeting Esther,
and addressing her in a far different manner from what he had done
before. But he returned, night after night, disappointed in his
search, and at last gave it up in despair, and tried to recall his
angry feelings towards her, in order to find relief from his present
self-reproach.

He often looked at Mary, and wished she were not so like her aunt,
for the very bodily likeness seemed to suggest the possibility of
a similar likeness in their fate; and then this idea enraged his
irritable mind, and he became suspicious and anxious about Mary's
conduct. Now hitherto she had been so remarkably free from all
control, and almost from all inquiry concerning her actions, that
she did not brook this change in her father's behaviour very well.
Just when she was yielding more than ever to Mr. Carson's desire of
frequent meetings, it was hard to be so questioned concerning her
hours of leaving off work, whether she had come straight home, &c.
She could not tell lies; though she could conceal much if she were
not questioned. So she took refuge in obstinate silence, alleging
as a reason for it her indignation at being so cross-examined. This
did not add to the good feeling between father and daughter, and yet
they dearly loved each other; and in the minds of each, one principal
reason for maintaining such behaviour as displeased the other, was
the believing that this conduct would insure that person's happiness.

Her father now began to wish Mary were married. Then this terrible
superstitious fear suggested by her likeness to Esther would be done
away with. He felt that he could not resume the reins he had once
slackened. But with a husband it would be different. If Jem Wilson
would but marry her! With his character for steadiness and talent!
But he was afraid Mary had slighted him, he came so seldom now to the
house. He would ask her.

"Mary, what's come o'er thee and Jem Wilson? Yo were great friends at
one time."

"Oh, folk say he's going to be married to Molly Gibson, and of course
courting takes up a deal o' time," answered Mary, as indifferently as
she could.

"Thou'st played thy cards badly, then," replied her father, in a
surly tone. "At one time he were desperate fond o' thee, or I'm much
mistaken. Much fonder of thee than thou deservedst."

"That's as people think," said Mary, pertly, for she remembered that
the very morning before she had met Mr. Carson, who had sighed, and
swore, and protested all manner of tender vows that she was the
loveliest, sweetest, best, &c. And when she had seen him afterwards
riding with one of his beautiful sisters, had he not evidently
pointed her out as in some way or other an object worthy of attention
and interest, and then lingered behind his sister's horse for a
moment to kiss his hand repeatedly. So, as for Jem Wilson, she could
whistle him down the wind.

But her father was not in the mood to put up with pertness, and he
upbraided her with the loss of Jem Wilson till she had to bite her
lips till the blood came, in order to keep down the angry words that
would rise in her heart. At last her father left the house, and then
she might give way to her passionate tears.

It so happened that Jem, after much anxious thought, had determined
that day to "put his fate to the touch, to win or lose it all." He
was in a condition to maintain a wife in comfort. It was true his
mother and aunt must form part of the household; but such is not an
uncommon case among the poor, and if there were the advantage of
previous friendship between the parties, it was not, he thought, an
obstacle to matrimony. Both mother and aunt he believed would welcome
Mary. And oh! what a certainty of happiness the idea of that welcome
implied.

He had been absent and abstracted all day long with the thought of
the coming event of the evening. He almost smiled at himself for his
care in washing and dressing in preparation for his visit to Mary. As
if one waistcoat or another could decide his fate in so passionately
momentous a thing. He believed he only delayed before his little
looking-glass for cowardice, for absolute fear of a girl. He would
try not to think so much about the affair, and he thought the more.

Poor Jem! it is not an auspicious moment for thee!

"Come in," said Mary, as some one knocked at the door, while she sat
sadly at her sewing, trying to earn a few pence by working over hours
at some mourning.

Jem entered, looking more awkward and abashed than he had ever done
before. Yet here was Mary all alone, just as he had hoped to find
her. She did not ask him to take a chair, but after standing a minute
or two he sat down near her.

"Is your father at home, Mary?" said he, by way of making an opening,
for she seemed determined to keep silence, and went on stitching
away.

"No, he's gone to his Union, I suppose." Another silence. It was no
use waiting, thought Jem. The subject would never be led to by any
talk he could think of in his anxious fluttered state. He had better
begin at once.

"Mary!" said he, and the unusual tone of his voice made her look up
for an instant, but in that time she understood from his countenance
what was coming, and her heart beat so suddenly and violently she
could hardly sit still. Yet one thing she was sure of; nothing he
could say should make her have him. She would show them all _who_
would be glad to have her. She was not yet calm after her father's
irritating speeches. Yet her eyes fell veiled before that passionate
look fixed upon her.

"Dear Mary! (for how dear you are, I cannot rightly tell you in
words). It's no new story I'm going to speak about. You must ha' seen
and known it long; for since we were boy and girl, I ha' loved you
above father and mother and all; and all I've thought on by day and
dreamt on by night, has been something in which you've had a share.
I'd no way of keeping you for long, and I scorned to try and tie you
down; and I lived in terror lest some one else should take you to
himself. But now, Mary, I'm foreman in th' works, and, dear Mary!
listen," as she, in her unbearable agitation, stood up and turned
away from him. He rose, too, and came nearer, trying to take hold of
her hand; but this she would not allow. She was bracing herself up to
refuse him, for once and for all.

"And now, Mary, I've a home to offer you, and a heart as true as ever
man had to love you and cherish you; we shall never be rich folk,
I dare say; but if a loving heart and a strong right arm can shield
you from sorrow, or from want, mine shall do it. I cannot speak
as I would like; my love won't let itself be put in words. But oh!
darling, say you believe me, and that you'll be mine."

She could not speak at once; her words would not come.

"Mary, they say silence gives consent; is it so?" he whispered.

Now or never the effort must be made.

"No! it does not with me." Her voice was calm, although she trembled
from head to foot. "I will always be your friend, Jem, but I can
never be your wife."

"Not my wife!" said he, mournfully. "Oh Mary, think awhile! you
cannot be my friend if you will not be my wife. At least I can never
be content to be only your friend. Do think awhile! If you say No you
will make me hopeless, desperate. It's no love of yesterday. It has
made the very groundwork of all that people call good in me. I don't
know what I shall be if you won't have me. And, Mary! think how glad
your father would be! it may sound vain, but he's told me more than
once how much he should like to see us two married!"

Jem intended this for a powerful argument, but in Mary's present mood
it told against him more than any thing; for it suggested the false
and foolish idea, that her father, in his evident anxiety to promote
her marriage with Jem, had been speaking to him on the subject with
some degree of solicitation.

"I tell you, Jem, it cannot be. Once for all, I will never marry
you."

"And is this the end of all my hopes and fears? the end of my life,
I may say, for it is the end of all worth living for!" His agitation
rose and carried him into passion. "Mary! you'll hear, may be, of
me as a drunkard, and may be as a thief, and may be as a murderer.
Remember! when all are speaking ill of me, you will have no right to
blame me, for it's your cruelty that will have made me what I feel
I shall become. You won't even say you'll try and like me; will you,
Mary?" said he, suddenly changing his tone from threatening despair
to fond passionate entreaty, as he took her hand and held it forcibly
between both of his, while he tried to catch a glimpse of her averted
face. She was silent, but it was from deep and violent emotion. He
could not bear to wait; he would not hope, to be dashed away again;
he rather in his bitterness of heart chose the certainty of despair,
and before she could resolve what to answer, he flung away her hand
and rushed out of the house.

"Jem! Jem!" cried she, with faint and choking voice. It was too late;
he left street after street behind him with his almost winged speed,
as he sought the fields, where he might give way unobserved to all
the deep despair he felt.

It was scarcely ten minutes since he had entered the house, and found
Mary at comparative peace, and now she lay half across the dresser,
her head hidden in her hands, and every part of her body shaking with
the violence of her sobs. She could not have told at first (if you
had asked her, and she could have commanded voice enough to answer)
why she was in such agonised grief. It was too sudden for her to
analyse, or think upon it. She only felt that by her own doing her
life would be hereafter dreary and blank. By-and-bye her sorrow
exhausted her body by its power, and she seemed to have no strength
left for crying. She sat down; and now thoughts crowded on her mind.
One little hour ago, and all was still unsaid, and she had her fate
in her own power. And yet, how long ago had she determined to say
pretty much what she did, if the occasion ever offered.

It was as if two people were arguing the matter; that mournful,
desponding communion between her former self and her present self.
Herself, a day, an hour ago; and herself now. For we have every one
of us felt how a very few minutes of the months and years called
life, will sometimes suffice to place all time past and future in an
entirely new light; will make us see the vanity or the criminality
of the bye-gone, and so change the aspect of the coming time, that
we look with loathing on the very thing we have most desired. A
few moments may change our character for life, by giving a totally
different direction to our aims and energies.

To return to Mary. Her plan had been, as we well know, to marry Mr.
Carson, and the occurrence an hour ago was only a preliminary step.
True; but it had unveiled her heart to her; it had convinced her she
loved Jem above all persons or things. But Jem was a poor mechanic,
with a mother and aunt to keep; a mother, too, who had shown her
pretty clearly she did not desire her for a daughter-in-law: while
Mr. Carson was rich, and prosperous, and gay, and (she believed)
would place her in all circumstances of ease and luxury, where want
could never come. What were these hollow vanities to her, now she
had discovered the passionate secret of her soul? She felt as if she
almost hated Mr. Carson, who had decoyed her with his baubles. She
now saw how vain, how nothing to her, would be all gaieties and
pomps, all joys and pleasures, unless she might share them with Jem;
yes, with him she harshly rejected so short a time ago. If he were
poor, she loved him all the better. If his mother did think her
unworthy of him, what was it but the truth, as she now owned with
bitter penitence. She had hitherto been walking in grope-light
towards a precipice; but in the clear revelation of that past hour,
she saw her danger, and turned away resolutely and for ever.

That was some comfort: I mean her clear perception of what she ought
not to do; of what no luring temptation should ever again induce her
to hearken to. How she could best undo the wrong she had done to Jem
and herself by refusing his love, was another anxious question. She
wearied herself with proposing plans, and rejecting them.

She was roused to a consciousness of time by hearing the neighbouring
church clock strike twelve. Her father she knew might be expected
home any minute, and she was in no mood for a meeting with him.
So she hastily gathered up her work, and went to her own little
bed-room, leaving him to let himself in.

She put out her candle, that her father might not see its light under
the door; and sat down on her bed to think. But after turning things
over in her mind again and again, she could only determine at once
to put an end to all further communication with Mr. Carson, in the
most decided way she could. Maidenly modesty (and true love is ever
modest) seemed to oppose every plan she could think of, for showing
Jem how much she repented her decision against him, and how dearly
she had now discovered that she loved him. She came to the unusual
wisdom of resolving to do nothing, but try and be patient, and
improve circumstances as they might turn up. Surely, if Jem knew of
her remaining unmarried, he would try his fortune again. He would
never be content with one rejection; she believed she could not
in his place. She had been very wrong, but now she would try and
do right, and have womanly patience, until he saw her changed and
repentant mind in her natural actions. Even if she had to wait for
years, it was no more than now it was easy to look forward to, as a
penance for her giddy flirting on the one hand, and her cruel mistake
concerning her feelings on the other. So anticipating a happy ending
to the course of her love, however distant it might be, she fell
asleep just as the earliest factory bells were ringing. She had sunk
down in her clothes, and her sleep was unrefreshing. She wakened up
shivery and chill in body, and sorrow-stricken in mind, though she
could not at first rightly tell the cause of her depression.

She recalled the events of the night before, and still resolved to
adhere to those determinations she had then formed. But patience
seemed a far more difficult virtue this morning.

She hastened down-stairs, and in her earnest sad desire to do right,
now took much pains to secure a comfortable though scanty breakfast
for her father; and when he dawdled into the room, in an evidently
irritable temper, she bore all with the gentleness of penitence, till
at last her mild answers turned away wrath.

She loathed the idea of meeting Sally Leadbitter at her daily
work; yet it must be done, and she tried to nerve herself for the
encounter, and to make it at once understood, that having determined
to give up having any thing further to do with Mr. Carson, she
considered the bond of intimacy broken between them.

But Sally was not the person to let these resolutions be carried
into effect too easily. She soon became aware of the present state
of Mary's feelings, but she thought they merely arose from the
changeableness of girlhood, and that the time would come when Mary
would thank her for almost forcing her to keep up her meetings and
communications with her rich lover.

So, when two days had passed over in rather too marked avoidance
of Sally on Mary's part, and when the former was made aware by Mr.
Carson's complaints that Mary was not keeping her appointments with
him, and that unless he detained her by force, he had no chance of
obtaining a word as she passed him in the street on her rapid walk
home, she resolved to compel Mary to what she called her own good.

She took no notice during the third day of Mary's avoidance as they
sat at work; she rather seemed to acquiesce in the coolness of their
intercourse. She put away her sewing early, and went home to her
mother, who, she said, was more ailing than usual. The other girls
soon followed her example, and Mary, casting a rapid glance up and
down the street, as she stood last on Miss Simmonds' door-step,
darted homewards, in hopes of avoiding the person whom she was fast
learning to dread. That night she was safe from any encounter on
her road, and she arrived at home, which she found as she expected,
empty; for she knew it was a club night, which her father would not
miss. She sat down to recover breath, and to still her heart, which
panted more from nervousness than from over-exertion, although she
had walked so quickly. Then she rose, and taking off her bonnet, her
eye caught the form of Sally Leadbitter passing the window with a
lingering step, and looking into the darkness with all her might, as
if to ascertain if Mary were returned. In an instant she re-passed
and knocked at the house-door, but without awaiting an answer, she
entered.

"Well, Mary, dear" (knowing well how little "dear" Mary considered
her just then); "i's so difficult to get any comfortable talk at Miss
Simmonds', I thought I'd just step up and see you at home."

"I understood from what you said your mother was ailing, and that you
wanted to be with her," replied Mary, in no welcoming tone.

"Ay, but mother's better now," said the unabashed Sally. "Your
father's out I suppose?" looking round as well as she could; for Mary
made no haste to perform the hospitable offices of striking a match,
and lighting a candle.

"Yes, he's out," said Mary, shortly, and busying herself at last
about the candle, without ever asking her visitor to sit down.

"So much the better," answered Sally, "for to tell you the truth,
Mary, I've a friend at th' end of the street, as is anxious to come
and see you at home, since you're grown so particular as not to like
to speak to him in the street. He'll be here directly."

"Oh, Sally, don't let him," said Mary, speaking at last heartily; and
running to the door she would have fastened it, but Sally held her
hands, laughing meanwhile at her distress.

"Oh, please, Sally," struggling, "dear Sally! don't let him come
here, the neighbours will so talk, and father'll go mad if he hears;
he'll kill me, Sally, he will. Besides, I don't love him--I never
did. Oh, let me go," as footsteps approached; and then, as they
passed the house, and seemed to give her a respite, she continued,
"Do, Sally, dear Sally, go and tell him I don't love him, and that I
don't want to have any thing more to do with him. It was very wrong,
I dare say, keeping company with him at all, but I'm very sorry, if
I've led him to think too much of me; and I don't want him to think
any more. Will you tell him this, Sally? and I'll do any thing for
you if you will."

"I'll tell you what I'll do," said Sally, in a more relenting mood,
"I'll go back with you to where he's waiting for us; or rather, I
should say, where I told him to wait for a quarter of an hour, till
I seed if your father was at home; and if I didn't come back in that
time, he said he'd come here, and break the door open but he'd see
you."

"Oh, let us go, let us go," said Mary, feeling that the interview
must be, and had better be anywhere than at home, where her father
might return at any minute. She snatched up her bonnet, and was at
the end of the court in an instant; but then, not knowing whether to
turn to the right or to the left, she was obliged to wait for Sally,
who came leisurely up, and put her arm through Mary's, with a kind of
decided hold, intended to prevent the possibility of her changing her
mind, and turning back. But this, under the circumstances, was quite
different to Mary's plan. She had wondered more than once if she must
not have another interview with Mr. Carson; and had then determined,
while she expressed her resolution that it should be the final one,
to tell him how sorry she was if she had thoughtlessly given him
false hopes. For be it remembered, she had the innocence, or the
ignorance, to believe his intentions honourable; and he, feeling
that at any price he must have her, only that he would obtain her as
cheaply as he could, had never undeceived her; while Sally Leadbitter
laughed in her sleeve at them both, and wondered how it would all
end,--whether Mary would gain her point of marriage, with her sly
affectation of believing such to be Mr. Carson's intention in
courting her.

Not very far from the end of the street, into which the court where
Mary lived opened, they met Mr. Carson, his hat a good deal slouched
over his face as if afraid of being recognised. He turned when he saw
them coming, and led the way without uttering a word (although they
were close behind) to a street of half-finished houses.

The length of the walk gave Mary time to recoil from the interview
which was to follow; but even if her own resolve to go through with
it had failed, there was the steady grasp of Sally Leadbitter, which
she could not evade without an absolute struggle.

At last he stopped in the shelter and concealment of a wooden
fence, put up to keep the building rubbish from intruding on the
foot-pavement. Inside this fence, a minute afterwards, the girls were
standing by him; Mary now returning Sally's detaining grasp with
interest, for she had determined on the way to make her a witness,
willing or unwilling, to the ensuing conversation. But Sally's
curiosity led her to be a very passive prisoner in Mary's hold.

With more freedom than he had ever used before, Mr. Carson put his
arm firmly round Mary's waist, in spite of her indignant resistance.

"Nay, nay! you little witch! Now I have caught you, I shall keep you
prisoner. Tell me now what has made you run away from me so fast
these few days--tell me, you sweet little coquette!"

Mary ceased struggling, but turned so as to be almost opposite to
him, while she spoke out calmly and boldly,

"Mr. Carson! I want to speak to you for once and for all. Since I met
you last Monday evening, I have made up my mind to have nothing more
to do with you. I know I've been wrong in leading you to think I
liked you; but I believe I didn't rightly know my own mind; and I
humbly beg your pardon, sir, if I've led you to think too much of
me."

For an instant he was surprised; the next, vanity came to his
aid, and convinced him that she could only be joking. He, young,
agreeable, rich, handsome! No! she was only showing a little womanly
fondness for coquetting.

"You're a darling little rascal to go on in this way! 'Humbly begging
my pardon if you've made me think too much of you.' As if you didn't
know I think of you from morning to night. But you want to be told it
again and again, do you?"

"No, indeed, sir, I don't. I would far liefer [40] that you should
say you will never think of me again, than that you should speak of
me in this way. For indeed, sir, I never was more in earnest than I
am, when I say to-night is the last night I will ever speak to you."


   [Footnote 40: "Liefer," rather.
                 "Yet had I _levre_ unwist for sorrow die."
                 _Chaucer; "Troilus and Creseide."_]


"Last night, you sweet little equivocator, but not last day. Ha,
Mary! I've caught you, have I?" as she, puzzled by his perseverance
in thinking her joking, hesitated in what form she could now put her
meaning.

"I mean, sir," she said, sharply, "that I will never speak to you
again at any time, after to-night."

"And what's made this change, Mary?" said he, seriously enough now.
"Have I done any thing to offend you?" added he, earnestly.

"No, sir," she answered gently, but yet firmly. "I cannot tell you
exactly why I've changed my mind; but I shall not alter it again; and
as I said before, I beg your pardon if I've done wrong by you. And
now, sir, if you please, good night."

"But I do not please. You shall not go. What have I done, Mary? Tell
me. You must not go without telling me how I have vexed you. What
would you have me do?"

"Nothing, sir! but (in an agitated tone) oh! let me go! You cannot
change my mind; it's quite made up. Oh, sir! why do you hold me so
tight? If you _will_ know why I won't have any thing more to do
with you, it is that I cannot love you. I have tried, and I really
cannot."

This naive and candid avowal served her but little. He could not
understand how it could be true. Some reason lurked behind. He was
passionately in love. What should he do to tempt her? A thought
struck him.

"Listen! Mary. Nay, I cannot let you go till you have heard me. I
do love you dearly; and I won't believe but what you love me a very
little, just a very little. Well, if you don't like to own it, never
mind! I only want now to tell you how much I love you, by what I am
ready to give up for you. You know (or perhaps you are not fully
aware) how little my father and mother would like me to marry you.
So angry would they be, and so much ridicule should I have to brave,
that of course I have never thought of it till now. I thought we
could be happy enough without marriage." (Deep sank those words into
Mary's heart.) "But now, if you like, I'll get a licence to-morrow
morning--nay, to-night, and I'll marry you in defiance of all the
world, rather than give you up. In a year or two my father will
forgive me, and meanwhile you shall have every luxury money can
purchase, and every charm that love can devise to make your life
happy. After all, my mother was but a factory girl." (This was said
half to himself, as if to reconcile himself to this bold step.) "Now,
Mary, you see how willing I am to--to sacrifice a good deal for you;
I even offer you marriage, to satisfy your little ambitious heart;
so, now, won't you say you can love me a little, little bit?"

He pulled her towards him. To his surprise, she still resisted. Yes!
though all she had pictured to herself for so many months in being
the wife of Mr. Carson was now within her grasp, she resisted. His
speech had given her but one feeling, that of exceeding great relief.
For she had dreaded, now she knew what true love was, to think of
the attachment she might have created; the deep feeling her flirting
conduct might have called out. She had loaded herself with reproaches
for the misery she might have caused. It was a relief to gather that
the attachment was of that low, despicable kind, which can plan to
seduce the object of its affection; that the feeling she had caused
was shallow enough, for it only pretended to embrace self, at the
expense of the misery, the ruin, of one falsely termed beloved. She
need not be penitent to such a plotter! That was the relief.

"I am obliged to you, sir, for telling me what you have. You may
think I am a fool; but I did think you meant to marry me all along;
and yet, thinking so, I felt I could not love you. Still I felt sorry
I had gone so far in keeping company with you. Now, sir, I tell you,
if I had loved you before, I don't think I should have loved you now
you have told me you meant to ruin me; for that's the plain English
of not meaning to marry me till just this minute. I said I was sorry,
and humbly begged your pardon; that was before I knew what you were.
Now I scorn you, sir, for plotting to ruin a poor girl. Good night."

And with a wrench, for which she had reserved all her strength, she
was off like a bolt. They heard her flying footsteps echo down the
quiet street. The next sound was Sally's laugh, which grated on Mr.
Carson's ears, and keenly irritated him.

"And what do you find so amusing, Sally?" asked he.

"Oh, sir, I beg your pardon. I humbly beg your pardon, as Mary says,
but I can't help laughing, to think how she's outwitted us." (She was
going to have said, "outwitted you," but changed the pronoun.)

"Why, Sally, had you any idea she was going to fly out in this
style?"

"No, I hadn't, to be sure. But if you did think of marrying her, why
(if I may be so bold as to ask) did you go and tell her you had no
thought of doing otherwise by her? That was what put her up at last!"

"Why I had repeatedly before led her to infer that marriage was not
my object. I never dreamed she could have been so foolish as to have
mistaken me, little provoking romancer though she be! So I naturally
wished her to know what a sacrifice of prejudice, of--of myself, in
short, I was willing to make for her sake; yet I don't think she was
aware of it after all. I believe I might have any lady in Manchester
if I liked, and yet I was willing and ready to marry a poor
dress-maker. Don't you understand me now? and don't you see what a
sacrifice I was making to humour her? and all to no avail."

Sally was silent, so he went on:

"My father would have forgiven any temporary connexion, far sooner
than my marrying one so far beneath me in rank."

"I thought you said, sir, your mother was a factory girl," reminded
Sally, rather maliciously.

"Yes, yes!--but then my father was in much such a station; at any
rate, there was not the disparity there is between Mary and me."

Another pause.

"Then you mean to give her up, sir? She made no bones of saying she
gave you up."

"No, I do not mean to give her up, whatever you and she may please to
think. I am more in love with her than ever; even for this charming
capricious ebullition of hers. She'll come round, you may depend upon
it. Women always do. They always have second thoughts, and find out
that they are best in casting off a lover. Mind! I don't say I shall
offer her the same terms again."

With a few more words of no importance, the allies parted.




CHAPTER XII.

OLD ALICE'S BAIRN.


   "I lov'd him not; and yet, now he is gone,
       I feel I am alone.
   I check'd him while he spoke; yet, could he speak,
       Alas! I would not check.
   For reasons not to love him once I sought,
       And wearied all my thought."

   W. S. LANDOR.


And now Mary had, as she thought, dismissed both her lovers. But they
looked on their dismissals with very different eyes. He who loved her
with all his heart and with all his soul, considered his rejection
final. He did not comfort himself with the idea, which would have
proved so well founded in his case, that women have second thoughts
about casting off their lovers. He had too much respect for his
own heartiness of love to believe himself unworthy of Mary; that
mock humble conceit did not enter his head. He thought he did not
"hit Mary's fancy;" and though that may sound a trivial every-day
expression, yet the reality of it cut him to the heart. Wild visions
of enlistment, of drinking himself into forgetfulness, of becoming
desperate in some way or another, entered his mind; but then the
thought of his mother stood like an angel with a drawn sword in the
way to sin. For, you know, "he was the only son of his mother, and
she was a widow;" dependent on him for daily bread. So he could not
squander away health and time, which were to him money wherewith to
support her failing years. He went to his work, accordingly, to all
outward semblance just as usual; but with a heavy, heavy heart
within.

Mr. Carson, as we have seen, persevered in considering Mary's
rejection of him as merely a "charming caprice." If she were at work,
Sally Leadbitter was sure to slip a passionately loving note into her
hand, and then so skilfully move away from her side, that Mary could
not all at once return it, without making some sensation among the
work-women. She was even forced to take several home with her. But
after reading one, she determined on her plan. She made no great
resistance to receiving them from Sally, but kept them unopened, and
occasionally returned them in a blank half-sheet of paper. But far
worse than this, was the being so constantly waylaid as she went home
by her persevering lover; who had been so long acquainted with all
her habits, that she found it difficult to evade him. Late or early,
she was never certain of being free from him. Go this way or that,
he might come up some cross street when she had just congratulated
herself on evading him for that day. He could not have taken a surer
mode of making himself odious to her.

And all this time Jem Wilson never came! Not to see her--that she did
not expect--but to see her father; to--she did not know what, but
she had hoped he would have come on some excuse, just to see if she
hadn't changed her mind. He never came. Then she grew weary and
impatient, and her spirits sank. The persecution of the one lover,
and the neglect of the other, oppressed her sorely. She could not now
sit quietly through the evening at her work; or, if she kept, by a
strong effort, from pacing up and down the room, she felt as if she
must sing to keep off thought while she sewed. And her songs were
the maddest, merriest, she could think of. "Barbara Allen," and such
sorrowful ditties, did well enough for happy times; but now she
required all the aid that could be derived from external excitement
to keep down the impulse of grief.

And her father, too--he was a great anxiety to her, he looked so
changed and so ill. Yet he would not acknowledge to any ailment. She
knew, that be it as late as it would, she never left off work until
(if the poor servants paid her pretty regularly for the odd jobs of
mending she did for them) she had earned a few pence, enough for one
good meal for her father on the next day. But very frequently all she
could do in the morning, after her late sitting up at night, was to
run with the work home, and receive the money from the person for
whom it was done. She could not stay often to make purchases of food,
but gave up the money at once to her father's eager clutch; sometimes
prompted by savage hunger it is true, but more frequently by a
craving for opium.

On the whole he was not so hungry as his daughter. For it was a long
fast from the one o'clock dinner-hour at Miss Simmonds' to the close
of Mary's vigil, which was often extended to midnight. She was young,
and had not yet learned to bear "clemming."

One evening, as she sang a merry song over her work, stopping
occasionally to sigh, the blind Margaret came groping in. It had been
one of Mary's additional sorrows that her friend had been absent
from home, accompanying the lecturer on music in his round among the
manufacturing towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire. Her grandfather,
too, had seen this a good time for going his expeditions in search of
specimens; so that the house had been shut up for several weeks.

"Oh! Margaret, Margaret! how glad I am to see you. Take care. There,
now, you're all right, that's father's chair. Sit down."--She kissed
her over and over again.

"It seems like the beginning o' brighter times, to see you again,
Margaret. Bless you! And how well you look!"

"Doctors always send ailing folk for change of air! and you know I've
had plenty o' that same lately."

"You've been quite a traveller for sure! Tell us all about it, do,
Margaret. Where have you been to, first place?"

"Eh, lass, that would take a long time to tell. Half o'er the world I
sometimes think. Bolton, and Bury, and Owdham, and Halifax, and--but
Mary, guess who I saw there! May be you know though, so it's not fair
guessing."

"No, I donnot. Tell me, Margaret, for I cannot abide waiting and
guessing."

"Well, one night as I were going fra' my lodgings wi' the help on a
lad as belonged to th' landlady, to find the room where I were to
sing, I heard a cough before me, walking along. Thinks I, that's Jem
Wilson's cough, or I'm much mistaken. Next time came a sneeze and a
cough, and then I were certain. First I hesitated whether I should
speak, thinking if it were a stranger he'd may be think me forrard.
[41] But I knew blind folks must not be nesh about using their
tongues, so says I, 'Jem Wilson, is that you?' And sure enough it
was, and nobody else. Did you know he were in Halifax, Mary?"


   [Footnote 41: "Forrard," forward.]


"No;" she answered, faintly and sadly; for Halifax was all the
same to her heart as the Antipodes; equally inaccessible by humble
penitent looks and maidenly tokens of love.

"Well, he's there, however; he's putting up an engine for some folks
there, for his master. He's doing well, for he's getten four or five
men under him; we'd two or three meetings, and he telled me all about
his invention for doing away wi' the crank, or somewhat. His master's
bought it from him, and ta'en out a patent, and Jem's a gentleman
for life wi' the money his master gied him. But you'll ha' heard all
this, Mary?"

No! she had not.

"Well, I thought it all happened afore he left Manchester, and then
in course you'd ha' known. But may be it were all settled after he
got to Halifax; however, he's gotten two or three hunder pounds for
his invention. But what's up with you, Mary? you're sadly out o'
sorts. You've never been quarrelling wi' Jem, surely?"

Now Mary cried outright; she was weak in body, and unhappy in mind,
and the time was come when she might have the relief of telling her
grief. She could not bring herself to confess how much of her sorrow
was caused by her having been vain and foolish; she hoped that need
never be known, and she could not bear to think of it.

"Oh, Margaret; do you know Jem came here one night when I were put
out, and cross. Oh, dear! dear! I could bite my tongue out when I
think on it. And he told me how he loved me, and I thought I did not
love him, and I told him I didn't; and, Margaret,--he believed me,
and went away so sad, and so angry; and now I'd do any thing,--I
would, indeed," her sobs choked the end of her sentence. Margaret
looked at her with sorrow, but with hope; for she had no doubt in her
own mind, that it was only a temporary estrangement.

"Tell me, Margaret," said Mary, taking her apron down from her eyes,
and looking at Margaret with eager anxiety, "what can I do to bring
him back to me? Should I write to him?"

"No," replied her friend, "that would not do. Men are so queer, they
like to have a' the courting to themselves."

"But I did not mean to write him a courting letter," said Mary,
somewhat indignantly.

"If you wrote at all, it would be to give him a hint you'd taken
the rue, and would be very glad to have him now. I believe now he'd
rather find that out himself."

"But he won't try," said Mary, sighing. "How can he find it out when
he's at Halifax?"

"If he's a will he's a way, depend upon it. And you would not have
him if he's not a will to you, Mary! No, dear!" changing her tone
from the somewhat hard way in which sensible people too often speak,
to the soft accents of tenderness which come with such peculiar grace
from them; "you must just wait and be patient. You may depend upon
it, all will end well, and better than if you meddled in it now."

"But it's so hard to be patient," pleaded Mary.

"Ay, dear; being patient is the hardest work we, any on us, have
to do through life, I take it. Waiting is far more difficult than
doing. I've known that about my sight, and many a one has known it in
watching the sick; but it's one of God's lessons we all must learn,
one way or another." After a pause. "Have ye been to see his mother
of late?"

"No; not for some weeks. When last I went she was so frabbit [42]
with me, that I really thought she wished I'd keep away."


   [Footnote 42: "Frabbit," ill-tempered.]


"Well! if I were you I'd go. Jem will hear on't, and it will do you
far more good in his mind than writing a letter, which, after all,
you would find a tough piece of work when you came to settle to it.
'Twould be hard to say neither too much nor too little. But I must be
going, grandfather is at home, and it's our first night together, and
he must not be sitting wanting me any longer."

She rose up from her seat, but still delayed going.

"Mary! I've somewhat else I want to say to you, and I don't rightly
know how to begin. You see, grandfather and I know what bad times is,
and we know your father is out o' work, and I'm getting more money
than I can well manage; and, dear, would you just take this bit o'
gold, and pay me back in good times?" The tears stood in Margaret's
eyes as she spoke.

"Dear Margaret, we're not so bad pressed as that." (The thought of
her father, and his ill looks, and his one meal a day, rushed upon
Mary.) "And yet, dear, if it would not put you out o' your way,--I
would work hard to make it up to you;--but would not your grandfather
be vexed?"

"Not he, wench! It were more his thought than mine, and we have
gotten ever so many more at home, so don't hurry yoursel about
paying. It's hard to be blind, to be sure, else money comes in so
easily now to what it used to do; and it's downright pleasure to earn
it, for I do so like singing."

"I wish I could sing," said Mary, looking at the sovereign.

"Some has one kind o' gifts, and some another. Many's the time when
I could see, that I longed for your beauty, Mary! We're like childer,
ever wanting what we han not got. But now I must say just one more
word. Remember, if you're sore pressed for money, we shall take it
very unkind if you donnot let us know. Good bye to ye."

In spite of her blindness she hurried away, anxious to rejoin her
grandfather, and desirous also to escape from Mary's expressions of
gratitude.

Her visit had done Mary good in many ways. It had strengthened her
patience and her hope. It had given her confidence in Margaret's
sympathy; and last, and really least in comforting power (of so
little value are silver and gold in comparison to love, that gift
in every one's power to bestow), came the consciousness of the
money-value of the sovereign she held in her hand. The many things it
might purchase! First of all came the thought of a comfortable supper
for her father that very night; and acting instantly upon the idea,
she set off in hopes that all the provision-shops might not yet be
closed, although it was so late.

That night the cottage shone with unusual light, and fire-gleam;
and the father and daughter sat down to a meal they thought almost
extravagant. It was so long since they had had enough to eat.

"Food gives heart," say the Lancashire people; and the next day Mary
made time to go and call on Mrs. Wilson, according to Margaret's
advice. She found her quite alone, and more gracious than she had
been the last time Mary had visited her. Alice was gone out, she
said.

"She would just step to the post-office, all for no earthly use. For
it were to ask if they hadn't a letter lying there for her from her
foster-son Will Wilson, the sailor-lad."

"What made her think there were a letter?" asked Mary.

"Why, yo see, a neighbour as has been in Liverpool, telled us Will's
ship were come in. Now he said last time he were in Liverpool he'd
ha' come to ha' seen Alice, but his ship had but a week holiday, and
hard work for the men in that time too. So Alice makes sure he'll
come this, and has had her hand behind her ear at every noise in th'
street, thinking it were him. And to-day she were neither to have nor
to hold, but off she would go to th' post, and see if he had na sent
her a line to th' old house near yo. I tried to get her to give up
going, for let alone her deafness she's getten so dark, she cannot
see five yards afore her; but no, she would go, poor old body."

"I did not know her sight had failed her; she used to have good eyes
enough when she lived near us."

"Ay, but it's gone lately a good deal. But you never ask after Jem--"
anxious to get in a word on the subject nearest her heart.

"No," replied Mary, blushing scarlet. "How is he?"

"I cannot justly say how he is, seeing he's at Halifax; but he were
very well when he wrote last Tuesday. Han ye heard o' his good luck?"

Rather to her disappointment, Mary owned she had heard of the sum his
master had paid him for his invention.

"Well! and did not Margaret tell yo what he'd done wi' it? It's just
like him though, ne'er to say a word about it. Why, when it were paid
what does he do, but get his master to help him to buy an income for
me and Alice. He had her name put down for her life; but, poor thing,
she'll not be long to the fore, I'm thinking. She's sadly failed of
late. And so, Mary, yo see, we're two ladies o' property. It's a
matter o' twenty pound a year they tell me. I wish the twins had
lived, bless 'em," said she, dropping a few tears. "They should ha'
had the best o' schooling, and their belly-fulls o' food. I suppose
they're better off in heaven, only I should so like to see 'em."

Mary's heart filled with love at this new proof of Jem's goodness;
but she could not talk about it. She took Jane Wilson's hand, and
pressed it with affection; and then turned the subject to Will, her
sailor nephew. Jane was a little bit sorry, but her prosperity had
made her gentler, and she did not resent what she felt as Mary's
indifference to Jem and his merits.

"He's been in Africa and that neighbourhood, I believe. He's a fine
chap, but he's not gotten Jem's hair. His has too much o' the red
in it. He sent Alice (but, maybe, she telled you) a matter o' five
pound when he were over before; but that were nought to an income, yo
know."

"It's not every one that can get a hundred or two at a time," said
Mary.

"No! no! that's true enough. There's not many a one like Jem.
That's Alice's step," said she, hastening to open the door to her
sister-in-law. Alice looked weary, and sad, and dusty. The weariness
and the dust would not have been noticed either by her, or the
others, if it had not been for the sadness.

"No letters!" said Mrs. Wilson.

"No, none! I must just wait another day to hear fra my lad. It's very
dree work, waiting!" said Alice.

Margaret's words came into Mary's mind. Every one has their time and
kind of waiting.

"If I but knew he were safe, and not drowned!" spoke Alice. "If I but
knew he _were_ drowned, I would ask grace to say, Thy will be done.
It's the waiting."

"It's hard work to be patient to all of us," said Mary; "I know I
find it so, but I did not know one so good as you did, Alice; I shall
not think so badly of myself for being a bit impatient, now I've
heard you say you find it difficult."

The idea of reproach to Alice was the last in Mary's mind; and Alice
knew it was. Nevertheless, she said,

"Then, my dear, I ask your pardon, and God's pardon, too, if I've
weakened your faith, by showing you how feeble mine was. Half our
life's spent in waiting, and it ill becomes one like me, wi' so many
mercies, to grumble. I'll try and put a bridle o'er my tongue, and
my thoughts too." She spoke in a humble and gentle voice, like one
asking forgiveness.

"Come, Alice," interposed Mrs. Wilson, "don't fret yoursel for e'er a
trifle wrong said here or there. See! I've put th' kettle on, and you
and Mary shall ha' a dish o' tea in no time."

So she bustled about, and brought out a comfortable-looking
substantial loaf, and set Mary to cut bread and butter, while she
rattled out the tea-cups--always a cheerful sound.

Just as they were sitting down, there was a knock heard at the door,
and without waiting for it to be opened from the inside, some one
lifted the latch, and in a man's voice asked, if one George Wilson
lived there?

Mrs. Wilson was entering on a long and sorrowful explanation of
his having once lived there, but of his having dropped down dead;
when Alice, with the instinct of love (for in all usual and common
instances, sight and hearing failed to convey impressions to her
until long after other people had received them), arose, and tottered
to the door.

"My bairn!--my own dear bairn!" she exclaimed, falling on Will
Wilson's neck.

You may fancy the hospitable and welcoming commotion that ensued; how
Mrs. Wilson laughed, and talked, and cried, altogether, if such a
thing can be done; and how Mary gazed with wondering pleasure at
her old playmate; now a dashing, bronzed-looking, ringletted sailor,
frank, and hearty, and affectionate.

But it was something different from common to see Alice's joy at once
more having her foster-child with her. She did not speak, for she
really could not; but the tears came coursing down her old withered
cheeks, and dimmed the horn spectacles she had put on, in order to
pry lovingly into his face. So what with her failing sight, and her
tear-blinded eyes, she gave up the attempt of learning his face by
heart through the medium of that sense, and tried another. She passed
her sodden, shrivelled hands, all trembling with eagerness, over his
manly face, bent meekly down in order that she might more easily make
her strange inspection. At last, her soul was satisfied.

After tea, Mary, feeling sure there was much to be said on both
sides, at which it would be better no one should be present, not even
an intimate friend like herself, got up to go away. This seemed to
arouse Alice from her dreamy consciousness of exceeding happiness,
and she hastily followed Mary to the door. There, standing outside,
with the latch in her hand, she took hold of Mary's arm, and spoke
nearly the first words she had uttered since her nephew's return.

"My dear! I shall never forgive mysel, if my wicked words to-night
are any stumbling-block in your path. See how the Lord has put coals
of fire on my head! Oh! Mary, don't let my being an unbelieving
Thomas weaken your faith. Wait patiently on the Lord, whatever your
trouble may be."




CHAPTER XIII.

A TRAVELLER'S TALES.


   "The mermaid sat upon the rocks
         All day long,
   Admiring her beauty and combing her locks,
         And singing a mermaid song.

   "And hear the mermaid's song you may,
         As sure as sure can be,
   If you will but follow the sun all day,
         And souse with him into the sea."

   W. S. LANDOR.


It was perhaps four or five days after the events mentioned in the
last chapter, that one evening, as Mary stood lost in reverie at the
window, she saw Will Wilson enter the court, and come quickly up to
her door. She was glad to see him, for he had always been a friend of
hers, perhaps too much like her in character ever to become any thing
nearer or dearer. She opened the door in readiness to receive his
frank greeting, which she as frankly returned.

"Come, Mary! on with bonnet and shawl, or whatever rigging you women
require before leaving the house. I'm sent to fetch you, and I can't
lose time when I'm under orders."

"Where am I to go to?" asked Mary, as her heart leaped up at the
thought of who might be waiting for her.

"Not very far," replied he. "Only to old Job Legh's round the corner
here. Aunt would have me come and see these new friends of hers, and
then we meant to ha' come on here to see you and your father, but the
old gentleman seems inclined to make a night of it, and have you all
there. Where's your father? I want to see him. He must come too."

"He's out, but I'll leave word next door for him to follow me; that's
to say, if he comes home afore long." She added, hesitatingly, "Is
any one else at Job's?"

"No! My aunt Jane would not come for some maggot or other; and as
for Jem! I don't know what you've all been doing to him, but he's as
down-hearted a chap as I'd wish to see. He's had his sorrows sure
enough, poor lad! But it's time for him to be shaking off his dull
looks, and not go moping like a girl."

"Then he's come fra Halifax, is he?" asked Mary.

"Yes! his body's come, but I think he's left his heart behind him.
His tongue I'm sure he has, as we used to say to childer, when they
would not speak. I try to rouse him up a bit, and I think he likes
having me with him, but still he's as gloomy and as dull as can be.
'Twas only yesterday he took me to the works, and you'd ha' thought
us two Quakers as the spirit hadn't moved, all the way down we were
so mum. It's a place to craze a man, certainly; such a noisy black
hole! There were one or two things worth looking at, the bellows for
instance, or the gale they called a bellows. I could ha' stood near
it a whole day; and if I'd a berth in that place, I should like to be
bellows-man, if there is such a one. But Jem weren't diverted even
with that; he stood as grave as a judge while it blew my hat out o'
my hand. He's lost all relish for his food, too, which frets my aunt
sadly. Come! Mary, ar'n't you ready?"

She had not been able to gather if she were to see Jem at Job Legh's;
but when the door was opened, she at once saw and felt he was not
there. The evening then would be a blank; at least so she thought for
the first five minutes; but she soon forgot her disappointment in the
cheerful meeting of old friends, all, except herself, with some cause
for rejoicing at that very time. Margaret, who could not be idle, was
knitting away, with her face looking full into the room, away from
her work. Alice sat meek and patient with her dimmed eyes and gentle
look, trying to see and to hear, but never complaining; indeed, in
her inner self she was blessing God for her happiness; for the joy of
having her nephew, her child, near her, was far more present to her
mind, than her deprivations of sight and hearing.

Job was in the full glory of host and hostess too, for by a tacit
agreement he had roused himself from his habitual abstraction, and
had assumed many of Margaret's little household duties. While he
moved about he was deep in conversation with the young sailor, trying
to extract from him any circumstances connected with the natural
history of the different countries he had visited.

"Oh! if you are fond of grubs, and flies, and beetles, there's no
place for 'em like Sierra Leone. I wish you'd had some of ours; we
had rather too much of a good thing; we drank them with our drink,
and could scarcely keep from eating them with our food. I never
thought any folk could care for such fat green beasts as those, or I
would ha' brought you them by the thousand. A plate full o' peas-soup
would ha' been full enough for you, I dare say; it were often too
full for us."

"I would ha' given a good deal for some on 'em," said Job.

"Well, I knew folk at home liked some o' the queer things one meets
with abroad; but I never thought they'd care for them nasty slimy
things. I were always on the look-out for a mermaid, for that I knew
were a curiosity."

"You might ha' looked long enough," said Job, in an under-tone of
contempt, which, however, the quick ears of the sailor caught.

"Not so long, master, in some latitudes, as you think. It stands to
reason th' sea hereabouts is too cold for mermaids; for women here
don't go half-naked on account o' climate. But I've been in lands
where muslin were too hot to wear on land, and where the sea were
more than milk-warm; and though I'd never the good luck to see a
mermaid in that latitude, I know them that has."

"Do tell us about it," cried Mary.

"Pooh, pooh!" said Job the naturalist.

Both speeches determined Will to go on with his story. What could a
fellow who had never been many miles from home know about the wonders
of the deep, that he should put him down in that way?

"Well, it were Jack Harris, our third mate last voyage, as many
and many a time telled us all about it. You see he were becalmed
off Chatham Island (that's in the Great Pacific, and a warm enough
latitude for mermaids, and sharks, and such like perils). So some of
the men took the long boat, and pulled for the island to see what
it were like; and when they got near, they heard a puffing, like a
creature come up to take breath; you've never heard a diver? No!
Well! you've heard folks in th' asthma, and it were for all the world
like that. So they looked around, and what should they see but a
mermaid, sitting on a rock, and sunning herself. The water is always
warmer when it's rough, you know, so I suppose in the calm she felt
it rather chilly, and had come up to warm herself."

"What was she like?" asked Mary, breathlessly.

Job took his pipe off the chimney-piece and began to smoke with very
audible puffs, as if the story were not worth listening to.

"Oh! Jack used to say she was for all the world as beautiful as any
of the wax ladies in the barbers' shops; only, Mary, there were one
little difference: her hair was bright grass green."

"I should not think that was pretty," said Mary, hesitatingly; as if
not liking to doubt the perfection of any thing belonging to such an
acknowledged beauty.

"Oh! but it is when you're used to it. I always think when first
we get sight of land, there's no colour so lovely as grass green.
However, she had green hair sure enough; and were proud enough of it,
too; for she were combing it out full-length when first they saw her.
They all thought she were a fair prize, and may be as good as a whale
in ready money (they were whale-fishers you know). For some folk
think a deal of mermaids, whatever other folk do." This was a hit at
Job, who retaliated in a series of sonorous spittings and puffs.

"So, as I were saying, they pulled towards her, thinking to catch
her. She were all the while combing her beautiful hair, and beckoning
to them, while with the other hand she held a looking-glass."

"How many hands had she?" asked Job.

"Two, to be sure, just like any other woman," answered Will,
indignantly.

"Oh! I thought you said she beckoned with one hand, and combed her
hair with another, and held a looking-glass with a third," said Job,
with provoking quietness.

"No! I didn't! at least if I did, I meant she did one thing after
another, as any one but" (here he mumbled a word or two) "could
understand. Well, Mary," turning very decidedly towards her, "when
she saw them coming near, whether it were she grew frightened at
their fowling-pieces, as they had on board, for a bit o' shooting on
the island, or whether it were she were just a fickle jade as did not
rightly know her own mind (which, seeing one half of her was woman,
I think myself was most probable), but when they were only about two
oars' length from the rock where she sat, down she plopped into the
water, leaving nothing but her hinder end of a fish tail sticking up
for a minute, and then that disappeared too."

"And did they never see her again?" asked Mary.

"Never so plain; the man who had the second watch one night declared
he saw her swimming round the ship, and holding up her glass for him
to look in; and then he saw the little cottage near Aber in Wales
(where his wife lived) as plain as ever he saw it in life, and his
wife standing outside, shading her eyes as if she were looking for
him. But Jack Harris gave him no credit, for he said he were always a
bit of a romancer, and beside that, were a home-sick, down-hearted
chap."

"I wish they had caught her," said Mary, musing.

"They got one thing as belonged to her," replied Will, "and that I've
often seen with my own eyes, and I reckon it's a sure proof of the
truth of their story; for them that wants proof."

"What was it?" asked Margaret, almost anxious her grandfather should
be convinced.

"Why, in her hurry she left her comb on the rock, and one o' the men
spied it; so they thought that were better than nothing, and they
rowed there and took it, and Jack Harris had it on board the _John
Cropper_, and I saw him comb his hair with it every Sunday morning."

"What was it like?" asked Mary, eagerly; her imagination running on
coral combs, studded with pearls.

"Why, if it had not had such a strange yarn belonging to it, you'd
never ha' noticed it from any other small-tooth comb."

"I should rather think not," sneered Job Legh.

The sailor bit his lips to keep down his anger against an old man.
Margaret felt very uneasy, knowing her grandfather so well, and not
daring to guess what caustic remark might come next to irritate the
young sailor guest.

Mary, however, was too much interested by the wonders of the deep
to perceive the incredulity with which Job Legh received Wilson's
account of the mermaid; and when he left off, half offended, and very
much inclined not to open his lips again through the evening, she
eagerly said,

"Oh do tell us something more of what you hear and see on board ship.
Do, Will!"

"What's the use, Mary, if folk won't believe one. There are things
I saw with my own eyes, that some people would pish and pshaw at, as
if I were a baby to be put down by cross noises. But I'll tell you,
Mary," with an emphasis on _you_, "some more of the wonders of the
sea, sin' you're not too wise to believe me. I have seen a fish fly."

This did stagger Mary. She had heard of mermaids as signs of inns,
and as sea-wonders, but never of flying fish. Not so Job. He put down
his pipe, and nodding his head as a token of approbation, he said

"Ay, ay! young man. Now you're speaking truth."

"Well now! you'll swallow that, old gentleman. You'll credit me when
I say I've seen a crittur half fish, half bird, and you won't credit
me when I say there be such beasts as mermaids, half fish, half
woman. To me, one's just as strange as t'other."

"You never saw the mermaid yoursel," interposed Margaret, gently. But
"love me, love my dog," was Will Wilson's motto, only his version was
"believe me, believe Jack Harris;" and the remark was not so soothing
to him as it was intended to have been.

"It's the Exocetus; one of the Malacopterygii Abdominales," said Job,
much interested.

"Ay, there you go! You're one o' them folks as never knows beasts
unless they're called out o' their names. Put 'em in Sunday clothes
and you know 'em, but in their work-a-day English you never know
nought about 'em. I've met wi' many o' your kidney; and if I'd ha'
known it, I'd ha' christened poor Jack's mermaid wi' some grand
gibberish of a name. Mermaidicus Jack Harrisensis; that's just like
their new-fangled words. D'ye believe there's such a thing as the
Mermaidicus, master?" asked Will, enjoying his own joke uncommonly,
as most people do.

"Not I! Tell me about the--"

"Well!" said Will, pleased at having excited the old gentleman's
faith and credit at last. "It were on this last voyage, about a day's
sail from Madeira, that one of our men--"

"Not Jack Harris, I hope," murmured Job.

"Called me," continued Will, not noticing the interruption, "to see
the what d'ye call it--flying fish I say it is. It were twenty feet
out o' water, and it flew near on to a hundred yards. But I say, old
gentleman, I ha' gotten one dried, and if you'll take it, why, I'll
give it you; only," he added, in a lower tone, "I wish you'd just gie
me credit for the Mermaidicus."

I really believe if the assuming faith in the story of the mermaid
had been made the condition of receiving the flying fish, Job Legh,
sincere man as he was, would have pretended belief; he was so much
delighted at the idea of possessing this specimen. He won the
sailor's heart by getting up to shake both his hands in his vehement
gratitude, puzzling poor old Alice, who yet smiled through her
wonder; for she understood the action to indicate some kindly feeling
towards her nephew.

Job wanted to prove his gratitude, and was puzzled how to do it.
He feared the young man would not appreciate any of his duplicate
Araneides; not even the great American Mygale, one of his most
precious treasures; or else he would gladly have bestowed any
duplicate on the donor of a real dried Exocetus. What could he do
for him? He could ask Margaret to sing. Other folks beside her old
doating grandfather thought a deal of her songs. So Margaret began
some of her noble old-fashioned songs. She knew no modern music (for
which her auditors might have been thankful), but she poured her rich
voice out in some of the old canzonets she had lately learnt while
accompanying the musical lecturer on his tour.

Mary was amused to see how the young sailor sat entranced; mouth,
eyes, all open, in order to catch every breath of sound. His very
lids refused to wink, as if afraid in that brief proverbial interval
to lose a particle of the rich music that floated through the room.
For the first time the idea crossed Mary's mind that it was possible
the plain little sensible Margaret, so prim and demure, might have
power over the heart of the handsome, dashing, spirited Will Wilson.

Job, too, was rapidly changing his opinion of his new guest. The
flying fish went a great way, and his undisguised admiration for
Margaret's singing carried him still further.

It was amusing enough to see these two, within the hour so barely
civil to each other, endeavouring now to be ultra-agreeable. Will,
as soon as he had taken breath (a long, deep gasp of admiration)
after Margaret's song, sidled up to Job, and asked him in a sort of
doubting tone,

"You wouldn't like a live Manx cat, would ye, master?"

"A what?" exclaimed Job.

"I don't know its best name," said Will, humbly. "But we call 'em
just Manx cats. They're cats without tails."

Now Job, in all his natural history, had never heard of such animals;
so Will continued,

"Because I'm going, afore joining my ship, to see mother's friends in
the island, and would gladly bring you one, if so be you'd like to
have it. They look as queer and out o' nature as flying fish, or"--he
gulped the words down that should have followed. "Especially when
you see 'em walking a roof-top, right again the sky, when a cat, as
is a proper cat, is sure to stick her tail stiff out behind, like a
slack-rope dancer a-balancing; but these cats having no tail, cannot
stick it out, which captivates some people uncommonly. If yo'll allow
me, I'll bring one for Miss there," jerking his head at Margaret. Job
assented with grateful curiosity, wishing much to see the tail-less
phenomenon.

"When are you going to sail?" asked Mary.

"I cannot justly say; our ship's bound for America next voyage, they
tell me. A mess-mate will let me know when her sailing-day is fixed;
but I've got to go to th' Isle o' Man first. I promised uncle last
time I were in England to go this next time. I may have to hoist the
blue Peter any day; so, make much of me while you have me, Mary."

Job asked him if he had ever been in America.

"Haven't I? North and South both! This time we're bound to North.
Yankee-Land, as we call it, where Uncle Sam lives."

"Uncle who?" said Mary.

"Oh, it's a way sailors have of speaking. I only mean I'm going to
Boston, U. S., that's Uncle Sam."

Mary did not understand, so she left him and went to sit by Alice,
who could not hear conversation unless expressly addressed to her.
She had sat patiently silent the greater part of the night, and now
greeted Mary with a quiet smile.

"Where's yo'r father?" asked she.

"I guess he's at his Union; he's there most evenings."

Alice shook her head; but whether it were that she did not hear, or
that she did not quite approve of what she heard, Mary could not
make out. She sat silently watching Alice, and regretting over her
dimmed and veiled eyes, formerly so bright and speaking; as if Alice
understood by some other sense what was passing in Mary's mind, she
turned suddenly round, and answered Mary's thought.

"Yo're mourning for me, my dear; and there's no need, Mary. I'm as
happy as a child. I sometimes think I am a child, whom the Lord is
hushabying to my long sleep. For when I were a nurse-girl, my missis
alway telled me to speak very soft and low, and to darken the room
that her little one might go to sleep; and now all noises are hushed
and still to me, and the bonny earth seems dim and dark, and I
know it's my Father lulling me away to my long sleep. I'm very
well content, and yo mustn't fret for me. I've had well nigh every
blessing in life I could desire."

Mary thought of Alice's long-cherished, fond wish to revisit the home
of her childhood, so often and often deferred, and now probably never
to take place. Or if it did, how changed from the fond anticipation
of what it was to have been! It would be a mockery to the blind and
deaf Alice.

The evening came quickly to an end. There was the humble cheerful
meal, and then the bustling merry farewell, and Mary was once more in
the quietness and solitude of her own dingy, dreary-looking home; her
father still out, the fire extinguished, and her evening's task of
work lying all undone upon the dresser. But it had been a pleasant
little interlude to think upon. It had distracted her attention for
a few hours from the pressure of many uneasy thoughts, of the dark,
heavy, oppressive times, when sorrow and want seemed to surround her
on every side; of her father, his changed and altered looks, telling
so plainly of broken health, and an embittered heart; of the morrow,
and the morrow beyond that, to be spent in that close monotonous
work-room, with Sally Leadbitter's odious whispers hissing in her
ear; and of the hunted look, so full of dread, from Miss Simmonds'
door-step up and down the street, lest her persecuting lover should
be near: for he lay in wait for her with wonderful perseverance, and
of late had made himself almost hateful, by the unmanly force which
he had used to detain her to listen to him, and the indifference with
which he exposed her to the remarks of the passers-by, any one of
whom might circulate reports which it would be terrible for her
father to hear--and worse than death should they reach Jem Wilson.
And all this she had drawn upon herself by her giddy flirting. Oh!
how she loathed the recollection of the hot summer evening, when,
worn out by stitching and sewing, she had loitered homewards with
weary languor, and first listened to the voice of the tempter.

And Jem Wilson! Oh, Jem, Jem, why did you not come to receive some of
the modest looks and words of love which Mary longed to give you, to
try and make up for the hasty rejection which you as hastily took to
be final, though both mourned over it with many tears. But day after
day passed away, and patience seemed of no avail; and Mary's cry was
ever the old moan of the Moated Grange,

   "Why comes he not," she said,
   "I am aweary, aweary,
   I would that I were dead."




CHAPTER XIV.

JEM'S INTERVIEW WITH POOR ESTHER.


   "Know the temptation ere you judge the crime!
   Look on this tree--'twas green, and fair, and graceful;
   Yet now, save these few shoots, how dry and rotten!
   Thou canst not tell the cause. Not long ago,
   A neighbour oak, with which its roots were twined,
   In falling wrenched them with such cruel force,
   That though we covered them again with care,
   Its beauty withered, and it pined away.
   So, could we look into the human breast,
   How oft the fatal blight that meets our view,
   Should we trace down to the torn, bleeding fibres
   Of a too trusting heart--where it were shame,
   For pitying tears, to give contempt or blame."

   "STREET WALKS."


The month was over;--the honeymoon to the newly-married; the
exquisite convalescence to the "living mother of a living child;" the
"first dark days of nothingness" to the widow and the child bereaved;
the term of penance, of hard labour, and solitary confinement, to the
shrinking, shivering, hopeless prisoner.

"Sick, and in prison, and ye visited me." Shall you, or I, receive
such blessing? I know one who will. An overseer of a foundry, an aged
man, with hoary hair, has spent his Sabbaths, for many years, in
visiting the prisoners and the afflicted in Manchester New Bailey;
not merely advising and comforting, but putting means into their
power of regaining the virtue and the peace they had lost; becoming
himself their guarantee in obtaining employment, and never deserting
those who have once asked help from him. [43]


   [Footnote 43: Vide _Manchester Guardian_, of Wednesday, March 18,
                 1846; and also the Reports of Captain Williams,
                 prison inspector.]


Esther's term of imprisonment was ended. She received a good
character in the governor's books; she had picked her daily quantity
of oakum, had never deserved the extra punishment of the tread-mill,
and had been civil and decorous in her language. And once more she
was out of prison. The door closed behind her with a ponderous clang,
and in her desolation she felt as if shut out of home--from the only
shelter she could meet with, houseless and pennyless as she was, on
that dreary day.

But it was but for an instant that she stood there doubting. One
thought had haunted her both by night and by day, with monomaniacal
incessancy; and that thought was how to save Mary (her dead sister's
only child, her own little pet in the days of her innocence) from
following in the same downward path to vice. To whom could she speak
and ask for aid? She shrank from the idea of addressing John Barton
again; her heart sank within her, at the remembrance of his fierce
repulsing action, and far fiercer words. It seemed worse than death
to reveal her condition to Mary, else she sometimes thought that this
course would be the most terrible, the most efficient warning. She
must speak; to that she was soul-compelled; but to whom? She dreaded
addressing any of her former female acquaintance, even supposing they
had sense, or spirit, or interest enough to undertake her mission.

To whom shall the outcast prostitute tell her tale? Who will give her
help in her day of need? Hers is the leper-sin, and all stand aloof
dreading to be counted unclean.

In her wild night wanderings, she had noted the haunts and habits
of many a one who little thought of a watcher in the poor forsaken
woman. You may easily imagine that a double interest was attached
by her to the ways and companionships of those with whom she had
been acquainted in the days which, when present, she had considered
hardly-worked and monotonous, but which now in retrospection seemed
so happy and unclouded. Accordingly, she had, as we have seen, known
where to meet with John Barton on that unfortunate night, which had
only produced irritation in him, and a month's imprisonment to her.
She had also observed that he was still intimate with the Wilsons.
She had seen him walking and talking with both father and son; her
old friends too; and she had shed unregarded, unvalued tears, when
some one had casually told her of George Wilson's sudden death. It
now flashed across her mind, that to the son, to Mary's play-fellow,
her elder brother in the days of childhood, her tale might be told,
and listened to with interest, and some mode of action suggested by
him by which Mary might be guarded and saved.

All these thoughts had passed through her mind while yet she was in
prison; so when she was turned out, her purpose was clear, and she
did not feel her desolation of freedom as she would otherwise have
done.

That night she stationed herself early near the foundry where she
knew Jem worked; he stayed later than usual, being detained by some
arrangements for the morrow. She grew tired and impatient; many
workmen had come out of the door in the long, dead, brick wall, and
eagerly had she peered into their faces, deaf to all insult or curse.
He must have gone home early; one more turn in the street, and she
would go.

During that turn he came out, and in the quiet of that street of
workshops and warehouses, she directly heard his steps. Now her heart
failed her for an instant; but still she was not daunted from her
purpose, painful as its fulfilment was sure to be. She laid her hand
on his arm. As she expected, after a momentary glance at the person
who thus endeavoured to detain him, he made an effort to shake it
off, and pass on. But trembling as she was, she had provided against
this by a firm and unusual grasp.

"You must listen to me, Jem Wilson," she said, with almost an accent
of command.

"Go away, missis; I've nought to do with you, either in hearkening,
or talking."

He made another struggle.

"You must listen," she said again, authoritatively, "for Mary
Barton's sake."

The spell of her name was as potent as that of the mariner's
glittering eye. "He listened like a three-year child."

"I know you care enough for her to wish to save her from harm."

He interrupted his earnest gaze into her face, with the exclamation--

"And who can yo be to know Mary Barton, or to know that she's ought
to me?"

There was a little strife in Esther's mind for an instant, between
the shame of acknowledging herself, and the additional weight to her
revelation which such acknowledgment would give. Then she spoke.

"Do you remember Esther, the sister of John Barton's wife? the aunt
to Mary? And the Valentine I sent you last February ten years?"

"Yes, I mind her well! But yo are not Esther, are you?" He looked
again into her face, and seeing that indeed it was his boyhood's
friend, he took her hand, and shook it with a cordiality that forgot
the present in the past.

"Why, Esther! Where han ye been this many a year? Where han ye been
wandering that we none of us could find you out?"

The question was asked thoughtlessly, but answered with fierce
earnestness.

"Where have I been? What have I been doing? Why do you torment me
with questions like these? Can you not guess? But the story of my
life is wanted to give force to my speech, afterwards I will tell it
you. Nay! don't change your fickle mind now, and say you don't want
to hear it. You must hear it, and I must tell it; and then see after
Mary, and take care she does not become like me. As she is loving
now, so did I love once; one above me far." She remarked not, in her
own absorption, the change in Jem's breathing, the sudden clutch at
the wall which told the fearfully vivid interest he took in what she
said. "He was so handsome, so kind! Well, the regiment was ordered to
Chester (did I tell you he was an officer?), and he could not bear to
part from me, nor I from him, so he took me with him. I never thought
poor Mary would have taken it so to heart! I always meant to send for
her to pay me a visit when I was married; for, mark you! he promised
me marriage. They all do. Then came three years of happiness. I
suppose I ought not to have been happy, but I was. I had a little
girl, too. Oh! the sweetest darling that ever was seen! But I must
not think of her," putting her hand wildly up to her forehead, "or I
shall go mad; I shall."

"Don't tell me any more about yoursel," said Jem, soothingly.

"What! you're tired already, are you? but I'll tell you; as you've
asked for it, you shall hear it. I won't recall the agony of the past
for nothing. I will have the relief of telling it. Oh, how happy I
was!"--sinking her voice into a plaintive child-like manner. "It
came like a shot on me when one day he came to me and told me he was
ordered to Ireland, and must leave me behind; at Bristol we then
were."

Jem muttered some words; she caught their meaning, and in a pleading
voice continued,

"Oh, don't abuse him; don't speak a word against him! You don't know
how I love him yet; yet, when I am sunk so low. You don't guess how
kind he was. He gave me fifty pound before we parted, and I knew he
could ill spare it. Don't, Jem, please," as his muttered indignation
rose again. For her sake he ceased. "I might have done better with
the money; I see now. But I did not know the value of money. Formerly
I had earned it easily enough at the factory, and as I had no more
sensible wants, I spent it on dress and on eating. While I lived with
him, I had it for asking; and fifty pounds would, I thought, go a
long way. So I went back to Chester, where I'd been so happy, and
set up a small-ware shop, and hired a room near. We should have done
well, but alas! alas! my little girl fell ill, and I could not mind
my shop and her too; and things grew worse and worse. I sold my
goods any how to get money to buy her food and medicine; I wrote
over and over again to her father for help, but he must have changed
his quarters, for I never got an answer. The landlord seized the
few bobbins and tapes I had left, for shop-rent; and the person to
whom the mean little room, to which we had been forced to remove,
belonged, threatened to turn us out unless his rent was paid; it had
run on many weeks, and it was winter, cold bleak winter; and my child
was so ill, so ill, and I was starving. And I could not bear to see
her suffer, and forgot how much better it would be for us to die
together;--oh her moans, her moans, which money would give me the
means of relieving! So I went out into the street, one January
night--Do you think God will punish me for that?" she asked with wild
vehemence, almost amounting to insanity, and shaking Jem's arm in
order to force an answer from him.

But before he could shape his heart's sympathy into words, her voice
had lost its wildness, and she spoke with the quiet of despair.

"But it's no matter! I've done that since, which separates us as far
asunder as heaven and hell can be." Her voice rose again to the sharp
pitch of agony. "My darling! my darling! even after death I may not
see thee, my own sweet one! She was so good--like a little angel.
What is that text, I don't remember,--that text mother used to teach
me when I sat on her knee long ago; it begins, 'Blessed are the
pure'"--

"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."

"Ay, that's it! It would break mother's heart if she knew what I am
now--it did break Mary's heart, you see. And now I recollect it was
about her child I wanted so to see you, Jem. You know Mary Barton,
don't you?" said she, trying to collect her thoughts.

Yes, Jem knew her. How well, his beating heart could testify!

"Well, there's something to do for her; I forget what; wait a
minute! She is so like my little girl;" said she, raising her eyes,
glistening with unshed tears, in search of the sympathy of Jem's
countenance.

He deeply pitied her; but oh! how he longed to recall her mind to the
subject of Mary, and the lover above her in rank, and the service to
be done for her sake. But he controlled himself to silence. After
awhile, she spoke again, and in a calmer voice.

"When I came to Manchester (for I could not stay in Chester after her
death), I found you all out very soon. And yet I never thought my
poor sister was dead. I suppose I would not think so. I used to watch
about the court where John lived, for many and many a night, and
gather all I could about them from the neighbours' talk; for I never
asked a question. I put this and that together, and followed one, and
listened to the other; many's the time I've watched the policeman off
his beat, and peeped through the chink of the window-shutter to see
the old room, and sometimes Mary or her father sitting up late for
some reason or another. I found out Mary went to learn dress-making,
and I began to be frightened for her; for it's a bad life for a girl
to be out late at night in the streets, and after many an hour of
weary work, they're ready to follow after any novelty that makes a
little change. But I made up my mind, that bad as I was, I could
watch over Mary and perhaps keep her from harm. So I used to wait
for her at nights, and follow her home, often when she little knew
any one was near her. There was one of her companions I never could
abide, and I'm sure that girl is at the bottom of some mischief.
By-and-bye, Mary's walks homewards were not alone. She was joined
soon after she came out, by a man; a gentleman. I began to fear
for her, for I saw she was light-hearted, and pleased with his
attentions; and I thought worse of him for having such long talks
with that bold girl I told you of. But I was laid up for a long time
with spitting of blood; and could do nothing. I'm sure it made me
worse, thinking about what might be happening to Mary. And when I
came out, all was going on as before, only she seemed fonder of him
than ever; and oh Jem! her father won't listen to me, and it's you
must save Mary! You're like a brother to her, and maybe could give
her advice and watch over her, and at any rate John will hearken to
you; only he's so stern and so cruel." She began to cry a little at
the remembrance of his harsh words; but Jem cut her short by his
hoarse, stern inquiry,

"Who is this spark that Mary loves? Tell me his name!"

"It's young Carson, old Carson's son, that your father worked for."

There was a pause. She broke the silence.

"Oh! Jem, I charge you with the care of her! I suppose it would be
murder to kill her, but it would be better for her to die than to
live to lead such a life as I do. Do you hear me, Jem?"

"Yes! I hear you. It would be better. Better we were all dead." This
was said as if thinking aloud; but he immediately changed his tone,
and continued,

"Esther, you may trust to my doing all I can for Mary. That I have
determined on. And now listen to me! you loathe the life you lead,
else you would not speak of it as you do. Come home with me. Come to
my mother. She and my aunt Alice live together. I will see that they
give you a welcome. And to-morrow I will see if some honest way of
living cannot be found for you. Come home with me."

She was silent for a minute, and he hoped he had gained his point.
Then she said,

"God bless you, Jem, for the words you have just spoken. Some years
ago you might have saved me, as I hope and trust you will yet save
Mary. But it is too late now;--too late," she added, with accents of
deep despair.

Still he did not relax his hold. "Come home," he said.

"I tell you, I cannot. I could not lead a virtuous life if I would.
I should only disgrace you. If you will know all," said she, as he
still seemed inclined to urge her, "I must have drink. Such as live
like me could not bear life if they did not drink. It's the only
thing to keep us from suicide. If we did not drink, we could not
stand the memory of what we have been, and the thought of what we
are, for a day. If I go without food, and without shelter, I must
have my dram. Oh! you don't know the awful nights I have had in
prison for want of it!" said she, shuddering, and glaring round with
terrified eyes, as if dreading to see some spiritual creature, with
dim form, near her.

"It is so frightful to see them," whispering in tones of wildness,
although so low spoken. "There they go round and round my bed the
whole night through. My mother, carrying little Annie (I wonder how
they got together) and Mary--and all looking at me with their sad,
stony eyes; oh Jem! it is so terrible! They don't turn back either,
but pass behind the head of the bed, and I feel their eyes on me
everywhere. If I creep under the clothes I still see them; and what
is worse," hissing out her words with fright, "they see me. Don't
speak to me of leading a better life--I must have drink. I cannot
pass to-night without a dram; I dare not."

Jem was silent from deep sympathy. Oh! could he, then, do nothing for
her! She spoke again, but in a less excited tone, although it was
thrillingly earnest.

"You are grieved for me! I know it better than if you told me in
words. But you can do nothing for me. I am past hope. You can yet
save Mary. You must. She is innocent, except for the great error of
loving one above her in station. Jem! you _will_ save her?"

With heart and soul, though in few words, Jem promised that if aught
earthly could keep her from falling, he would do it. Then she blessed
him, and bade him good-night.

"Stay a minute," said he, as she was on the point of departure. "I
may want to speak to you again. I mun know where to find you--where
do you live?"

She laughed strangely. "And do you think one sunk so low as I am has
a home? Decent, good people have homes. We have none. No, if you want
me, come at night, and look at the corners of the streets about here.
The colder, the bleaker, the more stormy the night, the more certain
you will be to find me. For then," she added, with a plaintive fall
in her voice, "it is so cold sleeping in entries, and on door-steps,
and I want a dram more than ever."

Again she rapidly turned off, and Jem also went on his way. But
before he reached the end of the street, even in the midst of the
jealous anguish that filled his heart, his conscience smote him.
He had not done enough to save her. One more effort, and she might
have come. Nay, twenty efforts would have been well rewarded by her
yielding. He turned back, but she was gone. In the tumult of his
other feelings, his self-reproach was deadened for the time. But many
and many a day afterwards he bitterly regretted his omission of duty;
his weariness of well-doing.

Now, the great thing was to reach home, and solitude. Mary loved
another! Oh! how should he bear it? He had thought her rejection of
him a hard trial, but that was nothing now. He only remembered it,
to be thankful he had not yielded to the temptation of trying his
fate again, not in actual words, but in a meeting, where her manner
should tell far more than words, that her sweeter smiles, her dainty
movements, her pretty household ways, were all to be reserved to
gladden another's eyes and heart. And he must live on; that seemed
the strangest. That a long life (and he knew men did live long, even
with deep, biting sorrow corroding at their hearts) must be spent
without Mary; nay, with the consciousness she was another's! That
hell of thought he would reserve for the quiet of his own room, the
dead stillness of night. He was on the threshold of home now.

He entered. There were the usual faces, the usual sights. He loathed
them, and then he cursed himself because he loathed them. His
mother's love had taken a cross turn, because he had kept the
tempting supper she had prepared for him waiting until it was
nearly spoilt. Alice, her dulled senses deadening day by day, sat
mutely near the fire; her happiness, bounded by the circle of the
consciousness of the presence of her foster child, knowing that his
voice repeated what was passing to her deafened ear, that his arm
removed each little obstacle to her tottering steps. And Will, out
of the very kindness of his heart, talked more and more merrily than
ever. He saw Jem was downcast, and fancied his rattling might cheer
him; at any rate, it drowned his aunt's muttered grumblings, and in
some measure concealed the blank of the evening. At last, bed-time
came; and Will withdrew to his neighbouring lodging; and Jane and
Alice Wilson had raked the fire, and fastened doors and shutters,
and pattered up stairs, with their tottering foot-steps, and shrill
voices. Jem, too, went to the closet termed his bed-room. There was
no bolt to the door; but by one strong effort of his right arm, a
heavy chest was moved against it, and he could sit down on the side
of his bed, and think.

Mary loved another! That idea would rise uppermost in his mind, and
had to be combated in all its forms of pain. It was, perhaps, no
great wonder that she should prefer one so much above Jem in the
external things of life. But the gentleman; why did he, with his
range of choice among the ladies of the land, why did he stoop down
to carry off the poor man's darling? With all the glories of the
garden at his hand, why did he prefer to cull the wild-rose,--Jem's
own fragrant wild-rose?

His _own!_ Oh! never now his own!--Gone for evermore!

Then uprose the guilty longing for blood!--The frenzy of
jealousy!--Some one should die. He would rather Mary were dead, cold
in her grave, than that she were another's. A vision of her pale,
sweet face, with her bright hair all bedabbled with gore, seemed to
float constantly before his aching eyes. But hers were ever open,
and contained, in their soft, deathly look, such mute reproach! What
had she done to deserve such cruel treatment from him? She had been
wooed by one whom Jem knew to be handsome, gay, and bright, and she
had given him her love. That was all! It was the wooer who should
die. Yes, die, knowing the cause of his death. Jem pictured him (and
gloated on the picture), lying smitten, yet conscious; and listening
to the upbraiding accusation of his murderer. How he had left his own
rank, and dared to love a maiden of low degree; and--oh! stinging
agony of all--how she, in return, had loved him! Then the other
nature spoke up, and bade him remember the anguish he should so
prepare for Mary! At first he refused to listen to that better voice;
or listened only to pervert. He would glory in her wailing grief! he
would take pleasure in her desolation of heart!

No! he could not, said the still small voice. It would be worse, far
worse, to have caused such woe, than it was now to bear his present
heavy burden.

But it was too heavy, too grievous to be borne, and live. He would
slay himself, and the lovers should love on, and the sun shine
bright, and he with his burning, woeful heart would be at rest. "Rest
that is reserved for the people of God."

Had he not promised with such earnest purpose of soul, as makes words
more solemn than oaths, to save Mary from becoming such as Esther?
Should he shrink from the duties of life, into the cowardliness of
death? Who would then guard Mary, with her love and her innocence?
Would it not be a goodly thing to serve her, although she loved him
not; to be her preserving angel, through the perils of life; and she,
unconscious all the while?

He braced up his soul, and said to himself, that with God's help he
would be that earthly keeper.

And now the mists and the storms seemed clearing away from his path,
though it still was full of stinging thorns. Having done the duty
nearest to him (of reducing the tumult of his own heart to something
like order), the second became more plain before him.

Poor Esther's experience had led her, perhaps, too hastily to the
conclusion, that Mr. Carson's intentions were evil towards Mary; at
least she had given no just ground for the fears she entertained
that such was the case. It was possible, nay, to Jem's heart, very
probable, that he might only be too happy to marry her. She was a
lady by right of nature, Jem thought; in movement, grace, and spirit.
what was birth to a Manchester manufacturer, many of whom glory, and
justly too, in being the architects of their own fortunes? And, as
far as wealth was concerned, judging another by himself, Jem could
only imagine it a great privilege to lay it at the feet of the loved
one. Harry Carson's mother had been a factory girl; so, after all,
what was the great reason for doubting his intentions towards Mary?

There might probably be some little awkwardness about the affair at
first: Mary's father having such strong prejudices on the one hand;
and something of the same kind being likely to exist on the part of
Mr. Carson's family. But Jem knew he had power over John Barton's
mind; and it would be something to exert that power in promoting
Mary's happiness, and to relinquish all thought of self in so doing.

Oh! why had Esther chosen him for this office? It was beyond his
strength to act rightly! Why had she singled him out?

The answer came when he was calm enough to listen for it. Because
Mary had no other friend capable of the duty required of him; the
duty of a brother, as Esther imagined him to be in feeling, from his
long friendship. He would be unto her as a brother.

As such, he ought to ascertain Harry Carson's intentions towards
her in winning her affections. He would ask him, straightforwardly,
as became man speaking to man, not concealing, if need were, the
interest he felt in Mary.

Then, with the resolve to do his duty to the best of his power, peace
came into his soul; he had left the windy storm and tempest behind.

Two hours before day-dawn he fell asleep.




CHAPTER XV.

A VIOLENT MEETING BETWEEN THE RIVALS.


   "What thoughtful heart can look into this gulf
   That darkly yawns 'twixt rich and poor,
   And not find food for saddest meditation!
   Can see, without a pang of keenest grief,
   Them fiercely battling (like some natural foes)
   Whom God had made, with help and sympathy,
   To stand as brothers, side by side, united!
   Where is the wisdom that shall bridge this gulf,
   And bind them once again in trust and love?"

   "LOVE-TRUTHS."


We must return to John Barton. Poor John! He never got over his
disappointing journey to London. The deep mortification he then
experienced (with, perhaps, as little selfishness for its cause as
mortification ever had) was of no temporary nature; indeed, few of
his feelings were.

Then came a long period of bodily privation; of daily hunger after
food; and though he tried to persuade himself he could bear want
himself with stoical indifference, and did care about it as little
as most men, yet the body took its revenge for its uneasy feelings.
The mind became soured and morose, and lost much of its equipoise.
It was no longer elastic, as in the days of youth, or in times of
comparative happiness; it ceased to hope. And it is hard to live on
when one can no longer hope.

The same state of feeling which John Barton entertained, if belonging
to one who had had leisure to think of such things, and physicians to
give names to them, would have been called monomania; so haunting, so
incessant, were the thoughts that pressed upon him. I have somewhere
read a forcibly described punishment among the Italians, worthy of a
Borgia. The supposed or real criminal was shut up in a room, supplied
with every convenience and luxury; and at first mourned little
over his imprisonment. But day by day he became aware that the
space between the walls of his apartment was narrowing, and then
he understood the end. Those painted walls would come into hideous
nearness, and at last crush the life out of him.

And so day by day, nearer and nearer, came the diseased thoughts of
John Barton. They excluded the light of heaven, the cheering sounds
of earth. They were preparing his death.

It is true, much of their morbid power might be ascribed to the use
of opium. But before you blame too harshly this use, or rather abuse,
try a hopeless life, with daily cravings of the body for food. Try,
not alone being without hope yourself, but seeing all around you
reduced to the same despair, arising from the same circumstances; all
around you telling (though they use no words or language), by their
looks and feeble actions, that they are suffering and sinking under
the pressure of want. Would you not be glad to forget life, and its
burdens? And opium gives forgetfulness for a time.

It is true they who thus purchase it pay dearly for their oblivion;
but can you expect the uneducated to count the cost of their whistle?
Poor wretches! They pay a heavy price. Days of oppressive weariness
and languor, whose realities have the feeble sickliness of dreams;
nights, whose dreams are fierce realities of agony; sinking health,
tottering frames, incipient madness, and worse, the _consciousness_
of incipient madness; this is the price of their whistle. But have
you taught them the science of consequences?

John Barton's overpowering thought, which was to work out his fate on
earth, was rich and poor; why are they so separate, so distinct, when
God has made them all? It is not His will, that their interests are
so far apart. Whose doing is it?

And so on into the problems and mysteries of life, until, bewildered
and lost, unhappy and suffering, the only feeling that remained clear
and undisturbed in the tumult of his heart, was hatred to the one
class and keen sympathy with the other.

But what availed his sympathy? No education had given him wisdom;
and without wisdom, even love, with all its effects, too often
works but harm. He acted to the best of his judgment, but it was a
widely-erring judgment.

The actions of the uneducated seem to me typified in those of
Frankenstein, that monster of many human qualities, ungifted with a
soul, a knowledge of the difference between good and evil.

The people rise up to life; they irritate us, they terrify us, and we
become their enemies. Then, in the sorrowful moment of our triumphant
power, their eyes gaze on us with a mute reproach. Why have we made
them what they are; a powerful monster, yet without the inner means
for peace and happiness?

John Barton became a Chartist, a Communist, all that is commonly
called wild and visionary. Ay! but being visionary is something. It
shows a soul, a being not altogether sensual; a creature who looks
forward for others, if not for himself.

And with all his weakness he had a sort of practical power, which
made him useful to the bodies of men to whom he belonged. He had a
ready kind of rough Lancashire eloquence, arising out of the fulness
of his heart, which was very stirring to men similarly circumstanced,
who liked to hear their feelings put into words. He had a pretty
clear head at times, for method and arrangement; a necessary talent
to large combinations of men. And what perhaps more than all made him
relied upon and valued, was the consciousness which every one who
came in contact with him felt, that he was actuated by no selfish
motives; that his class, his order, was what he stood by, not the
rights of his own paltry self. For even in great and noble men, as
soon as self comes into prominent existence, it becomes a mean and
paltry thing.

A little time before this, there had come one of those occasions for
deliberation among the employed, which deeply interested John Barton;
and the discussions concerning which had caused his frequent absence
from home of late.

I am not sure if I can express myself in the technical terms of
either masters or workmen, but I will try simply to state the case on
which the latter deliberated.

An order for coarse goods came in from a new foreign market. It was
a large order, giving employment to all the mills engaged in that
species of manufacture: but it was necessary to execute it speedily,
and at as low prices as possible, as the masters had reason to
believe a duplicate order had been sent to one of the continental
manufacturing towns, where there were no restrictions on food, no
taxes on building or machinery, and where consequently they dreaded
that the goods could be made at a much lower price than they could
afford them for; and that, by so acting and charging, the rival
manufacturers would obtain undivided possession of the market. It was
clearly their interest to buy cotton as cheaply, and to beat down
wages as low as possible. And in the long run the interests of the
workmen would have been thereby benefited. Distrust each other as
they may, the employers and the employed must rise or fall together.
There may be some difference as to chronology, none as to fact.

But the masters did not choose to make all these facts known. They
stood upon being the masters, and that they had a right to order work
at their own prices, and they believed that in the present depression
of trade, and unemployment of hands, there would be no great
difficulty in getting it done.

Now let us turn to the workmen's view of the question. The masters
(of the tottering foundation of whose prosperity they were ignorant)
seemed doing well, and like gentlemen, "lived at home in ease," while
they were starving, gasping on from day to day; and there was a
foreign order to be executed, the extent of which, large as it was,
was greatly exaggerated; and it was to be done speedily. Why were the
masters offering such low wages under these circumstances? Shame
upon them! It was taking advantage of their work-people being almost
starved; but they would starve entirely rather than come into such
terms. It was bad enough to be poor, while by the labour of their
thin hands, the sweat of their brows, the masters were made rich; but
they would not be utterly ground down to dust. No! they would fold
their hands, and sit idle, and smile at the masters, whom even in
death they could baffle. With Spartan endurance they determined to
let the employers know their power, by refusing to work.

So class distrusted class, and their want of mutual confidence
wrought sorrow to both. The masters would not be bullied, and
compelled to reveal why they felt it wisest and best to offer only
such low wages; they would not be made to tell that they were even
sacrificing capital to obtain a decisive victory over the continental
manufacturers. And the workmen sat silent and stern with folded
hands, refusing to work for such pay. There was a strike in
Manchester.

Of course it was succeeded by the usual consequences. Many other
Trades' Unions, connected with different branches of business,
supported with money, countenance, and encouragement of every kind,
the stand which the Manchester power-loom weavers were making against
their masters. Delegates from Glasgow, from Nottingham, and other
towns, were sent to Manchester, to keep up the spirit of resistance;
a committee was formed, and all the requisite officers elected;
chairman, treasurer, honorary secretary:--among them was John Barton.

The masters, meanwhile, took their measures. They placarded the walls
with advertisements for power-loom weavers. The workmen replied by
a placard in still larger letters, stating their grievances. The
masters met daily in town, to mourn over the time (so fast slipping
away) for the fulfilment of the foreign orders; and to strengthen
each other in their resolution not to yield. If they gave up now,
they might give up always. It would never do. And amongst the
most energetic of the masters, the Carsons, father and son, took
their places. It is well known, that there is no religionist so
zealous as a convert; no masters so stern, and regardless of the
interests of their work-people, as those who have risen from such a
station themselves. This would account for the elder Mr. Carson's
determination not to be bullied into yielding; not even to be bullied
into giving reasons for acting as the masters did. It was the
employer's will, and that should be enough for the employed. Harry
Carson did not trouble himself much about the grounds for his
conduct. He liked the excitement of the affair. He liked the attitude
of resistance. He was brave, and he liked the idea of personal
danger, with which some of the more cautious tried to intimidate the
violent among the masters.

Meanwhile, the power-loom weavers living in the more remote parts
of Lancashire, and the neighbouring counties, heard of the masters'
advertisements for workmen; and in their solitary dwellings grew
weary of starvation, and resolved to come to Manchester. Foot-sore,
way-worn, half-starved looking men they were, as they tried to steal
into town in the early dawn, before people were astir, or late in the
dusk of evening. And now began the real wrong-doing of the Trades'
Unions. As to their decision to work, or not, at such a particular
rate of wages, that was either wise or unwise; all error of judgment
at the worst. But they had no right to tyrannise over others, and
tie them down to their own procrustean bed. Abhorring what they
considered oppression in the masters, why did they oppress others?
Because, when men get excited, they know not what they do. Judge,
then, with something of the mercy of the Holy One, whom we all love.

In spite of policemen set to watch over the safety of the poor
country weavers,--in spite of magistrates, and prisons, and severe
punishments,--the poor depressed men tramping in from Burnley,
Padiham, and other places, to work at the condemned "Starvation
Prices," were waylaid, and beaten, and left almost for dead by the
road-side. The police broke up every lounging knot of men:--they
separated quietly, to reunite half-a-mile further out of town.

Of course the feeling between the masters and workmen did not improve
under these circumstances.

Combination is an awful power. It is like the equally mighty agency
of steam; capable of almost unlimited good or evil. But to obtain
a blessing on its labours, it must work under the direction of a
high and intelligent will; incapable of being misled by passion, or
excitement. The will of the operatives had not been guided to the
calmness of wisdom.

So much for generalities. Let us now return to individuals.

A note, respectfully worded, although its tone of determination was
strong, had been sent from the power-loom weavers, requesting that a
"deputation" of them might have a meeting with the masters, to state
the conditions they must have fulfilled before they would end the
turn-out. They thought they had attained a sufficiently commanding
position to dictate. John Barton was appointed one of the deputation.

The masters agreed to this meeting, being anxious to end the strife,
although undetermined among themselves how far they should yield, or
whether they should yield at all. Some of the old, whose experience
had taught them sympathy, were for concession. Others, white-headed
men too, had only learnt hardness and obstinacy from the days of the
years of their lives, and sneered at the more gentle and yielding.
The younger men were one and all for an unflinching resistance to
claims urged with so much violence. Of this party Harry Carson was
the leader.

But like all energetic people, the more he had to do the more time
he seemed to find. With all his letter-writing, his calling, his
being present at the New Bailey, when investigations of any case
of violence against knob-sticks [44] were going on, he beset Mary
more than ever. She was weary of her life for him. From blandishments
he had even gone to threats--threats that whether she would or
not she should be his; he showed an indifference that was almost
insulting to every thing that might attract attention and injure her
character.


   [Footnote 44: "Knob-sticks," those who consent to work at
                 lower wages.]


And still she never saw Jem. She knew he had returned home. She heard
of him occasionally through his cousin, who roved gaily from house to
house, finding and making friends everywhere. But she never saw him.
What was she to think? Had he given her up? Were a few hasty words,
spoken in a moment of irritation, to stamp her lot through life? At
times she thought that she could bear this meekly, happy in her own
constant power of loving. For of change or of forgetfulness she did
not dream. Then at other times her state of impatience was such, that
it required all her self-restraint to prevent her from going and
seeking him out, and (as man would do to man, or woman to woman)
begging him to forgive her hasty words, and allow her to retract
them, and bidding him accept of the love that was filling her whole
heart. She wished Margaret had not advised her against such a manner
of proceeding; she believed it was her friend's words that seemed to
make such a simple action impossible, in spite of all the internal
urgings. But a friend's advice is only thus powerful, when it puts
into language the secret oracle of our souls. It was the whisperings
of her womanly nature that caused her to shrink from any unmaidenly
action, not Margaret's counsel.

All this time, this ten days or so, of Will's visit to Manchester,
there was something going on which interested Mary even now, and
which, in former times, would have exceedingly amused and excited
her. She saw as clearly as if told in words, that the merry, random,
boisterous sailor had fallen deeply in love with the quiet, prim,
somewhat plain Margaret: she doubted if Margaret was aware of it, and
yet, as she watched more closely, she began to think some instinct
made the blind girl feel whose eyes were so often fixed upon her
pale face; that some inner feeling made the delicate and becoming
rose-flush steal over her countenance. She did not speak so decidedly
as before; there was a hesitation in her manner, that seemed to make
her very attractive; as if something softer, more loveable than
excellent sense, were coming in as a motive for speech; her eyes had
always been soft, and were in no ways disfigured by her blindness,
and now seemed to have a new charm, as they quivered under their
white down-cast lids. She must be conscious, thought Mary,--heart
answering heart.

Will's love had no blushings, no downcast eyes, no weighing of words;
it was as open and undisguised as his nature; yet he seemed afraid
of the answer its acknowledgment might meet with. It was Margaret's
angelic voice that had entranced him, and which made him think of her
as a being of some other sphere, that he feared to woo. So he tried
to propitiate Job in all manner of ways. He went over to Liverpool to
rummage in his great sea-chest for the flying-fish (no very odorous
present by the way). He hesitated over a child's caul for some time,
which was, in his eyes, a far greater treasure than any Exocetus.
What use could it be of to a landsman? Then Margaret's voice rang
in his ears; and he determined to sacrifice it, his most precious
possession, to one whom she loved, as she did her grandfather.

It was rather a relief to him, when, having put it and the
flying-fish together in a brown paper parcel, and sat upon them
for security all the way in the railroad, he found that Job was so
indifferent to the precious caul, that he might easily claim it
again. He hung about Margaret, till he had received many warnings and
reproaches from his conscience in behalf of his dear aunt Alice's
claims upon his time. He went away, and then he bethought him of some
other little word with Job. And he turned back, and stood talking
once more in Margaret's presence, door in hand, only waiting for some
little speech of encouragement to come in and sit down again. But as
the invitation was not given, he was forced to leave at last, and go
and do his duty.

Four days had Jem Wilson watched for Mr. Harry Carson without
success; his hours of going and returning to his home were so
irregular, owing to the meetings and consultations among the masters,
which were rendered necessary by the turn-out. On the fifth, without
any purpose on Jem's part, they met.

It was the workmen's dinner-hour, the interval between twelve and
one; when the streets of Manchester are comparatively quiet, for
a few shopping ladies and lounging gentlemen count for nothing in
that busy, bustling, living place. Jem had been on an errand for his
master, instead of returning to his dinner; and in passing along a
lane, a road (called, in compliment to the intentions of some future
builder, a street), he encountered Harry Carson, the only person, as
far as he saw beside himself, treading the unfrequented path. Along
one side ran a high broad fence, blackened over by coal-tar, and
spiked and stuck with pointed nails at the top, to prevent any one
from climbing over into the garden beyond. By this fence was the
foot-path. The carriage road was such as no carriage, no, not even a
cart, could possibly have passed along, without Hercules to assist
in lifting it out of the deep clay ruts. On the other side of the
way was a dead brick wall; and a field after that, where there was a
sawpit, and joiner's shed.

Jem's heart beat violently when he saw the gay, handsome young man
approaching, with a light, buoyant step. This, then, was he whom Mary
loved. It was, perhaps, no wonder; for he seemed to the poor smith
so elegant, so well-appointed, that he felt his superiority in
externals, strangely and painfully, for an instant. Then something
uprose within him, and told him, that "a man's a man for a' that,
for a' that, and twice as much as a' that." And he no longer felt
troubled by the outward appearance of his rival.

Harry Carson came on, lightly bounding over the dirty places with
almost a lad's buoyancy. To his surprise the dark, sturdy-looking
artisan stopped him by saying respectfully,

"May I speak a word wi' you, sir?"

"Certainly, my good man," looking his astonishment; then finding that
the promised speech did not come very quickly, he added, "But make
haste, for I'm in a hurry."

Jem had cast about for some less abrupt way of broaching the subject
uppermost in his mind than he now found himself obliged to use. With
a husky voice that trembled as he spoke, he said,

"I think, sir, yo're keeping company wi' a young woman called Mary
Barton?"

A light broke in upon Harry Carson's mind, and he paused before he
gave the answer for which the other waited.

Could this man be a lover of Mary's? And (strange, stinging thought)
could he be beloved by her, and so have caused her obstinate
rejection of himself? He looked at Jem from head to foot, a black,
grimy mechanic, in dirty fustian clothes, strongly built, and awkward
(according to the dancing-master); then he glanced at himself, and
recalled the reflection he had so lately quitted in his bed-room.
It was impossible. No woman with eyes could choose the one when the
other wooed. It was Hyperion to a Satyr. That quotation came aptly;
he forgot "That a man's a man for a' that." And yet here was a clue,
which he had often wanted, to her changed conduct towards him. If she
loved this man. If-- he hated the fellow, and longed to strike him.
He would know all.

"Mary Barton! let me see. Ay, that is the name of the girl. An arrant
flirt, the little hussy is; but very pretty. Ay, Mary Barton is her
name."

Jem bit his lips. Was it then so; that Mary was a flirt, the giddy
creature of whom he spoke? He would not believe it, and yet how he
wished the suggestive words unspoken. That thought must keep now,
though. Even if she were, the more reason for there being some one to
protect her; poor, faulty darling.

"She's a good girl, sir, though may be a bit set up with her beauty;
but she's her father's only child, sir, and--" he stopped; he did
not like to express suspicion, and yet he was determined he would be
certain there was ground for none. What should he say?

"Well, my fine fellow, and what have I to do with that? It's but loss
of my time, and yours, too, if you've only stopped me to tell me Mary
Barton is very pretty; I know that well enough."

He seemed as though he would have gone on, but Jem put his black,
working, right hand upon his arm to detain him. The haughty young man
shook it off, and with his glove pretended to brush away the sooty
contamination that might be left upon his light great-coat sleeve.
The little action aroused Jem.

"I will tell you in plain words what I have got to say to you, young
man. It's been telled me by one as knows, and has seen, that you walk
with this same Mary Barton, and are known to be courting her; and her
as spoke to me about it, thinks as how Mary loves you. That may be,
or may not. But I'm an old friend of hers, and her father's; and I
just wished to know if you mean to marry the girl. Spite of what you
said of her lightness, I ha' known her long enough to be sure she'll
make a noble wife for any one, let him be what he may; and I mean
to stand by her like a brother; and if you mean rightly, you'll not
think the worse on me for what I've now said; and if--but no, I'll
not say what I'll do to the man who wrongs a hair of her head. He
shall rue it the longest day he lives, that's all. Now, sir, what
I ask of you is this. If you mean fair and honourable by her, well
and good; but if not, for your own sake as well as hers, leave her
alone, and never speak to her more." Jem's voice quivered with the
earnestness with which he spoke, and he eagerly waited for some
answer.

Harry Carson, meanwhile, instead of attending very particularly to
the purpose the man had in addressing him, was trying to gather from
his speech what was the real state of the case. He succeeded so far
as to comprehend that Jem inclined to believe that Mary loved his
rival; and consequently, that if the speaker were attached to her
himself, he was not a favoured admirer. The idea came into Mr.
Carson's mind, that perhaps, after all, Mary loved him in spite of
her frequent and obstinate rejections; and that she had employed this
person (whoever he was) to bully him into marrying her. He resolved
to try and ascertain more correctly the man's relation to her. Either
he was a lover, and if so, not a favoured one (in which case Mr.
Carson could not at all understand the man's motives for interesting
himself in securing her marriage); or he was a friend, an accomplice,
whom she had employed to bully him. So little faith in goodness have
the mean and selfish!

"Before I make you into my confidant, my good man," said Mr. Carson,
in a contemptuous tone, "I think it might be as well to inquire your
right to meddle with our affairs. Neither Mary nor I, as I conceive,
called you in as a mediator." He paused; he wanted a distinct answer
to this last supposition. None came; so he began to imagine he was to
be threatened into some engagement, and his angry spirit rose.

"And so, my fine fellow, you will have the kindness to leave us to
ourselves, and not meddle with what does not concern you. If you were
a brother, or father of hers, the case might have been different. As
it is, I can only consider you an impertinent meddler."

Again he would have passed on, but Jem stood in a determined way
before him, saying,

"You say if I had been her brother, or her father, you'd have
answered me what I ask. Now, neither father nor brother could love
her as I have loved her, ay, and as I love her still; if love gives a
right to satisfaction, it's next to impossible any one breathing can
come up to my right. Now, sir, tell me! do you mean fair by Mary or
not? I've proved my claim to know, and, by G----, I will know."

"Come, come, no impudence," replied Mr. Carson, who, having
discovered what he wanted to know (namely, that Jem was a lover of
Mary's, and that she was not encouraging his suit), wished to pass
on.

"Father, brother, or rejected lover" (with an emphasis on the word
rejected), "no one has a right to interfere between my little
girl and me. No one shall. Confound you, man! get out of my way,
or I'll make you," as Jem still obstructed his path with dogged
determination.

"I won't, then, till you've given me your word about Mary," replied
the mechanic, grinding his words out between his teeth, and the livid
paleness of the anger he could no longer keep down covering his face
till he looked ghastly.

"Won't you?" (with a taunting laugh), "then I'll make you." The young
man raised his slight cane, and smote the artisan across the face
with a stinging stroke. An instant afterwards he lay stretched in the
muddy road, Jem standing over him, panting with rage. What he would
have done next in his moment of ungovernable passion, no one knows;
but a policeman from the main street, into which this road led, had
been sauntering about for some time, unobserved by either of the
parties, and expecting some kind of conclusion like the present to
the violent discussion going on between the two young men. In a
minute he had pinioned Jem, who sullenly yielded to the surprise.

Mr. Carson was on his feet directly, his face glowing with rage or
shame.

"Shall I take him to the lock-ups for assault, sir?" said the
policeman.

"No, no," exclaimed Mr. Carson; "I struck him first. It was no
assault on his side; though," he continued, hissing out his words
to Jem, who even hated freedom procured for him, however justly, at
the intervention of his rival, "I will never forgive or forget your
insult. Trust me," he gasped the words in excess of passion, "Mary
shall fare no better for your insolent interference." He laughed, as
if with the consciousness of power.

Jem replied with equal excitement--"And if you dare to injure her in
the least, I will await you where no policeman can step in between.
And God shall judge between us two."

The policeman now interfered with persuasions and warnings. He locked
his arm in Jem's to lead him away in an opposite direction to that in
which he saw Mr. Carson was going. Jem submitted gloomily, for a few
steps, then wrenched himself free. The policeman shouted after him,

"Take care, my man! there's no girl on earth worth what you'll be
bringing on yourself if you don't mind."

But Jem was out of hearing.




CHAPTER XVI.

MEETING BETWEEN MASTERS AND WORKMEN.


   "Not for a moment take the scorner's chair;
   While seated there, thou know'st not how a word,
   A tone, a look, may gall thy brother's heart,
   And make him turn in bitterness against thee."

   "LOVE-TRUTHS."


The day arrived on which the masters were to have an interview with
a deputation of the work-people. The meeting was to take place in
a public room, at an hotel; and there, about eleven o'clock, the
mill-owners, who had received the foreign orders, began to collect.

Of course, the first subject, however full their minds might be of
another, was the weather. Having done their duty by all the showers
and sunshine which had occurred during the past week, they fell to
talking about the business which brought them together. There might
be about twenty gentlemen in the room, including some by courtesy,
who were not immediately concerned in the settlement of the present
question; but who, nevertheless, were sufficiently interested to
attend. These were divided into little groups, who did not seem
unanimous by any means. Some were for a slight concession, just
a sugar-plum to quieten the naughty child, a sacrifice to peace
and quietness. Some were steadily and vehemently opposed to the
dangerous precedent of yielding one jot or one tittle to the outward
force of a turn-out. It was teaching the work-people how to become
masters, said they. Did they want the wildest thing heareafter, they
would know that the way to obtain their wishes would be to strike
work. Besides, one or two of those present had only just returned
from the New Bailey, where one of the turn-outs had been tried for a
cruel assault on a poor north-country weaver, who had attempted to
work at the low price. They were indignant, and justly so, at the
merciless manner in which the poor fellow had been treated; and their
indignation at wrong, took (as it so often does) the extreme form of
revenge. They felt as if, rather than yield to the body of men who
were resorting to such cruel measures towards their fellow-workmen,
they, the masters, would sooner relinquish all the benefits to be
derived from the fulfilment of the commission, in order that the
workmen might suffer keenly. They forgot that the strike was in this
instance the consequence of want and need, suffered unjustly, as the
endurers believed; for, however insane, and without ground of reason,
such was their belief, and such was the cause of their violence. It
is a great truth, that you cannot extinguish violence by violence.
You may put it down for a time; but while you are crowing over your
imaginary success, see if it does not return with seven devils worse
than its former self!

No one thought of treating the workmen as brethren and friends, and
openly, clearly, as appealing to reasonable men, stating the exact
and full circumstances which led the masters to think it was the wise
policy of the time to make sacrifices themselves, and to hope for
them from the operatives.

In going from group to group in the room, you caught such a medley of
sentences as the following:

"Poor devils! they're near enough to starving, I'm afraid. Mrs.
Aldred makes two cows' heads into soup every week, and people come
several miles to fetch it; and if these times last we must try and do
more. But we must not be bullied into any thing!"

"A rise of a shilling or so won't make much difference, and they will
go away thinking they've gained their point."

"That's the very thing I object to. They'll think so, and whenever
they've a point to gain, no matter how unreasonable, they'll strike
work."

"It really injures them more than us."

"I don't see how our interests can be separated."

"The d----d brute had thrown vitriol on the poor fellow's ankles, and
you know what a bad part that is to heal. He had to stand still with
the pain, and that left him at the mercy of the cruel wretch, who
beat him about the head till you'd hardly have known he was a man.
They doubt if he'll live."

"If it were only for that, I'll stand out against them, even if it
were the cause of my ruin."

"Ay, I for one won't yield one farthing to the cruel brutes; they're
more like wild beasts than human beings."

(Well! who might have made them different?)

"I say, Carson, just go and tell Duncombe of this fresh instance of
their abominable conduct. He's wavering, but I think this will decide
him."

The door was now opened, and a waiter announced that the men were
below, and asked if it were the pleasure of the gentlemen that they
should be shown up.

They assented, and rapidly took their places round the official
table; looking, as like as they could, to the Roman senators who
awaited the irruption of Brennus and his Gauls.

Tramp, tramp, came the heavy clogged feet up the stairs; and in a
minute five wild, earnest-looking men stood in the room. John Barton,
from some mistake as to time, was not among them. Had they been
larger boned men, you would have called them gaunt; as it was, they
were little of stature, and their fustian clothes hung loosely upon
their shrunk limbs. In choosing their delegates, too, the operatives
had had more regard to their brains, and power of speech, than to
their wardrobes; they might have read the opinions of that worthy
Professor Teufelsdruch, in Sartor Resartus, to judge from the
dilapidated coats and trousers, which yet clothed men of parts and
of power. It was long since many of them had known the luxury of a
new article of dress; and air-gaps were to be seen in their garments.
Some of the masters were rather affronted at such a ragged detachment
coming between the wind and their nobility; but what cared they?

At the request of a gentleman hastily chosen to officiate as
chairman, the leader of the delegates read, in a high-pitched,
psalm-singing voice, a paper, containing the operatives' statement of
the case at issue, their complaints, and their demands, which last
were not remarkable for moderation.

He was then desired to withdraw for a few minutes, with his fellow
delegates, to another room, while the masters considered what should
be their definitive answer.

When the men had left the room, a whispered earnest consultation
took place, every one re-urging his former arguments. The conceders
carried the day, but only by a majority of one. The minority
haughtily and audibly expressed their dissent from the measures to be
adopted, even after the delegates re-entered the room; their words
and looks did not pass unheeded by the quick-eyed operatives; their
names were registered in bitter hearts.

The masters could not consent to the advance demanded by the workmen.
They would agree to give one shilling per week more than they had
previously offered. Were the delegates empowered to accept such
offer?

They were empowered to accept or decline any offer made that day by
the masters.

Then it might be as well for them to consult among themselves as to
what should be their decision. They again withdrew.

It was not for long. They came back, and positively declined any
compromise of their demands.

Then up sprang Mr. Henry Carson, the head and voice of the violent
party among the masters, and addressing the chairman, even before
the scowling operatives, he proposed some resolutions, which he,
and those who agreed with him, had been concocting during this last
absence of the deputation.

They were, firstly, withdrawing the proposal just made, and declaring
all communication between the masters and that particular Trades'
Union at an end; secondly, declaring that no master would employ any
workman in future, unless he signed a declaration that he did not
belong to any Trades' Union, and pledged himself not to assist or
subscribe to any society, having for its object interference with
the masters' powers; and, thirdly, that the masters should pledge
themselves to protect and encourage all workmen willing to accept
employment on those conditions, and at the rate of wages first
offered. Considering that the men who now stood listening with
lowering brows of defiance were all of them leading members of the
Union, such resolutions were in themselves sufficiently provocative
of animosity: but not content with simply stating them, Harry Carson
went on to characterise the conduct of the workmen in no measured
terms; every word he spoke rendering their looks more livid, their
glaring eyes more fierce. One among them would have spoken, but
checked himself in obedience to the stern glance and pressure on his
arm, received from the leader. Mr. Carson sat down, and a friend
instantly got up to second the motion. It was carried, but far from
unanimously. The chairman announced it to the delegates (who had been
once more turned out of the room for a division). They received it
with deep brooding silence, but spake never a word, and left the room
without even a bow.

Now there had been some by-play at this meeting, not recorded in the
Manchester newspapers, which gave an account of the more regular part
of the transaction.

While the men had stood grouped near the door, on their first
entrance, Mr. Harry Carson had taken out his silver pencil, and had
drawn an admirable caricature of them--lank, ragged, dispirited, and
famine-stricken. Underneath he wrote a hasty quotation from the fat
knight's well-known speech in Henry IV. He passed it to one of his
neighbours, who acknowledged the likeness instantly, and by him it
was sent round to others, who all smiled and nodded their heads.
When it came back to its owner he tore the back of the letter on
which it was drawn, in two; twisted them up, and flung them into
the fire-place; but, careless whether they reached their aim or not,
he did not look to see that they fell just short of any consuming
cinders.

This proceeding was closely observed by one of the men.

He watched the masters as they left the hotel (laughing, some of them
were, at passing jokes), and when all had gone, he re-entered. He
went to the waiter, who recognised him.

"There's a bit on a picture up yonder, as one o' the gentlemen threw
away; I've a little lad at home as dearly loves a picture; by your
leave I'll go up for it."

The waiter, good-natured and sympathetic, accompanied him up-stairs;
saw the paper picked up and untwisted, and then being convinced, by
a hasty glance at its contents, that it was only what the man had
called it, "a bit of a picture," he allowed him to bear away his
prize.

Towards seven o'clock that evening many operatives began to assemble
in a room in the Weavers' Arms public-house, a room appropriated for
"festive occasions," as the landlord, in his circular, on opening the
premises, had described it. But, alas! it was on no festive occasion
that they met there on this night. Starved, irritated, despairing
men, they were assembling to hear the answer that morning given by
the masters to their delegates; after which, as was stated in the
notice, a gentleman from London would have the honour of addressing
the meeting on the present state of affairs between the employers
and the employed, or (as he chose to term them) the idle and the
industrious classes. The room was not large, but its bareness of
furniture made it appear so. Unshaded gas flared down upon the lean
and unwashed artisans as they entered, their eyes blinking at the
excess of light.

They took their seats on benches, and awaited the deputation. The
latter, gloomily and ferociously, delivered the masters' ultimatum,
adding thereunto not one word of their own; and it sank all the
deeper into the sore hearts of the listeners for their forbearance.

Then the "gentleman from London" (who had been previously informed of
the masters' decision) entered. You would have been puzzled to define
his exact position, or what was the state of his mind as regarded
education. He looked so self-conscious, so far from earnest, among
the group of eager, fierce, absorbed men, among whom he now stood. He
might have been a disgraced medical student of the Bob Sawyer class,
or an unsuccessful actor, or a flashy shopman. The impression he
would have given you would have been unfavourable, and yet there was
much about him that could only be characterised as doubtful.

He smirked in acknowledgment of their uncouth greetings, and sat
down; then glancing round, he inquired whether it would not be
agreeable to the gentlemen present to have pipes and liquor handed
round; adding, that he would stand treat.

As the man who has had his taste educated to love reading, falls
devouringly upon books after a long abstinence, so these poor
fellows, whose tastes had been left to educate themselves into a
liking for tobacco, beer, and similar gratifications, gleamed up at
the proposal of the London delegate. Tobacco and drink deaden the
pangs of hunger, and make one forget the miserable home, the desolate
future.

They were now ready to listen to him with approbation. He felt it;
and rising like a great orator, with his right arm outstretched, his
left in the breast of his waistcoat, he began to declaim, with a
forced theatrical voice.

After a burst of eloquence, in which he blended the deeds of
the elder and the younger Brutus, and magnified the resistless
might of the "millions of Manchester," the Londoner descended to
matter-of-fact business, and in his capacity this way he did not
belie the good judgment of those who had sent him as delegate.
Masses of people, when left to their own free choice, seem to have
discretion in distinguishing men of natural talent; it is a pity
they so little regard temper and principles. He rapidly dictated
resolutions, and suggested measures. He wrote out a stirring
placard for the walls. He proposed sending delegates to entreat the
assistance of other Trades' Unions in other towns. He headed the list
of subscribing Unions, by a liberal donation from that with which
he was especially connected in London; and what was more, and more
uncommon, he paid down the money in real, clinking, blinking, golden
sovereigns! The money, alas, was cravingly required; but before
alleviating any private necessities on the morrow, small sums were
handed to each of the delegates, who were in a day or two to set out
on their expeditions to Glasgow, Newcastle, Nottingham, &c. These
men were most of them members of the deputation who had that morning
waited upon the masters. After he had drawn up some letters, and
spoken a few more stirring words, the gentleman from London withdrew,
previously shaking hands all round; and many speedily followed him
out of the room, and out of the house.

The newly-appointed delegates, and one or two others, remained behind
to talk over their respective missions, and to give and exchange
opinions in more homely and natural language than they dared to use
before the London orator.

"He's a rare chap, yon," began one, indicating the departed delegate
by a jerk of his thumb towards the door. "He's gotten the gift of the
gab, anyhow!"

"Ay! ay! he knows what he's about. See how he poured it into us about
that there Brutus. He were pretty hard, too, to kill his own son!"

"I could kill mine if he took part wi' the masters; to be sure, he's
but a step-son, but that makes no odds," said another.

But now tongues were hushed, and all eyes were directed towards the
member of the deputation who had that morning returned to the hotel
to obtain possession of Harry Carson's clever caricature of the
operatives.

The heads clustered together, to gaze at and detect the likenesses.

"That's John Slater! I'd ha' known him anywhere, by his big nose.
Lord! how like; that's me, by G----, it's the very way I'm obligated
to pin my waistcoat up, to hide that I've gotten no shirt. That _is_
a shame, and I'll not stand it."

"Well!" said John Slater, after having acknowledged his nose and his
likeness; "I could laugh at a jest as well as e'er the best on 'em,
though it did tell again mysel, if I were not clemming" (his eyes
filled with tears; he was a poor, pinched, sharp-featured man, with
a gentle and melancholy expression of countenance), "and if I could
keep from thinking of them at home, as is clemming; but with their
cries for food ringing in my ears, and making me afeard of going
home, and wonder if I should hear 'em wailing out, if I lay cold and
drowned at th' bottom o' th' canal, there,--why, man, I cannot laugh
at ought. It seems to make me sad that there is any as can make game
on what they've never knowed; as can make such laughable pictures on
men, whose very hearts within 'em are so raw and sore as ours were
and are, God help us."

John Barton began to speak; they turned to him with great attention.
"It makes me more than sad, it makes my heart burn within me, to see
that folk can make a jest of earnest men; of chaps who comed to ask
for a bit o' fire for th' old granny, as shivers in th' cold; for a
bit o' bedding, and some warm clothing to the poor wife as lies in
labour on th' damp flags; and for victuals for the childer, whose
little voices are getting too faint and weak to cry aloud wi' hunger.
For, brothers, is not them the things we ask for when we ask for more
wage? We donnot want dainties, we want bellyfuls; we donnot want
gimcrack coats and waistcoats, we want warm clothes, and so that we
get 'em we'd not quarrel wi' what they're made on. We donnot want
their grand houses, we want a roof to cover us from the rain, and the
snow, and the storm; ay, and not alone to cover us, but the helpless
ones that cling to us in the keen wind, and ask us with their eyes
why we brought 'em into th' world to suffer?" He lowered his deep
voice almost to a whisper.

"I've seen a father who had killed his child rather than let it clem
before his eyes; and he were a tender-hearted man."

He began again in his usual tone. "We come to th' masters wi' full
hearts, to ask for them things I named afore. We know that they've
gotten money, as we've earned for 'em; we know trade is mending, and
that they've large orders, for which they'll be well paid; we ask for
our share o' th' payment; for, say we, if th' masters get our share
of payment it will only go to keep servants and horses, to more dress
and pomp. Well and good, if yo choose to be fools we'll not hinder
you, so long as you're just; but our share we must and will have;
we'll not be cheated. _We_ want it for daily bread, for life itself;
and not for our own lives neither (for there's many a one here, I
know by mysel, as would be glad and thankful to lie down and die out
o' this weary world), but for the lives of them little ones, who
don't yet know what life is, and are afeard of death. Well, we come
before th' masters to state what we want, and what we must have,
afore we'll set shoulder to their work; and they say, 'No.' One would
think that would be enough of hard-heartedness, but it isn't. They go
and make jesting pictures of us! I could laugh at mysel, as well as
poor John Slater there; but then I must be easy in my mind to laugh.
Now I only know that I would give the last drop o' my blood to avenge
us on yon chap, who had so little feeling in him as to make game on
earnest, suffering men!"

A low angry murmur was heard among the men, but it did not yet take
form or words. John continued--

"You'll wonder, chaps, how I came to miss the time this morning; I'll
just tell you what I was a-doing. Th' chaplain at the New Bailey sent
and gived me an order to see Jonas Higginbotham; him as was taken
up last week for throwing vitriol in a knob-stick's face. Well, I
couldn't help but go; and I didn't reckon it would ha' kept me so
late. Jonas were like one crazy when I got to him; he said he could
na get rest night or day for th' face of the poor fellow he had
damaged; then he thought on his weak, clemmed look, as he tramped,
foot-sore, into town; and Jonas thought, may be, he had left them
at home as would look for news, and hope and get none, but, haply,
tidings of his death. Well, Jonas had thought on these things till he
could not rest, but walked up and down continually like a wild beast
in his cage. At last he bethought him on a way to help a bit, and he
got th' chaplain to send for me; and he telled me this; and that th'
man were lying in th' Infirmary, and he bade me go (to-day's the day
as folk may be admitted into th' Infirmary) and get his silver watch,
as was his mother's, and sell it as well as I could, and take the
money, and bid the poor knob-stick send it to his friends beyond
Burnley; and I were to take him Jonas's kind regards, and he humbly
axed him to forgive him. So I did what Jonas wished. But bless your
life, none on us would ever throw vitriol again (at least at a
knob-stick) if they could see the sight I saw to-day. The man lay,
his face all wrapped in cloths, so I didn't see _that_; but not a
limb, nor a bit of a limb, could keep from quivering with pain. He
would ha' bitten his hand to keep down his moans, but couldn't, his
face hurt him so if he moved it e'er so little. He could scarce mind
me when I telled him about Jonas; he did squeeze my hand when I
jingled the money, but when I axed his wife's name he shrieked out,
'Mary, Mary, shall I never see you again? Mary, my darling, they've
made me blind because I wanted to work for you and our own baby; oh,
Mary, Mary!' Then the nurse came, and said he were raving, and that I
had made him worse. And I'm afeard it was true; yet I were loth to go
without knowing where to send the money. . . . So that kept me beyond
my time, chaps."

"Did yo hear where the wife lived at last?" asked many anxious
voices.

"No! he went on talking to her, till his words cut my heart like a
knife. I axed th' nurse to find out who she was, and where she lived.
But what I'm more especial naming it now for is this,--for one thing
I wanted yo all to know why I weren't at my post this morning; for
another, I wish to say, that I, for one, ha' seen enough of what
comes of attacking knob-sticks, and I'll ha nought to do with it no
more."

There were some expressions of disapprobation, but John did not mind
them.

"Nay! I'm no coward," he replied, "and I'm true to th' backbone. What
I would like, and what I would do, would be to fight the masters.
There's one among yo called me a coward. Well! every man has a right
to his opinion; but since I've thought on th' matter to-day, I've
thought we han all on us been more like cowards in attacking the poor
like ourselves; them as has none to help, but mun choose between
vitriol and starvation. I say we're more cowardly in doing that than
in leaving them alone. No! what I would do is this. Have at the
masters!" Again he shouted, "Have at the masters!" He spoke lower;
all listened with hushed breath.

"It's the masters as has wrought this woe; it's the masters as should
pay for it. Him as called me coward just now, may try if I am one or
not. Set me to serve out the masters, and see if there's ought I'll
stick at."

"It would give th' masters a bit on a fright if one on them were
beaten within an inch of his life," said one.

"Ay! or beaten till no life were left in him," growled another.

And so with words, or looks that told more than words, they built up
a deadly plan. Deeper and darker grew the import of their speeches,
as they stood hoarsely muttering their meaning out, and glaring, with
eyes that told the terror their own thoughts were to them, upon their
neighbours. Their clenched fists, their set teeth, their livid looks,
all told the suffering their minds were voluntarily undergoing in
the contemplation of crime, and in familiarising themselves with its
details.

Then came one of those fierce terrible oaths which bind members
of Trades' Unions to any given purpose. Then, under the flaring
gaslight, they met together to consult further. With the distrust
of guilt, each was suspicious of his neighbour; each dreaded the
treachery of another. A number of pieces of paper (the identical
letter on which the caricature had been drawn that very morning) were
torn up, and _one was marked_. Then all were folded up again, looking
exactly alike. They were shuffled together in a hat. The gas was
extinguished; each drew out a paper. The gas was re-lighted. Then
each went as far as he could from his fellows, and examined the paper
he had drawn without saying a word, and with a countenance as stony
and immovable as he could make it.

Then, still rigidly silent, they each took up their hats and went
every one his own way.

He who had drawn the marked paper had drawn the lot of the assassin!
and he had sworn to act according to his drawing! But no one save God
and his own conscience knew who was the appointed murderer!




CHAPTER XVII.

BARTON'S NIGHT-ERRAND.


   "Mournful is't to say Farewell,
     Though for few brief hours we part;
   In that absence, who can tell
     What may come to wring the heart!"

   ANONYMOUS.


The events recorded in the last chapter took place on a Tuesday. On
Thursday afternoon Mary was surprised, in the midst of some little
bustle in which she was engaged, by the entrance of Will Wilson.
He looked strange, at least it was strange to see any different
expression on his face to his usual joyous beaming appearance. He had
a paper parcel in his hand. He came in, and sat down, more quietly
than usual.

"Why, Will! what's the matter with you? You seem quite cut up about
something!"

"And I am, Mary! I'm come to say good-bye; and few folk like to say
good-bye to them they love."

"Good-bye! Bless me, Will, that's sudden, isn't it?"

Mary left off ironing, and came and stood near the fire-place. She
had always liked Will; but now it seemed as if a sudden spring of
sisterly love had gushed up in her heart, so sorry did she feel to
hear of his approaching departure.

"It's very sudden, isn't it?" said she, repeating her question.

"Yes! it's very sudden," said he, dreamily. "No, it isn't;" rousing
himself, to think of what he was saying. "The captain told me in a
fortnight he would be ready to sail again; but it comes very sudden
on me, I had got so fond of you all."

Mary understood the particular fondness that was thus generalised.
She spoke again.

"But it's not a fortnight since you came. Not a fortnight since you
knocked at Jane Wilson's door, and I was there, you remember. Nothing
like a fortnight!"

"No; I know it's not. But, you see, I got a letter this afternoon
from Jack Harris, to tell me our ship sails on Tuesday next; and it's
long since I promised my uncle (my mother's brother, him that lives
at Kirk-Christ, beyond Ramsay, in the Isle of Man) that I'd go and
see him and his, this time of coming ashore. I must go. I'm sorry
enough; but I mustn't slight poor mother's friends. I must go. Don't
try to keep me," said he, evidently fearing the strength of his own
resolution, if hard pressed by entreaty.

"I'm not a-going, Will. I dare say you're right; only I can't help
feeling sorry you're going away. It seems so flat to be left behind.
When do you go?"

"To-night. I shan't see you again."

"To-night! and you go to Liverpool! May be you and father will go
together. He's going to Glasgow, by way of Liverpool."

"No! I'm walking; and I don't think your father will be up to
walking."

"Well! and why on earth are you walking? You can get by railway for
three-and-sixpence."

"Ay, but Mary! (thou mustn't let out what I'm going to tell thee) I
haven't got three shillings, no, nor even a sixpence left, at least
not here; before I came here I gave my landlady enough to carry me to
the island and back, and may be a trifle for presents, and I brought
all the rest here; and it's all gone but this," jingling a few
coppers in his hand.

"Nay, never fret over my walking a matter of thirty mile," added he,
as he saw she looked grave and sorry. "It's a fine clear night, and
I shall set off betimes, and get in afore the Manx packet sails.
Where's your father going? To Glasgow, did you say? Perhaps he and
I may have a bit of a trip together then, for, if the Manx boat has
sailed when I get into Liverpool, I shall go by a Scotch packet.
What's he going to do in Glasgow?--Seek for work? Trade is as bad
there as here, folk say."

"No; he knows that," answered Mary, sadly. "I sometimes think he'll
never get work again, and that trade will never mend. It's very hard
to keep up one's heart. I wish I were a boy, I'd go to sea with you.
It would be getting away from bad news at any rate; and now, there's
hardly a creature that crosses the door-step, but has something
sad and unhappy to tell one. Father is going as a delegate from
his Union, to ask help from the Glasgow folk. He's starting this
evening."

Mary sighed, for the feeling again came over her that it was very
flat to be left alone.

"You say no one crosses the threshold but has something sad to say;
you don't mean that Margaret Jennings has any trouble?" asked the
young sailor, anxiously.

"No!" replied Mary, smiling a little, "she's the only one I know,
I believe, who seems free from care. Her blindness almost appears
a blessing sometimes; she was so downhearted when she dreaded it,
and now she seems so calm and happy when it's downright come. No!
Margaret's happy, I do think."

"I could almost wish it had been otherwise," said Will, thoughtfully.
"I could have been so glad to comfort her, and cherish her, if she
had been in trouble."

"And why can't you cherish her, even though she is happy?" asked
Mary.

"Oh! I don't know. She seems so much better than I am! And her voice!
When I hear it, and think of the wishes that are in my heart, it
seems as much out of place to ask her to be my wife, as it would be
to ask an angel from heaven."

Mary could not help laughing outright, in spite of her depression, at
the idea of Margaret as an angel; it was so difficult (even to her
dress-making imagination) to fancy where, and how, the wings would be
fastened to the brown stuff gown, or the blue and yellow print.

Will laughed, too, a little, out of sympathy with Mary's pretty merry
laugh. Then he said--

"Ay, you may laugh, Mary; it only shows you've never been in love."

In an instant Mary was carnation colour, and the tears sprang to her
soft gray eyes; she was suffering so much from the doubts arising
from love! It was unkind of him. He did not notice her change of
look and of complexion. He only noticed that she was silent, so he
continued:

"I thought--I think, that when I come back from this voyage, I will
speak. It's my fourth voyage in the same ship, and with the same
captain, and he's promised he'll make me second mate after this trip;
then I shall have something to offer Margaret; and her grandfather,
and aunt Alice, shall live with her, to keep her from being lonesome
while I'm at sea. I'm speaking as if she cared for me, and would
marry me; d'ye think she does care at all for me, Mary?" asked he,
anxiously.

Mary had a very decided opinion of her own on the subject, but she
did not feel as if she had any right to give it. So she said--

"You must ask Margaret, not me, Will; she's never named your name to
me." His countenance fell. "But I should say that was a good sign
from a girl like her. I've no right to say what I think; but, if I
was you, I would not leave her now without speaking."

"No! I cannot speak! I have tried. I've been in to wish them
good-bye, and my voice stuck in my throat. I could say nought of what
I'd planned to say; and I never thought of being so bold as to offer
her marriage till I'd been my next trip, and been made mate. I could
not even offer her this box," said he, undoing his paper parcel and
displaying a gaudily ornamented accordion; "I longed to buy her
something, and I thought, if it were something in the music line, she
would may-be fancy it more. So, will you give it to her, Mary, when
I'm gone? and, if you can slip in something tender,--something, you
know, of what I feel,--may-be she would listen to you, Mary."

Mary promised that she would do all that he asked.

"I shall be thinking on her many and many a night, when I'm keeping
my watch in mid-sea; I wonder if she will ever think on me when the
wind is whistling, and the gale rising. You'll often speak of me to
her, Mary? And if I should meet with any mischance, tell her how
dear, how very dear, she was to me, and bid her, for the sake of one
who loved her well, try and comfort my poor aunt Alice. Dear old
aunt! you and Margaret will often go and see her, won't you? She's
sadly failed since I was last ashore. And so good as she has been!
When I lived with her, a little wee chap, I used to be wakened by the
neighbours knocking her up; this one was ill, or that body's child
was restless; and, for as tired as ever she might be, she would be
up and dressed in a twinkling, never thinking of the hard day's wash
afore her next morning. Them were happy times! How pleased I used to
be when she would take me into the fields with her to gather herbs!
I've tasted tea in China since then, but it wasn't half so good as
the herb tea she used to make for me o' Sunday nights. And she knew
such a deal about plants and birds, and their ways! She used to tell
me long stories about her childhood, and we used to plan how we would
go sometime, please God (that was always her word), and live near her
old home beyond Lancaster; in the very cottage where she was born if
we could get it. Dear! and how different it is! Here is she still in
a back street o' Manchester, never likely to see her own home again;
and I, a sailor, off for America next week. I wish she had been able
to go to Burton once afore she died."

"She would may be have found all sadly changed," said Mary, though
her heart echoed Will's feeling.

"Ay! ay! I dare say it's best. One thing I do wish though, and I have
often wished it when out alone on the deep sea, when even the most
thoughtless can't choose but think on th' past and th' future; and
that is, that I'd never grieved her. Oh Mary! many a hasty word comes
sorely back on the heart, when one thinks one shall never see the
person whom one has grieved again!"

They both stood thinking. Suddenly Mary started.

"That's father's step. And his shirt's not ready!"

She hurried to her irons, and tried to make up for lost time.

John Barton came in. Such a haggard and wildly anxious looking man,
Will thought he had never seen. He looked at Will, but spoke no word
of greeting or welcome.

"I'm come to bid you good bye," said the sailor, and would in his
sociable friendly humour have gone on speaking. But John answered
abruptly,

"Good bye to ye, then."

There was that in his manner which left no doubt of his desire to get
rid of the visitor, and Will accordingly shook hands with Mary, and
looked at John, as if doubting how far to offer to shake hands with
him. But he met with no answering glance or gesture, so he went his
way, stopping for an instant at the door to say,

"You'll think on me on Tuesday, Mary. That's the day we shall hoist
our blue Peter, Jack Harris says."

Mary was heartily sorry when the door closed; it seemed like shutting
out a friendly sunbeam. And her father! what could be the matter with
him? He was so restless; not speaking (she wished he would), but
starting up and then sitting down, and meddling with her irons; he
seemed so fierce, too, to judge from his face. She wondered if he
disliked Will being there; or if he were vexed to find that she had
not got further on with her work. At last she could bear his nervous
way no longer, it made her equally nervous and fidgetty. She would
speak.

"When are you going, father? I don't know the time o' the trains."

"And why shouldst thou know?" replied he, gruffly. "Meddle with thy
ironing, but donnot be asking questions about what doesn't concern
thee."

"I wanted to get you something to eat first," answered she, gently.

"Thou dost not know that I'm larning to do without food," said he.

Mary looked at him to see if he spoke jestingly. No! he looked
savagely grave.

She finished her bit of ironing, and began preparing the food she
was sure her father needed; for by this time her experience in the
degrees of hunger had taught her that his present irritability was
increased, if not caused, by want of food.

He had had a sovereign given him to pay his expenses as delegate to
Glasgow, and out of this he had given Mary a few shillings in the
morning; so she had been able to buy a sufficient meal, and now her
care was to cook it so as most to tempt him.

"If thou'rt doing that for me, Mary, thou may'st spare thy labour. I
telled thee I were not for eating."

"Just a little bit, father, before starting," coaxed Mary,
perseveringly.

At that instant, who should come in but Job Legh. It was not often he
came, but when he did pay visits, Mary knew from past experience they
were any thing but short. Her father's countenance fell back into
the deep gloom from which it was but just emerging at the sound of
Mary's sweet voice, and pretty pleading. He became again restless and
fidgetty, scarcely giving Job Legh the greeting necessary for a host
in his own house. Job, however, did not stand upon ceremony. He had
come to pay a visit, and was not to be daunted from his purpose. He
was interested in John Barton's mission to Glasgow, and wanted to
hear all about it; so he sat down, and made himself comfortable, in a
manner that Mary saw was meant to be stationary.

"So thou'rt off to Glasgow, art thou?" he began his catechism.

"Ay."

"When art starting?"

"To-night."

"That I knowed. But by what train?"

That was just what Mary wanted to know; but what apparently her
father was in no mood to tell. He got up without speaking, and
went up-stairs. Mary knew from his step, and his way, how much he
was put out, and feared Job would see it, too. But no! Job seemed
imperturbable. So much the better, and perhaps she could cover her
father's rudeness by her own civility to so kind a friend.

So half listening to her father's movements up-stairs, (passionate,
violent, restless motions they were) and half attending to Job Legh,
she tried to pay him all due regard.

"When does thy father start, Mary?"

That plaguing question again.

"Oh! very soon. I'm just getting him a bit of supper. Is Margaret
very well?"

"Yes, she's well enough. She's meaning to go and keep Alice Wilson
company for an hour or so this evening; as soon as she thinks her
nephew will have started for Liverpool; for she fancies the old woman
will feel a bit lonesome. Th' Union is paying for your father, I
suppose?"

"Yes, they've given him a sovereign. You're one of th' Union, Job?"

"Ay! I'm one, sure enough; but I'm but a sleeping partner in the
concern. I were obliged to become a member for peace, else I don't go
along with 'em. Yo see they think themselves wise, and me silly, for
differing with them; well! there's no harm in that. But then they
won't let me be silly in peace and quietness, but will force me to
be as wise as they are; now that's not British liberty, I say. I'm
forced to be wise according to their notions, else they parsecute me,
and sarve me out."

What could her father be doing up-stairs? Tramping and banging about.
Why did he not come down? Or why did not Job go? The supper would be
spoilt.

But Job had no notion of going.

"You see my folly is this, Mary. I would take what I could get; I
think half a loaf is better than no bread. I would work for low wages
rather than sit idle and starve. But, comes the Trades' Union, and
says, 'Well, if you take the half-loaf, we'll worry you out of your
life. Will you be clemmed, or will you be worried?' Now clemming is a
quiet death, and worrying isn't, so I choose clemming, and come into
th' Union. But I wish they'd leave me free, if I am a fool."

Creak, creak, went the stairs. Her father was coming down at last.

Yes, he came down, but more doggedly fierce than before, and made up
for his journey, too; with his little bundle on his arm. He went up
to Job, and, more civilly than Mary expected, wished him good-bye. He
then turned to her, and in a short cold manner, bade her farewell.

"Oh! father, don't go yet. Your supper is all ready. Stay one
moment!"

But he pushed her away, and was gone. She followed him to the door,
her eyes blinded by sudden tears; she stood there looking after him.
He was so strange, so cold, so hard. Suddenly, at the end of the
court, he turned, and saw her standing there; he came back quickly,
and took her in his arms.

"God bless thee, Mary!--God in heaven bless thee, poor child!" She
threw her arms round his neck.

"Don't go yet, father; I can't bear you to go yet. Come in, and eat
some supper; you look so ghastly; dear father, do!"

"No," he said, faintly and mournfully. "It's best as it is. I
couldn't eat, and it's best to be off. I cannot be still at home.
I must be moving."

So saying, he unlaced her soft twining arms, and kissing her once
more, set off on his fierce errand.

And he was out of sight! She did not know why, but she had never
before felt so depressed, so desolate. She turned in to Job, who sat
there still. Her father, as soon as he was out of sight, slackened
his pace, and fell into that heavy listless step, which told as well
as words could do, of hopelessness and weakness. It was getting dark,
but he loitered on, returning no greeting to any one.

A child's cry caught his ear. His thoughts were running on little
Tom; on the dead and buried child of happier years. He followed the
sound of the wail, that might have been _his_, and found a poor
little mortal, who had lost his way, and whose grief had choked up
his thoughts to the single want, "Mammy, mammy." With tender address,
John Barton soothed the little laddie, and with beautiful patience he
gathered fragments of meaning from the half spoken words which came
mingled with sobs from the terrified little heart. So, aided by
inquiries here and there from a passer-by, he led and carried the
little fellow home, where his mother had been too busy to miss him,
but now received him with thankfulness, and with an eloquent Irish
blessing. When John heard the words of blessing, he shook his head
mournfully, and turned away to retrace his steps.

Let us leave him.

Mary took her sewing after he had gone, and sat on, and sat on,
trying to listen to Job, who was more inclined to talk than usual.
She had conquered her feeling of impatience towards him so far as to
be able to offer him her father's rejected supper; and she even tried
to eat herself. But her heart failed her. A leaden weight seemed to
hang over her; a sort of presentiment of evil, or perhaps only an
excess of low-spirited feeling in consequence of the two departures
which had taken place that afternoon.

She wondered how long Job Legh would sit. She did not like putting
down her work, and crying before him, and yet she had never in her
life longed so much to be alone in order to indulge in a good hearty
burst of tears.

"Well, Mary," she suddenly caught him saying, "I thought you'd be
a bit lonely to-night; and as Margaret were going to cheer th' old
woman, I said I'd go and keep th' young un company; and a very
pleasant, chatty evening we've had; very. Only I wonder as Margaret
is not come back."

"But perhaps she is," suggested Mary.

"No, no, I took care o' that. Look ye here!" and he pulled out the
great house-key. "She'll have to stand waiting i' th' street, and
that I'm sure she wouldn't do, when she knew where to find me."

"Will she come back by hersel?" asked Mary.

"Ay. At first I were afraid o' trusting her, and I used to follow her
a bit behind; never letting on, of course. But, bless you! she goes
along as steadily as can be; rather slow, to be sure, and her head a
bit on one side as if she were listening. And it's real beautiful to
see her cross the road. She'll wait above a bit to hear that all is
still; not that she's so dark as not to see a coach or a cart like
a big black thing, but she can't rightly judge how far off it is by
sight, so she listens. Hark! that's her!"

Yes; in she came with her usually calm face all tear-stained and
sorrow-marked.

"What's the matter, my wench?" said Job, hastily.

"Oh! grandfather! Alice Wilson's so bad!" She could say no more, for
her breathless agitation. The afternoon, and the parting with Will,
had weakened her nerves for any after-shock.

"What is it? Do tell us, Margaret!" said Mary, placing her in a
chair, and loosening her bonnet-strings.

"I think it's a stroke o' the palsy. Any rate she has lost the use of
one side."

"Was it afore Will had set off?" asked Mary.

"No; he were gone before I got there," said Margaret; "and she were
much about as well as she has been this many a day. She spoke a bit,
but not much; but that were only natural, for Mrs. Wilson likes to
have the talk to hersel, you know. She got up to go across the room,
and then I heard a drag wi' her leg, and presently a fall, and Mrs.
Wilson came running, and set up such a cry! I stopped wi' Alice,
while she fetched a doctor; but she could not speak, to answer me,
though she tried, I think."

"Where was Jem? Why didn't he go for the doctor?"

"He were out when I got there, and he never came home while I
stopped."

"Thou'st never left Mrs. Wilson alone wi' poor Alice?" asked Job,
hastily.

"No, no," said Margaret. "But, oh! grandfather; it's now I feel how
hard it is to have lost my sight. I should have so loved to nurse
her; and I did try, until I found I did more harm than good. Oh!
grandfather; if I could but see!"

She sobbed a little; and they let her give that ease to her heart.
Then she went on--

"No! I went round by Mrs. Davenport's, and she were hard at work;
but, the minute I told my errand, she were ready and willing to go to
Jane Wilson, and stop up all night with Alice."

"And what does the doctor say?" asked Mary.

"Oh! much what all doctors say: he puts a fence on this side, and a
fence on that, for fear he should be caught tripping in his judgment.
One moment he does not think there's much hope--but while there
is life there is hope; th' next he says he should think she might
recover partial, but her age is again her. He's ordered her leeches
to her head."

Margaret, having told her tale, leant back with weariness, both of
body and mind. Mary hastened to make her a cup of tea; while Job,
lately so talkative, sat quiet and mournfully silent.

"I'll go first thing to-morrow morning, and learn how she is; and
I'll bring word back before I go to work," said Mary.

"It's a bad job Will's gone," said Job.

"Jane does not think she knows any one," replied Margaret. "It's
perhaps as well he shouldn't see her now, for they say her face is
sadly drawn. He'll remember her with her own face better, if he does
not see her again."

With a few more sorrowful remarks they separated for the night, and
Mary was left alone in her house, to meditate on the heavy day that
had passed over her head. Everything seemed going wrong. Will gone;
her father gone--and so strangely too! And to a place so mysteriously
distant as Glasgow seemed to be to her! She had felt his presence
as a protection against Harry Carson and his threats; and now she
dreaded lest he should learn she was alone. Her heart began to
despair, too, about Jem. She feared he had ceased to love her; and
she--she only loved him more and more for his seeming neglect. And,
as if all this aggregate of sorrowful thoughts was not enough, here
was this new woe, of poor Alice's paralytic stroke.




CHAPTER XVIII.

MURDER.


   "But in his pulse there was no throb,
   Nor on his lips one dying sob;
   Sigh, nor word, nor struggling breath
   Heralded his way to death."

   SIEGE OF CORINTH.

   "My brain runs this way and that way; 'twill not fix
   On aught but vengeance."

   DUKE OF GUISE.


I must now go back to an hour or two before Mary and her friends
parted for the night. It might be about eight o'clock that
evening, and the three Miss Carsons were sitting in their father's
drawing-room. He was asleep in the dining-room, in his own
comfortable chair. Mrs. Carson was (as was usual with her, when
no particular excitement was going on) very poorly, and sitting
up-stairs in her dressing-room, indulging in the luxury of a
head-ache. She was not well, certainly. "Wind in the head," the
servants called it. But it was but the natural consequence of the
state of mental and bodily idleness in which she was placed. Without
education enough to value the resources of wealth and leisure, she
was so circumstanced as to command both. It would have done her more
good than all the æther and sal-volatile she was daily in the habit
of swallowing, if she might have taken the work of one of her own
housemaids for a week; made beds, rubbed tables, shaken carpets, and
gone out into the fresh morning air, without all the paraphernalia
of shawl, cloak, boa, fur boots, bonnet, and veil, in which she was
equipped before setting out for an "airing," in the closely shut-up
carriage.

So the three girls were by themselves in the comfortable, elegant,
well-lighted drawing-room; and, like many similarly-situated young
ladies, they did not exactly know what to do to while away the time
until the tea-hour. The elder two had been at a dancing-party the
night before, and were listless and sleepy in consequence. One tried
to read "Emerson's Essays," and fell asleep in the attempt; the other
was turning over a parcel of new music, in order to select what she
liked. Amy, the youngest, was copying some manuscript music. The air
was heavy with the fragrance of strongly-scented flowers, which sent
out their night odours from an adjoining conservatory.

The clock on the chimney-piece chimed eight. Sophy (the sleeping
sister) started up at the sound.

"What o'clock is that?" she asked.

"Eight," said Amy.

"Oh dear! how tired I am! Is Harry come in? Tea would rouse one up a
little. Are not you worn out, Helen?"

"Yes; I am tired enough. One is good for nothing the day after a
dance. Yet I don't feel weary at the time; I suppose it is the
lateness of the hours."

"And yet, how could it be managed otherwise? So many don't dine till
five or six, that one cannot begin before eight or nine; and then it
takes a long time to get into the spirit of the evening. It is always
more pleasant after supper than before."

"Well, I'm too tired to-night to reform the world in the matter of
dances or balls. What are you copying, Amy?"

"Only that little Spanish air you sing--'Quien quiera.'"

"What are you copying it for?" asked Helen.

"Harry asked me to do it for him this morning at breakfast-time,--for
Miss Richardson, he said."

"For Jane Richardson!" said Sophy, as if a new idea were receiving
strength in her mind.

"Do you think Harry means any thing by his attention to her?" asked
Helen.

"Nay, I do not know any thing more than you do; I can only observe
and conjecture. What do you think, Helen?"

"Harry always likes to be of consequence to the belle of the room.
If one girl is more admired than another, he likes to flutter about
her, and seem to be on intimate terms with her. That is his way,
and I have not noticed any thing beyond that in his manner to Jane
Richardson."

"But I don't think she knows it's only his way. Just watch her the
next time we meet her when Harry is there, and see how she crimsons,
and looks another way when she feels he is coming up to her. I think
he sees it, too, and I think he is pleased with it."

"I dare say Harry would like well enough to turn the head of such a
lovely girl as Jane Richardson. But I'm not convinced that he is in
love, whatever she may be."

"Well, then!" said Sophy, indignantly, "though it is our own brother,
I do think he is behaving very wrongly. The more I think of it the
more sure I am that she thinks he means something, and that he
intends her to think so. And then, when he leaves off paying her
attention--"

"Which will be as soon as a prettier girl makes her appearance,"
interrupted Helen.

"As soon as he leaves off paying her attention," resumed Sophy,
"she will have many and many a heart-ache, and then she will harden
herself into being a flirt, a feminine flirt, as he is a masculine
flirt. Poor girl!"

"I don't like to hear you speak so of Harry," said Amy, looking up at
Sophy.

"And I don't like to have to speak so, Amy, for I love him dearly.
He is a good, kind brother, but I do think him vain, and I think he
hardly knows the misery, the crimes, to which indulged vanity may
lead him."

Helen yawned.

"Oh! do you think we may ring for tea? Sleeping after dinner always
makes me so feverish."

"Yes, surely. Why should not we?" said the more energetic Sophy,
pulling the bell with some determination.

"Tea directly, Parker," said she, authoritatively, as the man entered
the room.

She was too little in the habit of reading expressions on the faces
of others to notice Parker's countenance.

Yet it was striking. It was blanched to a dead whiteness; the lips
compressed as if to keep within some tale of horror; the eyes
distended and unnatural. It was a terror-stricken face.

The girls began to put away their music and books, in preparation for
tea. The door slowly opened again, and this time it was the nurse who
entered. I call her nurse, for such had been her office in by-gone
days, though now she held rather an anomalous situation in the
family. Seamstress, attendant on the young ladies, keeper of the
stores; only "Nurse" was still her name. She had lived longer with
them than any other servant, and to her their manner was far less
haughty than to the other domestics. She occasionally came into the
drawing-room to look for things belonging to their father or mother,
so it did not excite any surprise when she advanced into the room.
They went on arranging their various articles of employment.

She wanted them to look up. She wanted them to read something in her
face--her face so full of woe, of horror. But they went on without
taking any notice. She coughed; not a natural cough; but one of those
coughs which ask so plainly for remark.

"Dear nurse, what is the matter?" asked Amy. "Are not you well?"

"Is mamma ill?" asked Sophy, quickly.

"Speak, speak, nurse!" said they all, as they saw her efforts to
articulate, choked by the convulsive rising in her throat. They
clustered round her with eager faces, catching a glimpse of some
terrible truth to be revealed.

"My dear young ladies! my dear girls," she gasped out at length, and
then she burst into tears.

"Oh! do tell us what it is, nurse," said one. "Any thing is better
than this. Speak!"

"My children! I don't know how to break it to you. My dears, poor Mr.
Harry is brought home--"

"Brought home--_brought_ home--how?" Instinctively they sank their
voices to a whisper; but a fearful whisper it was. In the same low
tone, as if afraid lest the walls, the furniture, the inanimate
things which told of preparation for life and comfort, should hear,
she answered,

"Dead!"

Amy clutched her nurse's arm, and fixed her eyes on her as if to know
if such a tale could be true; and when she read its confirmation in
those sad, mournful, unflinching eyes, she sank, without word or
sound, down in a faint upon the floor. One sister sat down on an
ottoman, and covered her face, to try and realise it. That was Sophy.
Helen threw herself on the sofa, and burying her head in the pillows,
tried to stifle the screams and moans which shook her frame.

The nurse stood silent. She had not told _all_.

"Tell me," said Sophy, looking up, and speaking in a hoarse voice,
which told of the inward pain, "tell me, nurse! Is he _dead_, did you
say? Have you sent for a doctor? Oh! send for one, send for one,"
continued she, her voice rising to shrillness, and starting to her
feet. Helen lifted herself up, and looked, with breathless waiting,
towards nurse.

"My dears, he is dead! But I have sent for a doctor. I have done all
I could."

"When did he--when did they bring him home?" asked Sophy.

"Perhaps ten minutes ago. Before you rang for Parker."

"How did he die? Where did they find him? He looked so well. He
always seemed so strong. Oh! are you sure he is dead?"

She went towards the door. Nurse laid her hand on her arm.

"Miss Sophy, I have not told you all. Can you bear to hear it?
Remember, master is in the next room, and he knows nothing yet. Come,
you must help me to tell him. Now be quiet, dear! It was no common
death he died!" She looked in her face as if trying to convey her
meaning by her eyes.

Sophy's lips moved, but nurse could hear no sound.

"He has been shot as he was coming home along Turner Street,
to-night."

Sophy went on with the motion of her lips, twitching them almost
convulsively.

"My dear, you must rouse yourself, and remember your father and
mother have yet to be told. Speak! Miss Sophy!"

But she could not; her whole face worked involuntarily. The nurse
left the room, and almost immediately brought back some sal-volatile
and water. Sophy drank it eagerly, and gave one or two deep gasps.
Then she spoke in a calm unnatural voice.

"What do you want me to do, nurse? Go to Helen and poor Amy. See,
they want help."

"Poor creatures! we must let them alone for a bit. You must go to
master; that's what I want you to do, Miss Sophy. You must break it
to him, poor old gentleman. Come, he's asleep in the dining-room, and
the men are waiting to speak to him."

Sophy went mechanically to the dining-room door.

"Oh! I cannot go in. I cannot tell him. What must I say?"

"I'll come with you, Miss Sophy. Break it to him by degrees."

"I can't, nurse. My head throbs so, I shall be sure to say the wrong
thing."

However, she opened the door. There sat her father, the shaded light
of the candle-lamp falling upon, and softening his marked features,
while his snowy hair contrasted well with the deep crimson morocco
of the chair. The newspaper he had been reading had dropped on the
carpet by his side. He breathed regularly and deeply.

At that instant the words of Mrs. Hemans's song came full into
Sophy's mind.

   "Ye know not what ye do,
     That call the slumberer back
   From the realms unseen by you,
     To life's dim, weary track."

But this life's track would be to the bereaved father something more
than dim and weary, hereafter.

"Papa," said she, softly. He did not stir.

"Papa!" she exclaimed, somewhat louder.

He started up, half awake.

"Tea is ready, is it?" and he yawned.

"No! papa, but something very dreadful--very sad, has happened!"

He was gaping so loud that he did not catch the words she uttered,
and did not see the expression of her face.

"Master Henry is not come back," said nurse. Her voice, heard in
unusual speech to him, arrested his attention, and rubbing his eyes,
he looked at the servant.

"Harry! oh no! he had to attend a meeting of the masters about these
cursed turn-outs. I don't expect him yet. What are you looking at me
so strangely for, Sophy?"

"Oh, papa, Harry is come back," said she, bursting into tears.

"What do you mean?" said he, startled into an impatient consciousness
that something was wrong. "One of you says he is not come home, and
the other says he is. Now that's nonsense! Tell me at once what's the
matter. Did he go on horseback to town? Is he thrown? Speak, child,
can't you?"

"No! he's not been thrown, papa," said Sophy, sadly.

"But he's badly hurt," put in the nurse, desirous to be drawing his
anxiety to a point.

"Hurt? Where? How? Have you sent for a doctor?" said he, hastily
rising, as if to leave the room.

"Yes, papa, we've sent for a doctor--but I'm afraid--I believe it's
of no use."

He looked at her for a moment, and in her face he read the truth. His
son, his only son, was dead.

He sank back in his chair, and hid his face in his hands, and bowed
his head upon the table. The strong mahogany dining-table shook and
rattled under his agony.

Sophy went and put her arms round his bowed neck.

"Go! you are not Harry," said he; but the action roused him.

"Where is he? where is the--" said he, with his strong face set into
the lines of anguish, by two minutes of such intense woe.

"In the servants' hall," said nurse. "Two policemen and another man
brought him home. They would be glad to speak to you when you are
able, sir."

"I am able now," replied he. At first when he stood up, he tottered.
But steadying himself, he walked, as firmly as a soldier on drill,
to the door. Then he turned back and poured out a glass of wine from
the decanter which yet remained on the table. His eye caught the
wine-glass which Harry had used but two or three hours before. He
sighed a long quivering sigh. And then mastering himself again, he
left the room.

"You had better go back to your sisters, Miss Sophy," said nurse.

Miss Carson went. She could not face death yet.

The nurse followed Mr. Carson to the servants' hall. There, on their
dinner-table, lay the poor dead body. The men who had brought it were
sitting near the fire, while several of the servants stood round the
table, gazing at the remains.

_The remains!_

One or two were crying; one or two were whispering; awed into a
strange stillness of voice and action by the presence of the dead.
When Mr. Carson came in they all drew back and looked at him with the
reverence due to sorrow.

He went forward and gazed long and fondly on the calm, dead face;
then he bent down and kissed the lips yet crimson with life. The
policemen had advanced and stood ready to be questioned. But at first
the old man's mind could only take in the idea of death; slowly,
slowly came the conception of violence, of murder. "How did he die?"
he groaned forth.

The policemen looked at each other. Then one began, and stated that
having heard the report of a gun in Turner Street, he had turned down
that way (a lonely, unfrequented way Mr. Carson knew, but a short
cut to his garden-door, of which Harry had a key); that as he (the
policeman) came nearer, he had heard footsteps as of a man running
away; but the evening was so dark (the moon not having yet risen)
that he could see no one twenty yards off. That he had even been
startled when close to the body by seeing it lying across the path at
his feet. That he had sprung his rattle; and when another policeman
came up, by the light of the lantern they had discovered who it was
that had been killed. That they believed him to be dead when they
first took him up, as he had never moved, spoken, or breathed. That
intelligence of the murder had been sent to the superintendent, who
would probably soon be here. That two or three policemen were still
about the place where the murder was committed, seeking out for some
trace of the murderer. Having said this, they stopped speaking.

Mr. Carson had listened attentively, never taking his eyes off the
dead body. When they had ended, he said,

"Where was he shot?"

They lifted up some of the thick chestnut curls, and showed a blue
spot (you could hardly call it a hole, the flesh had closed so much
over it) in the left temple. A deadly aim! And yet it was so dark a
night!

"He must have been close upon him," said one policeman.

"And have had him between him and the sky," added the other.

There was a little commotion at the door of the room, and there stood
poor Mrs. Carson, the mother.

She had heard unusual noises in the house, and had sent down her maid
(much more a companion to her than her highly-educated daughters) to
discover what was going on. But the maid either forgot, or dreaded,
to return; and with nervous impatience Mrs. Carson came down herself,
and had traced the hum and buzz of voices to the servants' hall.

Mr. Carson turned round. But he could not leave the dead for any one
living.

"Take her away, nurse. It is no sight for her. Tell Miss Sophy to go
to her mother." His eyes were again fixed on the dead face of his
son.

Presently Mrs. Carson's hysterical cries were heard all over the
house. Her husband shuddered at the outward expression of the agony
which was rending his heart.

Then the police superintendent came, and after him the doctor. The
latter went through all the forms of ascertaining death, without
uttering a word, and when at the conclusion of the operation of
opening a vein, from which no blood flowed, he shook his head, all
present understood the confirmation of their previous belief. The
superintendent asked to speak to Mr. Carson in private.

"It was just what I was going to request of you," answered he; so he
led the way into the dining-room, with the wine-glass still on the
table.

The door was carefully shut, and both sat down, each apparently
waiting for the other to begin.

At last Mr. Carson spoke.

"You probably have heard that I am a rich man."

The superintendent bowed in assent.

"Well, sir, half--nay, if necessary, the whole of my fortune I will
give to have the murderer brought to the gallows."

"Every exertion, you may be sure, sir, shall be used on our part; but
probably offering a handsome reward might accelerate the discovery
of the murderer. But what I wanted particularly to tell you, sir, is
that one of my men has already got some clue, and that another (who
accompanied me here) has within this quarter of an hour found a gun
in the field which the murderer crossed, and which he probably threw
away when pursued, as encumbering his flight. I have not the smallest
doubt of discovering the murderer."

"What do you call a handsome reward?" said Mr. Carson.

"Well, sir, three, or five hundred pounds is a munificent reward:
more than will probably be required as a temptation to any
accomplice."

"Make it a thousand," said Mr. Carson, decisively. "It's the doing of
those damned turn-outs."

"I imagine not," said the superintendent. "Some days ago the man I
was naming to you before, reported to the inspector when he came on
his beat, that he had had to separate your son from a young man, who
by his dress he believed to be employed in a foundry; that the man
had thrown Mr. Carson down, and seemed inclined to proceed to more
violence, when the policeman came up and interfered. Indeed, my man
wished to give him in charge for an assault, but Mr. Carson would not
allow that to be done."

"Just like him!--noble fellow!" murmured the father.

"But after your son had left, the man made use of some pretty strong
threats. And it's rather a curious coincidence that this scuffle took
place in the very same spot where the murder was committed; in Turner
Street."

There was some one knocking at the door of the room. It was Sophy,
who beckoned her father out, and then asked him, in an awe-struck
whisper, to come up-stairs and speak to her mother.

"She will not leave Harry, and talks so strangely.
Indeed--indeed--papa, I think she has lost her senses."

And the poor girl sobbed bitterly.

"Where is she?" asked Mr. Carson.

"In his room."

They went up stairs rapidly and silently. It was a large, comfortable
bedroom; too large to be well lighted by the flaring, flickering
kitchen-candle which had been hastily snatched up, and now stood on
the dressing-table.

On the bed, surrounded by its heavy, pall-like green curtains, lay
the dead son. They had carried him up, and laid him down, as tenderly
as though they feared to waken him; and, indeed, it looked more like
sleep than death, so very calm and full of repose was the face. You
saw, too, the chiselled beauty of the features much more perfectly
than when the brilliant colouring of life had distracted your
attention. There was a peace about him which told that death had come
too instantaneously to give any previous pain.

In a chair, at the head of the bed, sat the mother,--smiling. She
held one of the hands (rapidly stiffening, even in her warm grasp),
and gently stroked the back of it, with the endearing caress she had
used to all her children when young.

"I am glad you are come," said she, looking up at her husband, and
still smiling. "Harry is so full of fun, he always has something new
to amuse us with; and now he pretends he is asleep, and that we can't
waken him. Look! he is smiling now; he hears I have found him out.
Look!"

And, in truth, the lips, in the rest of death, did look as though
they wore a smile, and the waving light of the unsnuffed candle
almost made them seem to move.

"Look, Amy," said she to her youngest child, who knelt at her feet,
trying to soothe her, by kissing her garments.

"Oh, he was always a rogue! You remember, don't you, love? how full
of play he was as a baby; hiding his face under my arm, when you
wanted to play with him. Always a rogue, Harry!"

"We must get her away, sir," said nurse; "you know there is much to
be done before--"

"I understand, nurse," said the father, hastily interrupting her
in dread of the distinct words which would tell of the changes of
mortality.

"Come, love," said he to his wife. "I want you to come with me. I
want to speak to you down-stairs."

"I'm coming," said she, rising; "perhaps, after all, nurse, he's
really tired, and would be glad to sleep. Don't let him get cold,
though,--he feels rather chilly," continued she, after she had bent
down, and kissed the pale lips.

Her husband put his arm round her waist, and they left the room.
Then the three sisters burst into unrestrained wailings. They were
startled into the reality of life and death. And yet, in the midst of
shrieks and moans, of shivering, and chattering of teeth, Sophy's eye
caught the calm beauty of the dead; so calm amidst such violence, and
she hushed her emotion.

"Come," said she to her sisters, "nurse wants us to go; and besides,
we ought to be with mamma. Papa told the man he was talking to, when
I went for him, to wait, and she must not be left."

Meanwhile, the superintendent had taken a candle, and was examining
the engravings that hung round the dining-room. It was so common to
him to be acquainted with crime, that he was far from feeling all his
interest absorbed in the present case of violence, although he could
not help having much anxiety to detect the murderer. He was busy
looking at the only oil-painting in the room (a youth of eighteen
or so, in a fancy dress), and conjecturing its identity with the
young man so mysteriously dead, when the door opened, and Mr. Carson
returned. Stern as he had looked before leaving the room, he looked
far sterner now. His face was hardened into deep-purposed wrath.

"I beg your pardon, sir, for leaving you." The superintendent bowed.
They sat down, and spoke long together. One by one the policemen were
called in, and questioned.

All through the night there was bustle and commotion in the house.
Nobody thought of going to bed. It seemed strange to Sophy to hear
nurse summoned from her mother's side to supper, in the middle of the
night, and still stranger that she could go. The necessity of eating
and drinking seemed out of place in the house of death.

When night was passing into morning, the dining-room door opened, and
two persons' steps were heard along the hall. The superintendent was
leaving at last. Mr. Carson stood on the front door-step, feeling the
refreshment of the cooler morning air, and seeing the starlight fade
away into dawn.

"You will not forget," said he. "I trust to you."

The policeman bowed.

"Spare no money. The only purpose for which I now value wealth is
to have the murderer arrested, and brought to justice. My hope in
life now is to see him sentenced to death. Offer any rewards. Name
a thousand pounds in the placards. Come to me at any hour, night or
day, if that be required. All I ask of you is, to get the murderer
hanged. Next week, if possible--to-day is Friday. Surely, with the
clues you already possess, you can muster up evidence sufficient to
have him tried next week."

"He may easily request an adjournment of his trial, on the ground of
the shortness of the notice," said the superintendent.

"Oppose it, if possible. I will see that the first lawyers are
employed. I shall know no rest while he lives."

"Every thing shall be done, sir."

"You will arrange with the coroner. Ten o'clock, if convenient."

The superintendent took leave.

Mr. Carson stood on the step, dreading to shut out the light and air,
and return into the haunted, gloomy house.

"My son! my son!" he said, at last. "But you shall be avenged, my
poor murdered boy."

Ay! to avenge his wrongs the murderer had singled out his victim,
and with one fell action had taken away the life that God had
given. To avenge his child's death, the old man lived on; with the
single purpose in his heart of vengeance on the murderer. True, his
vengeance was sanctioned by law, but was it the less revenge?

Are we worshippers of Christ? or of Alecto?

Oh! Orestes! you would have made a very tolerable Christian of the
nineteenth century!




CHAPTER XIX.

JEM WILSON ARRESTED ON SUSPICION.


   "Deeds to be hid which were not hid,
   Which, all confused, I could not know,
   Whether I suffered or I did,
   For all seemed guilt, remorse, or woe."

   COLERIDGE.


I left Mary, on that same Thursday night which left its burden of
woe at Mr. Carson's threshold, haunted with depressing thoughts. All
through the night she tossed restlessly about, trying to get quit of
the ideas that harassed her, and longing for the light when she could
rise, and find some employment. But just as dawn began to appear, she
became more quiet, and fell into a sound heavy sleep, which lasted
till she was sure it was late in the morning by the full light that
shone in.

She dressed hastily, and heard the neighbouring church-clock strike
eight. It was far too late to do as she had planned (after inquiring
how Alice was, to return and tell Margaret), and she accordingly went
in to inform the latter of her change of purpose, and the cause of
it; but on entering the house she found Job sitting alone, looking
sad enough. She told him what she came for.

"Margaret, wench! why she's been gone to Wilson's these two hours.
Ay! sure, you did say last night you would go; but she could na rest
in her bed, so was off betimes this morning."

Mary could do nothing but feel guilty of her long morning nap, and
hasten to follow Margaret's steps; for late as it was, she felt she
could not settle well to her work, unless she learnt how kind good
Alice Wilson was going on.

So, eating her crust-of-bread breakfast, she passed rapidly along the
streets. She remembered afterwards the little groups of people she
had seen, eagerly hearing, and imparting news; but at the time her
only care was to hasten on her way, in dread of a reprimand from Miss
Simmonds.

She went into the house at Jane Wilson's, her heart at the instant
giving a strange knock, and sending the rosy flush into her face,
at the thought that Jem might possibly be inside the door. But I do
assure you, she had not thought of it before. Impatient and loving as
she was, her solicitude about Alice on that hurried morning had not
been mingled with any thought of him.

Her heart need not have leaped, her colour need not have rushed so
painfully to her cheeks, for he was not there. There was the round
table, with a cup and saucer, which had evidently been used, and
there was Jane Wilson sitting on the other side, crying quietly,
while she ate her breakfast with a sort of unconscious appetite. And
there was Mrs. Davenport washing away at a night-cap or so, which, by
their simple, old-world make, Mary knew at a glance were Alice's. But
nothing--no one else.

Alice was much the same, or rather better of the two, they told her;
at any rate she could speak, though it was sad rambling talk. Would
Mary like to see her?

Of course she would. Many are interested by seeing their friends
under the new aspect of illness; and among the poor there is no
wholesome fear of injury or excitement to restrain this wish.

So Mary went up-stairs, accompanied by Mrs. Davenport, wringing the
suds off her hands, and speaking in a loud whisper far more audible
than her usual voice.

"I mun be hastening home, but I'll come again to-night, time enough
to iron her cap; 'twould be a sin and a shame if we let her go dirty
now she's ill, when she's been so rare and clean all her life-long.
But she's sadly forsaken, poor thing! She'll not know you, Mary; she
knows none on us."

The room up-stairs held two beds, one superior in the grandeur of
four posts and checked curtains to the other, which had been occupied
by the twins in their brief life-time. The smaller had been Alice's
bed since she had lived there; but with the natural reverence to one
"stricken of God and afflicted," she had been installed since her
paralytic stroke the evening before in the larger and grander bed,
while Jane Wilson had taken her short broken rest on the little
pallet.

Margaret came forwards to meet her friend, whom she half expected,
and whose step she knew. Mrs. Davenport returned to her washing.

The two girls did not speak; the presence of Alice awed them into
silence. There she lay with the rosy colour, absent from her face
since the days of childhood, flushed once more into it by her
sickness nigh unto death. She lay on the affected side, and with
her other arm she was constantly sawing the air, not exactly in a
restless manner, but in a monotonous, incessant way, very trying to
a watcher. She was talking away, too, almost as constantly, in a low,
indistinct tone. But her face, her profiled countenance, looked calm
and smiling, even interested by the ideas that were passing through
her clouded mind.

"Listen!" said Margaret, as she stooped her head down to catch the
muttered words more distinctly.

"What will mother say? The bees are turning homeward for th' last
time, and we've a terrible long bit to go yet. See! here's a linnet's
nest in this gorse-bush. Th' hen-bird is on it. Look at her bright
eyes, she won't stir! Ay! we mun hurry home. Won't mother be pleased
with the bonny lot of heather we've got! Make haste, Sally, may be we
shall have cockles for supper. I saw th' cockle-man's donkey turn up
our way fra' Arnside."

Margaret touched Mary's hand, and the pressure in return told her
that they understood each other; that they knew how in this illness
to the old, world-weary woman, God had sent her a veiled blessing:
she was once more in the scenes of her childhood, unchanged and
bright as in those long departed days; once more with the sister of
her youth, the playmate of fifty years ago, who had for nearly as
many years slept in a grassy grave in the little church-yard beyond
Burton.

Alice's face changed; she looked sorrowful, almost penitent.

"Oh, Sally! I wish we'd told her. She thinks we were in church
all morning, and we've gone on deceiving her. If we'd told her at
first how it was--how sweet th' hawthorn smelt through the open
church-door, and how we were on th' last bench in the aisle, and
how it were the first butterfly we'd seen this spring, and how it
flew into th' very church itself; oh! mother is so gentle, I wish
we'd told her. I'll go to her next time she comes in sight, and say,
'Mother, we were naughty last Sabbath.'"

She stopped, and a few tears came stealing down the old withered
cheek, at the thought of the temptation and deceit of her childhood.
Surely, many sins could not have darkened that innocent child-like
spirit since. Mary found a red-spotted pocket-handkerchief, and put
it into the hand which sought about for something to wipe away the
trickling tears. She took it with a gentle murmur.

"Thank you, mother."

Mary pulled Margaret away from the bed.

"Don't you think she's happy, Margaret?"

"Ay! that I do, bless her. She feels no pain, and knows nought of her
present state. Oh! that I could see, Mary! I try and be patient with
her afore me, but I'd give aught I have to see her, and see what she
wants. I am so useless! I mean to stay here as long as Jane Wilson is
alone; and I would fain be here all to-night, but--"

"I'll come," said Mary, decidedly.

"Mrs. Davenport said she'd come again, but she's hard-worked all
day--"

"I'll come," repeated Mary.

"Do!" said Margaret, "and I'll be here till you come. May be, Jem and
you could take th' night between you, and Jane Wilson might get a bit
of sound sleep in his bed; for she were up and down the better part
of last night, and just when she were in a sound sleep this morning,
between two and three, Jem came home, and th' sound o' his voice
roused her in a minute."

"Where had he been till that time o' night?" asked Mary.

"Nay! it were none of my business; and, indeed, I never saw him
till he came in here to see Alice. He were in again this morning,
and seemed sadly downcast. But you'll, may be, manage to comfort
him to-night, Mary," said Margaret, smiling, while a ray of hope
glimmered in Mary's heart, and she almost felt glad, for an instant,
of the occasion which would at last bring them together. Oh! happy
night! when would it come? Many hours had yet to pass.

Then she saw Alice, and repented, with a bitter self-reproach. But
she could not help having gladness in the depths of her heart, blame
herself as she would. So she tried not to think, as she hurried along
to Miss Simmonds', with a dancing step of lightness.

She was late--that she knew she should be. Miss Simmonds was vexed
and cross. That also she had anticipated, but she had intended to
smooth her raven down by extraordinary diligence and attention. But
there was something about the girls she did not understand--had not
anticipated. They stopped talking when she came in; or rather, I
should say, stopped listening, for Sally Leadbitter was the talker to
whom they were hearkening with intense attention. At first they eyed
Mary, as if she had acquired some new interest to them, since the day
before. Then they began to whisper; and, absorbed as Mary had been in
her own thoughts, she could not help becoming aware that it was of
her they spoke.

At last Sally Leadbitter asked Mary if she had heard the news?

"No! What news?" answered she.

The girls looked at each other with gloomy mystery. Sally went on.

"Have you not heard that young Mr. Carson was murdered last night?"

Mary's lips could not utter a negative, but no one who looked at her
pale and terror-stricken face could have doubted that she had not
heard before of the fearful occurrence.

Oh, it is terrible, that sudden information, that one you have known
has met with a bloody death! You seem to shrink from the world where
such deeds can be committed, and to grow sick with the idea of the
violent and wicked men of earth. Much as Mary had learned to dread
him lately, now he was dead (and dead in such a manner) her feeling
was that of oppressive sorrow for him.

The room went round and round, and she felt as though she should
faint; but Miss Simmonds came in, bringing a waft of fresher air as
she opened the door, to refresh the body, and the certainty of a
scolding for inattention to brace the sinking mind. She, too, was
full of the morning's news.

"Have you heard any more of this horrid affair, Miss Barton?" asked
she, as she settled to her work.

Mary tried to speak; at first she could not, and when she succeeded
in uttering a sentence, it seemed as though it were not her own voice
that spoke.

"No, ma'am, I never heard of it till this minute."

"Dear! that's strange, for every one is up about it. I hope the
murderer will be found out, that I do. Such a handsome young man to
be killed as he was. I hope the wretch that did it may be hanged as
high as Haman."

One of the girls reminded them that the assizes came on next week.

"Ay," replied Miss Simmonds, "and the milk-man told me they will
catch the wretch, and have him tried and hung in less than a week.
Serve him right, whoever he is. Such a handsome young man as he was."

Then each began to communicate to Miss Simmonds the various reports
they had heard.

Suddenly she burst out--

"Miss Barton! as I live, dropping tears on that new silk gown of
Mrs. Hawkes'! Don't you know they will stain, and make it shabby for
ever? Crying like a baby, because a handsome young man meets with
an untimely end. For shame of yourself, miss. Mind your character
and your work if you please. Or, if you must cry" (seeing her
scolding rather increased the flow of Mary's tears, than otherwise),
"take this print to cry over. That won't be marked like this
beautiful silk," rubbing it, as if she loved it, with a clean
pocket-handkerchief, in order to soften the edges of the hard round
drops.

Mary took the print, and naturally enough, having had leave given her
to cry over it, rather checked the inclination to weep.

Every body was full of the one subject. The girl sent out to match
silk, came back with the account gathered at the shop, of the
coroner's inquest then sitting; the ladies who called to speak about
gowns first began about the murder, and mingled details of that, with
directions for their dresses. Mary felt as though the haunting horror
were a nightmare, a fearful dream, from which awakening would relieve
her. The picture of the murdered body, far more ghastly than the
reality, seemed to swim in the air before her eyes. Sally Leadbitter
looked and spoke of her, almost accusingly, and made no secret now of
Mary's conduct, more blameable to her fellow-workwomen for its latter
changeableness, than for its former giddy flirting.

"Poor young gentleman," said one, as Sally recounted Mary's last
interview with Mr. Carson.

"What a shame!" exclaimed another, looking indignantly at Mary.

"That's what I call regular jilting," said a third. "And he lying
cold and bloody in his coffin now!"

Mary was more thankful than she could express, when Miss Simmonds
returned, to put a stop to Sally's communications, and to check the
remarks of the girls.

She longed for the peace of Alice's sick room. No more thinking with
infinite delight of her anticipated meeting with Jem, she felt too
much shocked for that now; but longing for peace and kindness, for
the images of rest and beauty, and sinless times long ago, which the
poor old woman's rambling presented, she wished to be as near death
as Alice; and to have struggled through this world, whose sufferings
she had early learnt, and whose crimes now seemed pressing close upon
her. Old texts from the Bible that her mother used to read (or rather
spell out) aloud, in the days of childhood, came up to her memory.
"Where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest."
"The tears shall be wiped away from all eyes," &c. And it was to that
world Alice was hastening! Oh! that she were Alice!

I must return to the Wilsons' house, which was far from being the
abode of peace that Mary was picturing it to herself. You remember
the reward Mr. Carson offered for the apprehension of the murderer of
his son? It was in itself a temptation, and to aid its efficacy came
the natural sympathy for the aged parents mourning for their child,
for the young man cut off in the flower of his days; and besides
this, there is always a pleasure in unravelling a mystery, in
catching at the gossamer clue which will guide to certainty. This
feeling, I am sure, gives much impetus to the police. Their senses
are ever and always on the qui-vive, and they enjoy the collecting
and collating evidence, and the life of adventure they experience: a
continual unwinding of Jack Sheppard romances, always interesting to
the vulgar and uneducated mind, to which the outward signs and tokens
of crime are ever exciting.

There was no lack of clue or evidence at the coroner's inquest that
morning. The shot, the finding of the body, the subsequent discovery
of the gun, were rapidly deposed to; and then the policeman who had
interrupted the quarrel between Jem Wilson and the murdered young
man was brought forward, and gave his evidence, clear, simple, and
straightforward. The coroner had no hesitation, the jury had none,
but the verdict was cautiously worded. "Wilful murder against some
person unknown."

This very cautiousness, when he deemed the thing so sure as to
require no caution, irritated Mr. Carson. It did not soothe him that
the superintendent called the verdict a mere form,--exhibited a
warrant empowering him to seize the body of Jem Wilson, committed on
suspicion,--declared his intention of employing a well-known officer
in the Detective Service to ascertain the ownership of the gun, and
to collect other evidence, especially as regarded the young woman,
about whom the policeman deposed that the quarrel had taken place:
Mr. Carson was still excited and irritable; restless in body and
mind. He made every preparation for the accusation of Jem the
following morning before the magistrates: he engaged attorneys
skilled in criminal practice to watch the case and prepare briefs;
he wrote to celebrated barristers coming the Northern Circuit, to
bespeak their services. A speedy conviction, a speedy execution,
seemed to be the only things that would satisfy his craving thirst
for blood. He would have fain been policeman, magistrate, accusing
speaker, all; but most of all, the judge, rising with full sentence
of death on his lips.

That afternoon, as Jane Wilson had begun to feel the effect of
a night's disturbed rest, evinced in frequent droppings off to
sleep while she sat by her sister-in-law's bed-side, lulled by the
incessant crooning of the invalid's feeble voice, she was startled by
a man speaking in the house-place below, who, wearied of knocking at
the door, without obtaining any answer, had entered and was calling
lustily for

"Missis! missis!"

When Mrs. Wilson caught a glimpse of the intruder through the
stair-rails, she at once saw he was a stranger, a working-man, it
might be a fellow-labourer with her son, for his dress was grimy
enough for the supposition. He held a gun in his hand.

"May I make bold to ask if this gun belongs to your son?"

She first looked at the man, and then, weary and half asleep,
not seeing any reason for refusing to answer the inquiry, she
moved forward to examine it, talking while she looked for certain
old-fashioned ornaments on the stock. "It looks like his; ay, it's
his, sure enough. I could speak to it anywhere by these marks. You
see it were his grandfather's, as were gamekeeper to some one up
in th' north; and they don't make guns so smart now-a-days. But,
how comed you by it? He sets great store on it. Is he bound for th'
shooting gallery? He is not, for sure, now his aunt is so ill, and me
left all alone;" and the immediate cause for her anxiety being thus
recalled to her mind, she entered on a long story of Alice's illness,
interspersed with recollections of her husband's and her children's
deaths.

The disguised policeman listened for a minute or two, to glean any
further information he could; and then, saying he was in a hurry, he
turned to go away. She followed him to the door, still telling him
her troubles, and was never struck, until it was too late to ask the
reason, with the unaccountableness of his conduct, in carrying the
gun away with him. Then, as she heavily climbed the stairs, she put
away the wonder and the thought about his conduct, by determining
to believe he was some workman with whom her son had made some
arrangement about shooting at the gallery; or mending the old weapon;
or something or other. She had enough to fret her, without moidering
herself about old guns. Jem had given it him to bring to her; so it
was safe enough; or, if it was not, why she should be glad never to
set eyes on it again, for she could not abide fire-arms, they were so
apt to shoot people.

So, comforting herself for her want of thought in not making further
inquiry, she fell off into another doze, feverish, dream-haunted, and
unrefreshing.

Meanwhile, the policeman walked off with his prize, with an odd
mixture of feelings; a little contempt, a little disappointment, and
a good deal of pity. The contempt and the disappointment were caused
by the widow's easy admission of the gun being her son's property,
and her manner of identifying it by the ornaments. He liked an
attempt to baffle him; he was accustomed to it; it gave some exercise
to his wits and his shrewdness. There would be no fun in fox-hunting,
if Reynard yielded himself up without any effort to escape. Then,
again, his mother's milk was yet in him, policeman, officer of the
Detective Service though he was; and he felt sorry for the old woman,
whose "softness" had given such material assistance in identifying
her son as the murderer. However, he conveyed the gun, and the
intelligence he had gained, to the superintendent; and the result
was, that, in a short time afterwards, three policemen went to the
works at which Jem was foreman, and announced their errand to the
astonished overseer, who directed them to the part of the foundry
where Jem was then superintending a casting.

Dark, black were the walls, the ground, the faces around them, as
they crossed the yard. But, in the furnace-house a deep and lurid
red glared over all; the furnace roared with mighty flame. The men,
like demons, in their fire-and-soot colouring, stood swart around,
awaiting the moment when the tons of solid iron should have melted
down into fiery liquid, fit to be poured, with still, heavy sound,
into the delicate moulding of fine black sand, prepared to receive
it. The heat was intense, and the red glare grew every instant more
fierce; the policemen stood awed with the novel sight. Then, black
figures, holding strange-shaped bucket shovels, came athwart the
deep-red furnace light, and clear and brilliant flowed forth the iron
into the appropriate mould. The buzz of voices rose again; there was
time to speak, and gasp, and wipe the brows; and then, one by one,
the men dispersed to some other branch of their employment.

No. B. 72 pointed out Jem as the man he had seen engaged in a
scuffle with Mr. Carson, and then the other two stepped forward and
arrested him, stating of what he was accused, and the grounds of the
accusation. He offered no resistance, though he seemed surprised; but
calling a fellow-workman to him, he briefly requested him to tell his
mother he had got into trouble, and could not return home at present.
He did not wish her to hear more at first.

So Mrs. Wilson's sleep was next interrupted in almost an exactly
similar way to the last, like a recurring nightmare.

"Missis! missis!" some one called out from below.

Again it was a workman, but this time a blacker-looking one than
before.

"What don ye want?" said she, peevishly.

"Only nothing but--" stammered the man, a kind-hearted matter-of-fact
person, with no invention, but a great deal of sympathy.

"Well! speak out, can't ye, and ha' done with it?"

"Jem's in trouble," said he, repeating Jem's very words, as he could
think of no others.

"Trouble!" said the mother, in a high-pitched voice of distress.
"Trouble! God help me, trouble will never end, I think. What d'ye
mean by trouble? Speak out, man, can't ye? Is he ill? My boy! tell
me, is he ill?" in a hurried voice of terror.

"Na, na, that's not it. He's well enough. All he bade me say was,
'Tell mother I'm in trouble, and can't come home to-night.'"

"Not come home to-night! And what am I to do with Alice? I can't go
on, wearing my life out wi' watching. He might come and help me."

"I tell you he can't," said the man.

"Can't; and he is well, you say? Stuff! It's just that he's getten
like other young men, and wants to go a-larking. But I'll give it him
when he comes back."

The man turned to go; he durst not trust himself to speak in Jem's
justification. But she would not let him off.

She stood between him and the door, as she said, "Yo shall not go,
till yo've told me what he's after. I can see plain enough you know,
and I'll know too, before I've done."

"You'll know soon enough, missis!"

"I'll know now, I tell ye. What's up that he can't come home and help
me nurse? Me, as never got a wink o' sleep last night wi' watching."

"Well, if you will have it out," said the poor badgered man, "the
police have got hold on him."

"On my Jem!" said the enraged mother. "You're a downright liar, and
that's what you are. My Jem, as never did harm to any one in his
life. You're a liar, that's what you are."

"He's done harm enough now," said the man, angry in his turn, "for
there's good evidence he murdered young Carson, as was shot last
night."

She staggered forward to strike the man for telling the terrible
truth; but the weakness of old age, of motherly agony, overcame her,
and she sank down on a chair, and covered her face. He could not
leave her.

When next she spoke, it was in an imploring, feeble, child-like
voice.

"Oh, master, say you're only joking. I ax your pardon if I have vexed
ye, but please say you're only joking. You don't know what Jem is to
me."

She looked humbly, anxiously up at him.

"I wish I were only joking, missis; but it's true as I say. They've
taken him up on charge o' murder. It were his gun as were found
near th' place; and one o' the police heard him quarrelling with Mr.
Carson a few days back, about a girl."

"About a girl!" broke in the mother, once more indignant, though
too feeble to show it as before. "My Jem was as steady as--" she
hesitated for a comparison wherewith to finish, and then repeated,
"as steady as Lucifer, and he were an angel, you know. My Jem was not
one to quarrel about a girl."

"Ay, but it was that, though. They'd got her name quite pat. The man
had heard all they said. Mary Barton was her name, whoever she may
be."

"Mary Barton! the dirty hussey! to bring my Jem into trouble of this
kind. I'll give it her well when I see her: that I will. Oh! my poor
Jem!" rocking herself to and fro. "And what about the gun? What did
ye say about that?"

"His gun were found on th' spot where the murder were done."

"That's a lie for one, then. A man has got the gun now, safe and
sound; I saw it not an hour ago."

The man shook his head.

"Yes, he has indeed. A friend o' Jem's, as he'd lent it to."

"Did you know the chap?" asked the man, who was really anxious for
Jem's exculpation, and caught a gleam of hope from her last speech.

"No! I can't say as I did. But he were put on as a workman."

"It's may be only one of them policemen, disguised."

"Nay; they'd never go for to do that, and trick me into telling on my
own son. It would be like seething a kid in its mother's milk; and
that th' Bible forbids."

"I don't know," replied the man.

Soon afterwards he went away, feeling unable to comfort, yet
distressed at the sight of sorrow; she would fain have detained him,
but go he would. And she was alone.

She never for an instant believed Jem guilty; she would have doubted
if the sun were fire, first: but sorrow, desolation, and, at times,
anger took possession of her mind. She told the unconscious Alice,
hoping to rouse her to sympathy; and then was disappointed, because,
still smiling and calm, she murmured of her mother, and the happy
days of infancy.




CHAPTER XX.

MARY'S DREAM--AND THE AWAKENING.


   "I saw where stark and cold he lay,
     Beneath the gallows-tree,
   And every one did point and say,
     ''Twas there he died for thee!'
    *      *      *      *      *      *
   "Oh! weeping heart! Oh, bleeding heart!
     What boots thy pity now?
   Bid from his eyes that shade depart,
     That death-damp from his brow!"

   "THE BIRTLE TRAGEDY."


So there was no more peace in the house of sickness, except to Alice,
the dying Alice.

But Mary knew nothing of the afternoon's occurrences; and gladly did
she breathe in the fresh air, as she left Miss Simmonds' house, to
hasten to the Wilsons'. The very change, from the in-door to the
out-door atmosphere, seemed to alter the current of her thoughts.
She thought less of the dreadful subject which had so haunted her
all day; she cared less for the upbraiding speeches of her fellow
work-women; the old association of comfort and sympathy received from
Alice gave her the idea that, even now, her bodily presence would
soothe and compose those who were in trouble, changed, unconscious,
and absent though her spirit might be.

Then, again, she reproached herself a little for the feeling of
pleasure she experienced, in thinking that he whom she dreaded could
never more beset her path; in the security with which she could pass
each street corner--each shop, where he used to lie in ambush. Oh!
beating heart! was there no other little thought of joy lurking
within, to gladden the very air without? Was she not going to meet,
to see, to hear Jem; and could they fail at last to understand each
other's loving hearts!

She softly lifted the latch, with the privilege of friendship. _He_
was not there, but his mother was standing by the fire, stirring some
little mess or other. Never mind! he would come soon: and with an
unmixed desire to do her grateful duty to all belonging to him, she
stepped lightly forwards, unheard by the old lady, who was partly
occupied by the simmering, bubbling sound of her bit of cookery; but
more with her own sad thoughts, and wailing, half-uttered murmurings.

Mary took off bonnet and shawl with speed, and advancing, made Mrs.
Wilson conscious of her presence, by saying,

"Let me do that for you. I'm sure you mun be tired."

Mrs. Wilson slowly turned round, and her eyes gleamed like those of a
pent-up wild beast, as she recognised her visitor.

"And is it thee that dares set foot in this house, after what has
come to pass? Is it not enough to have robbed me of my boy with
thy arts and thy profligacy, but thou must come here to crow over
me--me--his mother? Dost thou know where he is, thou bad hussy, with
thy great blue eyes and yellow hair, to lead men on to ruin? Out upon
thee, with thy angel's face, thou whited sepulchre! Dost thou know
where Jem is, all through thee?"

"No!" quivered out poor Mary, scarcely conscious that she spoke, so
daunted, so terrified was she by the indignant mother's greeting.

"He's lying in th' New Bailey," slowly and distinctly spoke the
mother, watching the effect of her words, as if believing in their
infinite power to pain. "There he lies, waiting to take his trial for
murdering young Mr. Carson."

There was no answer; but such a blanched face, such wild, distended
eyes, such trembling limbs, instinctively seeking support!

"Did you know Mr. Carson as now lies dead?" continued the merciless
woman. "Folk say you did, and knew him but too well. And that for the
sake of such as you, my precious child shot yon chap. But he did not.
I know he did not. They may hang him, but his mother will speak to
his innocence with her last dying breath."

She stopped more from exhaustion than want of words. Mary spoke, but
in so changed and choked a voice that the old woman almost started.
It seemed as if some third person must be in the room, the voice was
so hoarse and strange.

"Please, say it again. I don't quite understand you. What has Jem
done? Please to tell me."

"I never said he had done it. I said, and I'll swear that he never
did do it. I don't care who heard 'em quarrel, or if it is his gun as
were found near the body. It's not my own Jem as would go for to kill
any man, choose how a girl had jilted him. My own good Jem, as was
a blessing sent upon the house where he was born." Tears came into
the mother's burning eyes as her heart recurred to the days when she
had rocked the cradle of her "first-born;" and then, rapidly passing
over events, till the full consciousness of his present situation
came upon her, and perhaps annoyed at having shown any softness of
character in the presence of the Dalilah who had lured him to his
danger, she spoke again, and in a sharper tone.

"I told him, and told him to leave off thinking on thee; but he
wouldn't be led by me. Thee! wench! thou were not good enough to wipe
the dust off his feet. A vile, flirting quean as thou art. It's well
thy mother does not know (poor body) what a good-for-nothing thou
art."

"Mother! oh mother!" said Mary, as if appealing to the merciful dead.
"But I was not good enough for him! I know I was not," added she, in
a voice of touching humility.

For through her heart went tolling the ominous, prophetic words he
had used when he had last spoken to her--

"Mary! you'll may be hear of me as a drunkard, and may be as a thief,
and may be as a murderer. Remember! when all are speaking ill of me,
yo will have no right to blame me, for it's your cruelty that will
have made me what I feel I shall become."

And she did not blame him, though she doubted not his guilt; she felt
how madly she might act if once jealous of him, and how much cause
had she not given him for jealousy, miserable guilty wretch that she
was! Speak on, desolate mother! Abuse her as you will. Her broken
spirit feels to have merited all.

But her last humble, self-abased words had touched Mrs. Wilson's
heart, sore as it was; and she looked at the snow-pale girl with
those piteous eyes, so hopeless of comfort, and she relented in spite
of herself.

"Thou seest what comes of light conduct, Mary! It's thy doing that
suspicion has lighted on him, who is as innocent as the babe unborn.
Thou'lt have much to answer for if he's hung. Thou'lt have my death
too at thy door!"

Harsh as these words seem, she spoke them in a milder tone of voice
than she had yet used. But the idea of Jem on the gallows, Jem dead,
took possession of Mary, and she covered her eyes with her wan hands,
as if indeed to shut out the fearful sight.

She murmured some words, which, though spoken low, as if choked up
from the depths of agony, Jane Wilson caught. "My heart is breaking,"
said she, feebly. "My heart is breaking."

"Nonsense!" said Mrs. Wilson. "Don't talk in that silly way. My heart
has a better right to break than yours, and yet I hold up, you see.
But, oh dear! oh dear!" with a sudden revulsion of feeling, as the
reality of the danger in which her son was placed pressed upon her.
"What am I saying? How could I hold up if thou wert gone, Jem? Though
I'm as sure as I stand here of thy innocence, if they hang thee, my
lad, I will lie down and die!"

She sobbed aloud with bitter consciousness of the fearful chance
awaiting her child. She cried more passionately still.

Mary roused herself up.

"Oh, let me stay with you, at any rate, till we know the end. Dearest
Mrs. Wilson, mayn't I stay?"

The more obstinately and upbraidingly Mrs. Wilson refused, the more
Mary pleaded, with ever the same soft, entreating cry, "Let me stay
with you." Her stunned soul seemed to bound its wishes, for the hour
at least, to remaining with one who loved and sorrowed for the same
human being that she did.

But no. Mrs. Wilson was inflexible.

"I've may be been a bit hard on you, Mary, I'll own that. But
I cannot abide you yet with me. I cannot but remember it's your
giddiness as has wrought this woe. I'll stay wi' Alice, and perhaps
Mrs. Davenport may come help a bit. I cannot put up with you about
me. Good-night. To-morrow I may look on you different, may be.
Good-night."

And Mary turned out of the house, which had been _his_ home, where
_he_ was loved, and mourned for, into the busy, desolate, crowded
street, where they were crying halfpenny broadsides, giving
an account of the bloody murder, the coroner's inquest, and a
raw-head-and-bloody-bones picture of the suspected murderer, James
Wilson.

But Mary heard not, she heeded not. She staggered on like one in a
dream. With hung head and tottering steps, she instinctively chose
the shortest cut to that home, which was to her, in her present state
of mind, only the hiding place of four walls, where she might vent
her agony, unseen and unnoticed by the keen, unkind world without,
but where no welcome, no love, no sympathising tears awaited her.

As she neared that home, within two minutes' walk of it, her
impetuous course was arrested by a light touch on her arm, and
turning hastily, she saw a little Italian boy with his humble
show-box,--a white mouse, or some such thing. The setting sun cast
its red glow on his face, otherwise the olive complexion would have
been very pale; and the glittering tear-drops hung on the long curled
eye-lashes. With his soft voice and pleading looks, he uttered, in
his pretty broken English, the words

"Hungry! so hungry."

And, as if to aid by gesture the effect of the solitary word, he
pointed to his mouth, with its white quivering lips.

Mary answered him impatiently,

"Oh, lad, hunger is nothing--nothing!"

And she rapidly passed on. But her heart upbraided her the next
minute with her unrelenting speech, and she hastily entered her door
and seized the scanty remnant of food which the cupboard contained,
and retraced her steps to the place where the little hopeless
stranger had sunk down by his mute companion in loneliness and
starvation, and was raining down tears as he spoke in some foreign
tongue, with low cries for the far distant "Mamma mia!"

With the elasticity of heart belonging to childhood he sprang up as
he saw the food the girl brought; she whose face, lovely in its woe,
had tempted him first to address her; and, with the graceful courtesy
of his country, he looked up and smiled while he kissed her hand, and
then poured forth his thanks, and shared her bounty with his little
pet companion. She stood an instant, diverted from the thought of her
own grief by the sight of his infantine gladness; and then bending
down and kissing his smooth forehead, she left him, and sought to be
alone with her agony once more.

She re-entered the house, locked the door, and tore off her bonnet,
as if greedy of every moment which took her from the full indulgence
of painful, despairing thought.

Then she threw herself on the ground, yes, on the hard flags she
threw her soft limbs down; and the comb fell out of her hair, and
those bright tresses swept the dusty floor, while she pillowed and
hid her face on her arms, and burst forth into hard, suffocating
sobs.

Oh, earth! thou didst seem but a dreary dwelling-place for thy poor
child that night. None to comfort, none to pity! And self-reproach
gnawing at her heart.

Oh, why did she ever listen to the tempter? Why did she ever give ear
to her own suggestions, and cravings after wealth and grandeur? Why
had she thought it a fine thing to have a rich lover?

She--she had deserved it all; but he was the victim,--he, the
beloved. She could not conjecture, she could not even pause to think
who had revealed, or how he had discovered her acquaintance with
Harry Carson. It was but too clear, some way or another, he had
learnt all; and what would he think of her? No hope of his love,--oh,
that she would give up, and be content; it was his life, his precious
life, that was threatened. Then she tried to recall the particulars,
which, when Mrs. Wilson had given them, had fallen but upon a
deafened ear,--something about a gun, a quarrel, which she could
not remember clearly. Oh, how terrible to think of his crime, his
blood-guiltiness; he who had hitherto been so good, so noble, and
now an assassin! And then she shrank from him in thought; and then,
with bitter remorse, clung more closely to his image with passionate
self-upbraiding. Was it not she who had led him to the pit into which
he had fallen? Was she to blame him? She to judge him? Who could
tell how maddened he might have been by jealousy; how one moment's
uncontrollable passion might have led him to become a murderer?
And she had blamed him in her heart after his last deprecating,
imploring, prophetic speech!

Then she burst out crying afresh; and when weary of crying, fell to
thinking again. The gallows! The gallows! Black it stood against
the burning light which dazzled her shut eyes, press on them as she
would. Oh! she was going mad; and for awhile she lay outwardly still,
but with the pulses careering through her head with wild vehemence.

And then came a strange forgetfulness of the present, in thought of
the long-past times;--of those days when she hid her face on her
mother's pitying, loving bosom, and heard tender words of comfort,
be her grief or her error what it might;--of those days when she had
felt as if her mother's love was too mighty not to last for ever;--of
those days when hunger had been to her (as to the little stranger
she had that evening relieved) something to be thought about, and
mourned over;--when Jem and she had played together; he, with
the condescension of an older child, and she, with unconscious
earnestness, believing that he was as much gratified with important
trifles as she was;--when her father was a cheery-hearted man, rich
in the love of his wife, and the companionship of his friend;--when
(for it still worked round to that), when mother was alive, and _he_
was not a murderer.

And then Heaven blessed her unaware, and she sank from remembering,
to wandering, unconnected thought, and thence to sleep. Yes! it was
sleep, though in that strange posture, on that hard cold bed; and she
dreamt of the happy times of long ago, and her mother came to her,
and kissed her as she lay, and once more the dead were alive again
in that happy world of dreams. All was restored to the gladness of
childhood, even to the little kitten which had been her playmate and
bosom friend then, and which had been long forgotten in her waking
hours. All the loved ones were there!

She suddenly wakened! Clear and wide awake! Some noise had startled
her from sleep. She sat up, and put her hair (still wet with tears)
back from her flushed cheeks, and listened. At first she could only
hear her beating heart. All was still without, for it was after
midnight, such hours of agony had passed away; but the moon shone
clearly in at the unshuttered window, making the room almost as light
as day, in its cold ghastly radiance. There was a low knock at the
door! A strange feeling crept over Mary's heart, as if something
spiritual were near; as if the dead, so lately present in her dreams,
were yet gliding and hovering round her, with their dim, dread forms.
And yet, why dread? Had they not loved her?--and who loved her now?
Was she not lonely enough to welcome the spirits of the dead, who had
loved her while here? If her mother had conscious being, her love for
her child endured. So she quieted her fears, and listened--listened
still.

"Mary! Mary! open the door!" as a little movement on her part seemed
to tell the being outside of her wakeful, watchful state. They
were the accents of her mother's voice; the very south-country
pronunciation, that Mary so well remembered; and which she had
sometimes tried to imitate when alone, with the fond mimicry of
affection.

So, without fear, without hesitation, she rose and unbarred the door.
There, against the moonlight, stood a form, so closely resembling her
dead mother, that Mary never doubted the identity, but exclaiming
(as if she were a terrified child, secure of safety when near the
protecting care of its parent)--

"Oh! mother! mother! You are come at last!"

She threw herself, or rather fell, into the trembling arms of her
long-lost, unrecognised aunt Esther.




CHAPTER XXI.

ESTHER'S MOTIVE IN SEEKING MARY.


   "My rest is gone,
     My heart is sore,
   Peace find I never,
     And never more."

   MARGARET'S SONG IN "FAUST."


I must go back a little to explain the motives which caused Esther to
seek an interview with her niece.

The murder had been committed early on Thursday night, and between
then and the dawn of the following day there was ample time for the
news to spread far and wide among all those whose duty, or whose
want, or whose errors, caused them to be abroad in the streets of
Manchester.

Among those who listened to the tale of violence was Esther.

A craving desire to know more took possession of her mind. Far away
as she was from Turner Street, she immediately set off to the scene
of the murder, which was faintly lighted by the gray dawn as she
reached the spot. It was so quiet and still that she could hardly
believe it to be the place. The only vestige of any scuffle or
violence was a trail on the dust, as if somebody had been lying
there, and then been raised by extraneous force. The little birds
were beginning to hop and twitter in the leafless hedge, making
the only sound that was near and distinct. She crossed into the
field where she guessed the murderer to have stood; it was easy of
access, for the worn, stunted hawthorn-hedge had many gaps in it.
The night-smell of bruised grass came up from under her feet, as she
went towards the saw-pit and carpenter's shed, which, as I have said
before, were in a corner of the field near the road, and where one of
her informants had told her it was supposed by the police that the
murderer had lurked while waiting for his victim. There was no sign,
however, that any one had been about the place. If the grass had
been bruised or bent where he had trod, it had had enough of the
elasticity of life to raise itself under the dewy influences of
night. She hushed her breath with involuntary awe, but nothing else
told of the violent deed by which a fellow-creature had passed away.
She stood still for a minute, imagining to herself the position of
the parties, guided by the only circumstance which afforded any
evidence, the trailing mark on the dust in the road.

Suddenly (it was before the sun had risen above the horizon) she
became aware of something white in the hedge. All other colours
wore the same murky hue, though the forms of objects were perfectly
distinct. What was it? It could not be a flower;--that, the time of
year made clear. A frozen lump of snow, lingering late in one of the
gnarled tufts of the hedge? She stepped forward to examine. It proved
to be a little piece of stiff writing-paper compressed into a round
shape. She understood it instantly; it was the paper that had served
as wadding for the murderer's gun. Then she had been standing just
where the murderer must have been but a few hours before; probably
(as the rumour had spread through the town, reaching her ears) one of
the poor maddened turn-outs, who hung about everywhere, with black,
fierce looks, as if contemplating some deed of violence. Her sympathy
was all with them, for she had known what they suffered; and besides
this there was her own individual dislike of Mr. Carson, and dread
of him for Mary's sake. Yet, poor Mary! Death was a terrible, though
sure, remedy for the evil Esther had dreaded for her; and how would
she stand the shock, loving as her aunt believed her to do? Poor
Mary! who would comfort her? Esther's thoughts began to picture her
sorrow, her despair, when the news of her lover's death should reach
her; and she longed to tell her there might have been a keener grief
yet had he lived.

Bright, beautiful came the slanting rays of the morning sun. It was
time for such as she to hide themselves, with the other obscene
things of night, from the glorious light of day, which was only for
the happy. So she turned her steps towards town, still holding the
paper. But in getting over the hedge it encumbered her to hold it in
her clasped hand, and she threw it down. She passed on a few steps,
her thoughts still of Mary, till the idea crossed her mind, could it
(blank as it appeared to be) give any clue to the murderer? As I said
before, her sympathies were all on that side, so she turned back and
picked it up; and then feeling as if in some measure an accessory,
she hid it unexamined in her hand, and hastily passed out of the
street at the opposite end to that by which she had entered it.

And what do you think she felt, when, having walked some distance
from the spot, she dared to open the crushed paper, and saw written
on it Mary Barton's name, and not only that, but the street in which
she lived! True, a letter or two was torn off, but, nevertheless,
there was the name clear to be recognised. And oh! what terrible
thought flashed into her mind; or was it only fancy? But it looked
very like the writing which she had once known well--the writing of
Jem Wilson, who, when she lived at her brother-in-law's, and he was a
near neighbour, had often been employed by her to write her letters
to people, to whom she was ashamed of sending her own misspelt
scrawl. She remembered the wonderful flourishes she had so much
admired in those days, while she sat by dictating, and Jem, in all
the pride of newly-acquired penmanship, used to dazzle her eyes by
extraordinary graces and twirls.

If it were his!

Oh! perhaps it was merely that her head was running so on Mary, that
she was associating every trifle with her. As if only one person
wrote in that flourishing, meandering style!

It was enough to fill her mind to think from what she might have
saved Mary by securing the paper. She would look at it just once
more, and see if some very dense and stupid policeman could have
mistaken the name, or if Mary would certainly have been dragged into
notice in the affair.

No! no one could have mistaken the "ry Barton," and it _was_ Jem's
handwriting!

Oh! if it was so, she understood it all, and she had been the cause!
With her violent and unregulated nature, rendered morbid by the
course of life she led, and her consciousness of her degradation, she
cursed herself for the interference which she believed had led to
this; for the information and the warning she had given to Jem, which
had roused him to this murderous action. How could she, the abandoned
and polluted outcast, ever have dared to hope for a blessing, even on
her efforts to do good? The black curse of Heaven rested on all her
doings, were they for good or for evil.

Poor, diseased mind! and there were none to minister to thee!

So she wandered about, too restless to take her usual heavy morning's
sleep, up and down the streets, greedily listening to every word of
the passers by, and loitering near each group of talkers, anxious
to scrape together every morsel of information, or conjecture, or
suspicion, though without possessing any definite purpose in all
this. And ever and always she clenched the scrap of paper which might
betray so much, until her nails had deeply indented the palm of her
hand; so fearful was she in her nervous dread, lest unawares she
should let it drop.

Towards the middle of the day she could no longer evade the body's
craving want of rest and refreshment; but the rest was taken in a
spirit vault, and the refreshment was a glass of gin.

Then she started up from the stupor she had taken for repose; and
suddenly driven before the gusty impulses of her mind, she pushed her
way to the place where at that very time the police were bringing
the information they had gathered with regard to the all-engrossing
murder. She listened with painful acuteness of comprehension to
dropped words and unconnected sentences, the meaning of which became
clearer, and yet more clear to her. Jem was suspected. Jem was
ascertained to be the murderer.

She saw him (although he, absorbed in deep sad thought, saw her not),
she saw him brought hand-cuffed and guarded out of the coach. She saw
him enter the station,--she gasped for breath till he came out, still
hand-cuffed, and still guarded, to be conveyed to the New Bailey.

He was the only one who had spoken to her with hope, that she might
yet win her way back to virtue. His words had lingered in her heart
with a sort of call to Heaven, like distant Sabbath bells, although
in her despair she had turned away from his voice. He was the only
one who had spoken to her kindly. The murder, shocking though it was,
was an absent, abstract thing, on which her thoughts could not, and
would not dwell; all that was present in her mind was Jem's danger,
and his kindness.

Then Mary came to remembrance. Esther wondered till she was sick of
wondering, in what way she was taking the affair. In some manner it
would be a terrible blow for the poor, motherless girl; with her
dreadful father, too, who was to Esther a sort of accusing angel.

She set off towards the court where Mary lived, to pick up what she
could there of information. But she was ashamed to enter in where
once she had been innocent, and hung about the neighbouring streets,
not daring to question, so she learnt but little; nothing in fact but
the knowledge of John Barton's absence from home.

She went up a dark entry to rest her weary limbs on a door-step and
think. Her elbows on her knees, her face hidden in her hands, she
tried to gather together and arrange her thoughts. But still every
now and then she opened her hand to see if the paper were yet there.

She got up at last. She had formed a plan, and had a course of action
to look forward to that would satisfy one craving desire at least.
The time was long gone by when there was much wisdom or consistency
in her projects.

It was getting late, and that was so much the better. She went to a
pawn-shop, and took off her finery in a back room. She was known by
the people, and had a character for honesty, so she had no very great
difficulty in inducing them to let her have a suit of outer clothes,
befitting the wife of a working-man, a black silk bonnet, a printed
gown, a plaid shawl, dirty and rather worn to be sure, but which had
a sort of sanctity to the eyes of the street-walker as being the
appropriate garb of that happy class to which she could never, never
more belong.

She looked at herself in the little glass which hung against the
wall, and sadly shaking her head, thought how easy were the duties
of that Eden of innocence from which she was shut out; how she would
work, and toil, and starve, and die, if necessary, for a husband, a
home,--for children,--but that thought she could not bear; a little
form rose up, stern in its innocence, from the witches' cauldron of
her imagination, and she rushed into action again.

You know now how she came to stand by the threshold of Mary's door,
waiting, trembling, until the latch was lifted, and her niece, with
words that spoke of such desolation among the living, fell into her
arms.

She had felt as if some holy spell would prevent her (even as the
unholy Lady Geraldine was prevented, in the abode of Christabel)
from crossing the threshold of that home of her early innocence; and
she had meant to wait for an invitation. But Mary's helpless action
did away with all reluctant feeling, and she bore or dragged her
to a seat, and looked on her bewildered eyes, as, puzzled with the
likeness, which was not identity, she gazed on her aunt's features.

In pursuance of her plan, Esther meant to assume the manners and
character, as she had done the dress, of a mechanic's wife; but then,
to account for her long absence, and her long silence towards all
that ought to have been dear to her, it was necessary that she should
put on an indifference far distant from her heart, which was loving
and yearning, in spite of all its faults. And, perhaps, she overacted
her part, for certainly Mary felt a kind of repugnance to the changed
and altered aunt, who so suddenly re-appeared on the scene; and it
would have cut Esther to the very core, could she have known how her
little darling of former days was feeling towards her.

"You don't remember me I see, Mary!" she began. "It's a long while
since I left you all, to be sure; and I, many a time, thought of
coming to see you, and--and your father. But I live so far off, and
am always so busy, I cannot do just what I wish. You recollect aunt
Esther, don't you, Mary?"

"Are you aunt Hetty?" asked Mary, faintly, still looking at the face
which was so different from the old recollections of her aunt's fresh
dazzling beauty.

"Yes! I am aunt Hetty. Oh! it's so long since I heard that name,"
sighing forth the thoughts it suggested; then recovering herself,
and striving after the hard character she wished to assume, she
continued: "And to-day I heard a friend of yours, and of mine too,
long ago, was in trouble, and I guessed you would be in sorrow, so
I thought I would just step this far and see you."

Mary's tears flowed afresh, but she had no desire to open her heart
to her strangely-found aunt, who had, by her own confession, kept
aloof from and neglected them for so many years. Yet she tried to
feel grateful for kindness (however late) from any one, and wished to
be civil. Moreover, she had a strong disinclination to speak on the
terrible subject uppermost in her mind. So, after a pause she said,

"Thank you. I dare say you mean very kind. Have you had a long walk?
I'm so sorry," said she, rising, with a sudden thought, which was as
suddenly checked by recollection, "but I've nothing to eat in the
house, and I'm sure you must be hungry, after your walk."

For Mary concluded that certainly her aunt's residence must be
far away on the other side of the town, out of sight or hearing.
But, after all, she did not think much about her; her heart was so
aching-full of other things, that all besides seemed like a dream.
She received feelings and impressions from her conversation with her
aunt, but did not, could not, put them together, or think or argue
about them.

And Esther! How scanty had been her food for days and weeks, her
thinly-covered bones and pale lips might tell, but her words should
never reveal! So, with a little unreal laugh, she replied,

"Oh! Mary, my dear! don't talk about eating. We've the best of every
thing, and plenty of it, for my husband is in good work. I'd such a
supper before I came out. I couldn't touch a morsel if you had it."

Her words shot a strange pang through Mary's heart. She had always
remembered her aunt's loving and unselfish disposition; how was it
changed, if, living in plenty, she had never thought it worth while
to ask after her relations, who were all but starving! She shut up
her heart instinctively against her aunt.

And all the time poor Esther was swallowing her sobs, and over-acting
her part, and controlling herself more than she had done for many a
long day, in order that her niece might not be shocked and revolted,
by the knowledge of what her aunt had become:--a prostitute; an
outcast.

For she longed to open her wretched, wretched heart, so hopeless, so
abandoned by all living things, to one who had loved her once; and
yet she refrained, from dread of the averted eye, the altered voice,
the internal loathing, which she feared such disclosure might create.
She would go straight to the subject of the day. She could not tarry
long, for she felt unable to support the character she had assumed
for any length of time.

They sat by the little round table, facing each other. The candle was
placed right between them, and Esther moved it in order to have a
clearer view of Mary's face, so that she might read her emotions, and
ascertain her interests. Then she began:

"It's a bad business, I'm afraid, this of Mr. Carson's murder."

Mary winced a little.

"I hear Jem Wilson is taken up for it."

Mary covered her eyes with her hands, as if to shade them from the
light, and Esther herself, less accustomed to self-command, was
getting too much agitated for calm observation of another.

"I was taking a walk near Turner Street, and I went to see the spot,"
continued Esther, "and, as luck would have it, I spied this bit of
paper in the hedge," producing the precious piece still folded in her
hand. "It has been used as wadding for the gun, I reckon; indeed,
that's clear enough, from the shape it's crammed into. I was sorry
for the murderer, whoever he might be (I didn't then know of Jem's
being suspected), and I thought I would never leave a thing about
as might help, if ever so little, to convict him; the police are so
'cute about straws. So I carried it a little way, and then I opened
it and saw your name, Mary."

Mary took her hands away from her eyes, and looked with surprise at
her aunt's face, as she uttered these words. She _was_ kind after
all, for was she not saving her from being summoned, and from being
questioned and examined; a thing to be dreaded above all others: as
she felt sure that her unwilling answers, frame them how she might,
would add to the suspicions against Jem; her aunt was indeed kind, to
think of what would spare her this.

Esther went on, without noticing Mary's look. The very action of
speaking was so painful to her, and so much interrupted by the hard,
raking little cough, which had been her constant annoyance for
months, that she was too much engrossed by the physical difficulty of
utterance, to be a very close observer.

"There could be no mistake if they had found it. Look at your name,
together with the very name of this court! And in Jem's hand-writing
too, or I'm much mistaken. Look, Mary!"

And now she did watch her.

Mary took the paper and flattened it; then suddenly stood stiff up,
with irrepressible movement, as if petrified by some horror abruptly
disclosed; her face, strung and rigid; her lips compressed tight,
to keep down some rising exclamation. She dropped on her seat, as
suddenly as if the braced muscles had in an instant given way. But
she spoke no word.

"It is his hand-writing--isn't it?" asked Esther, though Mary's
manner was almost confirmation enough.

"You will not tell. You never will tell," demanded Mary, in a tone so
sternly earnest, as almost to be threatening.

"Nay, Mary," said Esther, rather reproachfully, "I am not so bad as
that. Oh! Mary, you cannot think I would do that, whatever I may be."

The tears sprang to her eyes at the idea that she was suspected of
being one who would help to inform against an old friend.

Mary caught her sad and upbraiding look.

"No! I know you would not tell, aunt. I don't know what I say, I am
so shocked. But say you will not tell. Do."

"No, indeed I will not tell, come what may."

Mary sat still, looking at the writing, and turning the paper round
with careful examination, trying to hope, but her very fears belying
her hopes.

"I thought you cared for the young man that's murdered," observed
Esther, half aloud; but feeling that she could not mistake this
strange interest in the suspected murderer, implied by Mary's
eagerness to screen him from any thing which might strengthen
suspicion against him. She had come, desirous to know the extent of
Mary's grief for Mr. Carson, and glad of the excuse afforded her
by the important scrap of paper. Her remark about its being Jem's
hand-writing, she had, with this view of ascertaining Mary's state of
feeling, felt to be most imprudent the instant after she uttered it;
but Mary's anxiety that she should not tell was too great, and too
decided, to leave a doubt as to her interest for Jem. She grew more
and more bewildered, and her dizzy head refused to reason. Mary
never spoke. She held the bit of paper firmly, determined to retain
possession of it, come what might; and anxious, and impatient, for
her aunt to go. As she sat, her face bore a likeness to Esther's dead
child.

"You are so like my little girl, Mary!" said Esther, weary of the one
subject on which she could get no satisfaction, and recurring, with
full heart, to the thought of the dead.

Mary looked up. Her aunt had children, then. That was all the idea
she received. No faint imagination of the love and the woe of that
poor creature crossed her mind, or she would have taken her, all
guilty and erring, to her bosom, and tried to bind up the broken
heart. No! it was not to be. Her aunt had children, then; and she was
on the point of putting some question about them, but before it could
be spoken another thought turned it aside, and she went back to her
task of unravelling the mystery of the paper, and the hand-writing.
Oh! how she wished her aunt would go.

As if, according to the believers in mesmerism, the intenseness
of her wish gave her power over another, although the wish was
unexpressed, Esther felt herself unwelcome, and that her absence was
desired.

She felt this some time before she could summon up resolution to go.
She was so much disappointed in this longed-for, dreaded interview
with Mary; she had wished to impose upon her with her tale of married
respectability, and yet she had yearned and craved for sympathy in
her real lot. And she had imposed upon her well. She should perhaps
be glad of it afterwards; but her desolation of hope seemed for the
time redoubled. And she must leave the old dwelling-place, whose very
walls, and flags, dingy and sordid as they were, had a charm for her.
Must leave the abode of poverty, for the more terrible abodes of
vice. She must--she would go.

"Well, good-night, Mary. That bit of paper is safe enough with you, I
see. But you made me promise I would not tell about it, and you must
promise me to destroy it before you sleep."

"I promise," said Mary, hoarsely, but firmly. "Then you are going?"

"Yes. Not if you wish me to stay. Not if I could be of any comfort to
you, Mary;" catching at some glimmering hope.

"Oh, no," said Mary, anxious to be alone. "Your husband will be
wondering where you are. Some day you must tell me all about
yourself. I forget what your name is?"

"Fergusson," said Esther, sadly.

"Mrs. Fergusson," repeated Mary, half unconsciously. "And where did
you say you lived?"

"I never did say," muttered Esther; then aloud, "In Angel's Meadow,
145, Nicholas Street."

"145, Nicholas Street, Angel Meadow. I shall remember."

As Esther drew her shawl around her, and prepared to depart, a
thought crossed Mary's mind that she had been cold and hard in her
manner towards one, who had certainly meant to act kindly in bringing
her the paper (that dread, terrible piece of paper) and thus saving
her from--she could not rightly think how much, or how little she
was spared. So, desirous of making up for her previous indifferent
manner, she advanced to kiss her aunt before her departure.

But, to her surprise, her aunt pushed her off with a frantic kind of
gesture, and saying the words,

"Not me. You must never kiss me. You!"

She rushed into the outer darkness of the street, and there wept long
and bitterly.




CHAPTER XXII.

MARY'S EFFORTS TO PROVE AN ALIBI.


   "There was a listening fear in her regard,
   As if calamity had but begun;
   As if the vanward clouds of evil days
   Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear
   Was, with its stored thunder, labouring up."

   KEATS' "HYPERION."


No sooner was Mary alone than she fastened the door, and put the
shutters up against the window, which had all this time remained
shaded only by the curtains hastily drawn together on Esther's
entrance, and the lighting of the candle.

She did all this with the same compressed lips, and the same stony
look that her face had assumed on the first examination of the paper.
Then she sat down for an instant to think; and rising directly, went,
with a step rendered firm by inward resolution of purpose, up the
stairs;--passed her own door, two steps, into her father's room. What
did she want there?

I must tell you; I must put into words the dreadful secret which she
believed that bit of paper had revealed to her.

Her father was the murderer!

That corner of stiff, shining, thick writing-paper, she recognised as
part of the sheet on which she had copied Samuel Bamford's beautiful
lines so many months ago--copied (as you perhaps remember) on the
blank part of a valentine sent to her by Jem Wilson, in those days
when she did not treasure and hoard up every thing he had touched, as
she would do now.

That copy had been given to her father, for whom it was made, and
she had occasionally seen him reading it over, not a fortnight
ago she was sure. But she resolved to ascertain if the other part
still remained in his possession. He might, it was just possible he
_might_, have given it away to some friend; and if so, that person
was the guilty one, for she could swear to the paper anywhere.

First of all she pulled out every article from the little old chest
of drawers. Amongst them were some things which had belonged to her
mother, but she had no time now to examine and try and remember them.
All the reverence she could pay them was to carry them and lay them
on the bed carefully, while the other things were tossed impatiently
out upon the floor.

The copy of Bamford's lines was not there. Oh! perhaps he might have
given it away; but then must it not have been to Jem? It was his gun.

And she set to with redoubled vigour to examine the deal-box which
served as chair, and which had once contained her father's Sunday
clothes, in the days when he could afford to have Sunday clothes.

He had redeemed his better coat from the pawn-shop before he left,
that she had noticed. Here was his old one. What rustled under her
hand in the pocket?

The paper! "Oh! Father!"

Yes, it fitted; jagged end to jagged end, letter to letter; and even
the part which Esther had considered blank had its tallying mark with
the larger piece, its tails of _y_s and _g_s. And then, as if that
were not damning evidence enough, she felt again, and found some
bullets or shot (I don't know which you would call them) in that
same pocket, along with a small paper parcel of gunpowder. As she
was going to replace the jacket, having abstracted the paper, and
bullets, &c., she saw a woollen gun-case made of that sort of striped
horse-cloth you must have seen a thousand times appropriated to such
a purpose. The sight of it made her examine still further, but there
was nothing else that could afford any evidence, so she locked the
box, and sat down on the floor to contemplate the articles; now with
a sickening despair, now with a kind of wondering curiosity, how
her father had managed to evade observation. After all it was easy
enough. He had evidently got possession of some gun (was it really
Jem's; was he an accomplice? No! she did not believe it; he never,
never would deliberately plan a murder with another, however he might
be wrought up to it by passionate feeling at the time. Least of all
would he accuse her to her father, without previously warning her; it
was out of his nature).

Then having obtained possession of the gun, her father had loaded it
at home, and might have carried it away with him some time when the
neighbours were not noticing, and she was out, or asleep; and then he
might have hidden it somewhere to be in readiness when he should want
it. She was sure he had no such thing with him when he went away the
last time.

She felt it was of no use to conjecture his motives. His actions
had become so wild and irregular of late, that she could not reason
upon them. Besides, was it not enough to know that he was guilty of
this terrible offence? Her love for her father seemed to return with
painful force, mixed up as it was with horror at his crime. That
dear father, who was once so kind, so warm-hearted, so ready to help
either man or beast in distress, to murder! But, in the desert of
misery with which these thoughts surrounded her, the arid depths of
whose gloom she dared not venture to contemplate, a little spring of
comfort was gushing up at her feet, unnoticed at first, but soon to
give her strength and hope.

And _that_ was the necessity for exertion on her part which this
discovery enforced.

Oh! I do think that the necessity for exertion, for some kind of
action (bodily or mental) in time of distress, is a most infinite
blessing, although the first efforts at such seasons are painful.
Something to be done implies that there is yet hope of some good
thing to be accomplished, or some additional evil that may be
avoided; and by degrees the hope absorbs much of the sorrow.

It is the woes that cannot in any earthly way be escaped that admit
least earthly comforting. Of all trite, worn-out, hollow mockeries
of comfort that were ever uttered by people who will not take the
trouble of sympathising with others, the one I dislike the most
is the exhortation not to grieve over an event, "for it cannot be
helped." Do you think if I could help it, I would sit still with
folded hands, content to mourn? Do you not believe that as long as
hope remained I would be up and doing? I mourn because what has
occurred cannot be helped. The reason you give me for not grieving,
is the very and sole reason of my grief. Give me nobler and higher
reasons for enduring meekly what my Father sees fit to send, and I
will try earnestly and faithfully to be patient; but mock me not, or
any other mourner, with the speech, "Do not grieve, for it cannot be
helped. It is past remedy."

But some remedy to Mary's sorrow came with thinking. If her father
was guilty, Jem was innocent. If innocent, there was a possibility of
saving him. He must be saved. And she must do it; for was not she the
sole depository of the terrible secret? Her father was not suspected;
and never should be, if by any foresight or any exertions of her own
she could prevent it.

She did not yet know how Jem was to be saved, while her father
was also to be considered innocent. It would require much thought
and much prudence. But with the call upon her exertions, and her
various qualities of judgment and discretion, came the answering
consciousness of innate power to meet the emergency. Every step now,
nay, the employment of every minute, was of consequence; for you
must remember she had learnt at Miss Simmonds' the probability that
the murderer would be brought to trial the next week. And you must
remember, too, that never was so young a girl so friendless, or so
penniless, as Mary was at this time. But the lion accompanied Una
through the wilderness and the danger; and so will a high, resolved
purpose of right-doing ever guard and accompany the helpless.

It struck two; deep, mirk, night.

It was of no use bewildering herself with plans this weary, endless
night. Nothing could be done before morning: and, at first in her
impatience, she began to long for day; but then she felt in how unfit
a state her body was for any plan of exertion, and she resolutely
made up her mind to husband her physical strength.

First of all she must burn the tell-tale paper. The powder, bullets,
and gun-case, she tied into a bundle, and hid in the sacking of
the bed for the present, although there was no likelihood of their
affording evidence against any one. Then she carried the paper down
stairs, and burnt it on the hearth, powdering the very ashes with her
fingers, and dispersing the fragments of fluttering black films among
the cinders of the grate. Then she breathed again.

Her head ached with dizzying violence; she must get quit of the pain
or it would incapacitate her for thinking and planning. She looked
for food, but there was nothing but a little raw oatmeal in the
house: still, although it almost choked her, she ate some of this,
knowing from experience, how often headaches were caused by long
fasting. Then she sought for some water to bathe her throbbing
temples, and quench her feverish thirst. There was none in the house,
so she took the jug and went out to the pump at the other end of
the court, whose echoes resounded her light footsteps in the quiet
stillness of the night. The hard, square outlines of the houses cut
sharply against the cold bright sky, from which myriads of stars
were shining down in eternal repose. There was little sympathy in
the outward scene, with the internal trouble. All was so still, so
motionless, so hard! Very different to this lovely night in the
country in which I am now writing, where the distant horizon is soft
and undulating in the moonlight, and the nearer trees sway gently to
and fro in the night-wind with something of almost human motion; and
the rustling air makes music among their branches, as if speaking
soothingly to the weary ones who lie awake in heaviness of heart. The
sights and sounds of such a night lull pain and grief to rest.

But Mary re-entered her home after she had filled her pitcher, with
a still stronger sense of anxiety, and a still clearer conviction of
how much rested upon her unassisted and friendless self, alone with
her terrible knowledge, in the hard, cold, populous world.

She bathed her forehead, and quenched her thirst, and then, with wise
deliberation of purpose, went upstairs, and undressed herself, as if
for a long night's slumber, although so few hours intervened before
day-dawn. She believed she never could sleep, but she lay down, and
shut her eyes; and before many minutes she was in as deep and sound a
slumber as if there was no sin nor sorrow in the world.

She awakened, as it was natural, much refreshed in body; but with a
consciousness of some great impending calamity. She sat up in bed
to recollect, and when she did remember, she sank down again with
all the helplessness of despair. But it was only the weakness of an
instant; for were not the very minutes precious, for deliberation if
not for action?

Before she had finished the necessary morning business of dressing,
and setting her house in some kind of order, she had disentangled her
ravelled ideas, and arranged some kind of a plan for action. If Jem
was innocent (and now, of his guilt, even his slightest participation
in, or knowledge of, the murder, she acquitted him with all her
heart and soul), he must have been somewhere else when the crime was
committed; probably with some others, who might bear witness to the
fact, if she only knew where to find them. Every thing rested on her.
She had heard of an alibi, and believed it might mean the deliverance
she wished to accomplish; but she was not quite sure, and determined
to apply to Job, as one of the few among her acquaintance gifted with
the knowledge of hard words, for to her, all terms of law, or natural
history, were alike many-syllabled mysteries.

No time was to be lost. She went straight to Job Legh's house, and
found the old man and his grand-daughter sitting at breakfast; as she
opened the door she heard their voices speaking in a grave, hushed,
subdued tone, as if something grieved their hearts. They stopped
talking on her entrance, and then she knew they had been conversing
about the murder; about Jem's probable guilt; and (it flashed upon
her for the first time) on the new light they would have obtained
regarding herself: for until now they had never heard of her giddy
flirting with Mr. Carson; not in all her confidential talk with
Margaret had she ever spoken of him. And now Margaret would hear her
conduct talked of by all, as that of a bold, bad girl; and even if
she did not believe every thing that was said, she could hardly help
feeling wounded, and disappointed in Mary.

So it was in a timid voice that Mary wished her usual good-morrow,
and her heart sank within her a little, when Job, with a form of
civility, bade her welcome in that dwelling, where, until now, she
had been too well assured to require to be asked to sit down.

She took a chair. Margaret continued silent.

"I'm come to speak to you about this--about Jem Wilson."

"It's a bad business, I'm afeared," replied Job, sadly.

"Ay, it's bad enough anyhow. But Jem's innocent. Indeed he is; I'm as
sure as sure can be."

"How can you know, wench? Facts bear strong again him, poor fellow,
though he'd a deal to put him up, and aggravate him, they say. Ay,
poor lad, he's done for himself, I'm afeared."

"Job!" said Mary, rising from her chair in her eagerness, "you must
not say he did it. He didn't; I'm sure and certain he didn't. Oh! why
do you shake your head? Who is to believe me,--who is to think him
innocent, if you, who know'd him so well, stick to it he's guilty?"

"I'm loth enough to do it, lass," replied Job; "but I think he's
been ill used, and--jilted (that's plain truth, Mary, hard as it may
seem), and his blood has been up--many a man has done the like afore,
from like causes."

"Oh, God! Then you won't help me, Job, to prove him innocent? Oh!
Job, Job; believe me, Jem never did harm to no one."

"Not afore;--and mind, wench! I don't over-blame him for this." Job
relapsed into silence.

Mary thought a moment.

"Well, Job, you'll not refuse me this, I know. I won't mind what you
think, if you'll help me as if he was innocent. Now suppose I know--I
knew he was innocent,--it's only supposing, Job,--what must I do to
prove it? Tell me, Job! Isn't it called an _alibi_, the getting folk
to swear to where he really was at the time?"

"Best way, if you know'd him innocent, would be to find out the real
murderer. Some one did it, that's clear enough. If it wasn't Jem, who
was it?"

"How can I tell?" answered Mary, in an agony of terror, lest Job's
question was prompted by any suspicion of the truth.

But he was far enough from any such thought. Indeed, he had no doubt
in his own mind that Jem had, in some passionate moment, urged on by
slighted love and jealousy, been the murderer. And he was strongly
inclined to believe, that Mary was aware of this, only that, too
late repentant of her light conduct which had led to such fatal
consequences, she was now most anxious to save her old play-fellow,
her early friend, from the doom awaiting the shedder of blood.

"If Jem's not done it, I don't see as any on us can tell who did. We
might find out something if we'd time; but they say he's to be tried
on Tuesday. It's no use hiding it, Mary; things looks strong against
him."

"I know they do! I know they do! But, oh! Job! isn't an _alibi_ a
proving where he really was at th' time of the murder; and how must
I set about an _alibi_?"

"An _alibi_ is that, sure enough." He thought a little. "You mun ask
his mother his doings, and his whereabouts that night; the knowledge
of that will guide you a bit."

For he was anxious that on another should fall the task of
enlightening Mary on the hopelessness of the case, and he felt that
her own sense would be more convinced by inquiry and examination than
any mere assertion of his.

Margaret had sat silent and grave all this time. To tell the truth,
she was surprised and disappointed by the disclosure of Mary's
conduct, with regard to Mr. Henry Carson. Gentle, reserved, and
prudent herself, never exposed to the trial of being admired for her
personal appearance, and unsusceptible enough to be in doubt even
yet, whether the fluttering, tender, infinitely-joyous feeling she
was for the first time experiencing, at sight, or sound, or thought
of Will Wilson, was love or not,--Margaret had no sympathy with the
temptations to which loveliness, vanity, ambition, or the desire of
being admired, exposes so many; no sympathy with flirting girls, in
short. Then, she had no idea of the strength of the conflict between
will and principle in some who were differently constituted from
herself. With her, to be convinced that an action was wrong, was
tantamount to a determination not to do so again; and she had little
or no difficulty in carrying out her determination. So she could not
understand how it was that Mary had acted wrongly, and had felt too
much ashamed, in spite of all internal sophistry, to speak of her
actions. Margaret considered herself deceived; felt aggrieved; and,
at the time of which I am now telling you, was strongly inclined to
give Mary up altogether, as a girl devoid of the modest proprieties
of her sex, and capable of gross duplicity, in speaking of one
lover as she had done of Jem, while she was encouraging another in
attentions, at best of a very doubtful character.

But now Margaret was drawn into the conversation. Suddenly it flashed
across Mary's mind, that the night of the murder was the very night,
or rather the same early morning, that Margaret had been with Alice.
She turned sharp round, with--

"Oh! Margaret, you can tell me; you were there when he came back that
night; were you not? No! you were not; but you were there not many
hours after. Did not you hear where he'd been? He was away the night
before, too, when Alice was first taken; when you were there for your
tea. Oh! where was he, Margaret?"

"I don't know," she answered. "Stay! I do remember something about
his keeping Will company, in his walk to Liverpool. I can't justly
say what it was, so much happened that night."

"I'll go to his mother's," said Mary, resolutely.

They neither of them spoke, either to advise or dissuade. Mary felt
she had no sympathy from them, and braced up her soul to act without
such loving aid of friendship. She knew that their advice would be
willingly given at her demand, and that was all she really required
for Jem's sake. Still her courage failed a little as she walked to
Jane Wilson's, alone in the world with her secret.

Jane Wilson's eyes were swelled with crying; and it was sad to
see the ravages which intense anxiety and sorrow had made on her
appearance in four-and-twenty hours. All night long she and Mrs.
Davenport had crooned over their sorrows, always recurring, like the
burden of an old song, to the dreadest sorrow of all, which was now
impending over Mrs. Wilson. She had grown--I hardly know what word to
use--but, something like proud of her martyrdom; she had grown to hug
her grief; to feel an excitement in her agony of anxiety about her
boy.

"So, Mary, you're here! Oh! Mary, lass! He's to be tried on Tuesday."

She fell to sobbing, in the convulsive breath-catching manner which
tells so of much previous weeping.

"Oh! Mrs. Wilson, don't take on so! We'll get him off, you'll see.
Don't fret; they can't prove him guilty!"

"But I tell thee they will," interrupted Mrs. Wilson, half-irritated
at the light way, as she considered it, in which Mary spoke; and a
little displeased that another could hope when she had almost brought
herself to find pleasure in despair.

"It may suit thee well," continued she, "to make light o' the misery
thou hast caused; but I shall lay his death at thy door, as long as
I live, and die I know he will; and all for what he never did--no, he
never did; my own blessed boy!"

She was too weak to be angry long; her wrath sank away to feeble
sobbing and worn-out moans.

Mary was most anxious to soothe her from any violence of either grief
or anger; she did so want her to be clear in her recollection; and,
besides, her tenderness was great towards Jem's mother. So she spoke
in a low gentle tone the loving sentences, which sound so broken
and powerless in repetition, and which yet have so much power when
accompanied with caressing looks and actions, fresh from the heart;
and the old woman insensibly gave herself up to the influence of
those sweet, loving blue eyes, those tears of sympathy, those words
of love and hope, and was lulled into a less morbid state of mind.

"And now, dear Mrs. Wilson, can you remember where he said he was
going on Thursday night? He was out when Alice was taken ill; and he
did not come home till early in the morning, or, to speak true, in
the night: did he?"

"Ay! he went out near upon five; he went out with Will; he said he
were going to set [45] him a part of the way, for Will were hot upon
walking to Liverpool, and wouldn't hearken to Jem's offer of lending
him five shilling for his fare. So the two lads set off together. I
mind it all now; but, thou seest, Alice's illness, and this business
of poor Jem's, drove it out of my head; they went off together, to
walk to Liverpool; that's to say, Jem were to go a part o' th' way.
But, who knows" (falling back into the old desponding tone) "if he
really went? He might be led off on the road. Oh! Mary, wench!
they'll hang him for what he's never done."


   [Footnote 45: "To set," to accompany.]


"No, they won't--they shan't! I see my way a bit now. We mun get Will
to help; there'll be time. He can swear that Jem were with him. Where
is Jem?"

"Folk said he were taken to Kirkdale, i' th' prison-van, this
morning; without my seeing him, poor chap! Oh! wench! but they've
hurried on the business at a cruel rate."

"Ay! they've not let grass grow under their feet, in hunting out the
man that did it," said Mary, sorrowfully and bitterly. "But keep up
your heart. They got on the wrong scent when they took to suspecting
Jem. Don't be afeard. You'll see it will end right for Jem."

"I should mind it less if I could do aught," said Jane Wilson; "but
I'm such a poor weak old body, and my head's so gone, and I'm so
dazed-like, what with Alice and all, that I think and think, and can
do nought to help my child. I might ha' gone and seen him last night,
they tell me now, and then I missed it. Oh! Mary, I missed it; and I
may never see the lad again."

She looked so piteously in Mary's face with her miserable eyes, that
Mary felt her heart giving way, and, dreading the weakening of her
powers, which the burst of crying she longed for would occasion,
hastily changed the subject to Alice; and Jane, in her heart, feeling
that there was no sorrow like a mother's sorrow, replied,

"She keeps on much the same, thank you. She's happy, for she knows
nought of what's going on; but th' doctor says she grows weaker and
weaker. Thou'lt may be like to see her?"

Mary went up-stairs: partly because it is the etiquette in humble
life to offer to friends a last opportunity of seeing the dying
or the dead, while the same etiquette forbids a refusal of the
invitation; and partly because she longed to breathe, for an instant,
the atmosphere of holy calm, which seemed ever to surround the pious
good old woman. Alice lay, as before, without pain, or at least any
outward expression of it; but totally unconscious of all present
circumstances, and absorbed in recollections of the days of her
girlhood, which were vivid enough to take the place of realities to
her. Still she talked of green fields, and still she spoke to the
long-dead mother and sister, low-lying in their graves this many a
year, as if they were with her and about her, in the pleasant places
where her youth had passed.

But the voice was fainter, the motions were more languid; she was
evidently passing away; but _how_ happily!

Mary stood for a time in silence, watching and listening. Then she
bent down and reverently kissed Alice's cheek; and drawing Jane
Wilson away from the bed, as if the spirit of her who lay there were
yet cognisant of present realities, she whispered a few words of hope
to the poor mother, and kissing her over and over again in a warm,
loving manner, she bade her good-bye, went a few steps, and then once
more came back to bid her keep up her heart.

And when she had fairly left the house, Jane Wilson felt as if a
sun-beam had ceased shining into the room.

Yet oh! how sorely Mary's heart ached; for more and more the fell
certainty came on her that her father was the murderer! She struggled
hard not to dwell on this conviction; to think alone on the means of
proving Jem's innocence; that was her first duty, and that should be
done.




CHAPTER XXIII.

THE SUB-POENA.


   "And must it then depend on this poor eye
   And this unsteady hand, whether the bark,
   That bears my all of treasured hope and love,
   Shall find a passage through these frowning rocks
   To some fair port where peace and safety smile,--
   Or whether it shall blindly dash against them,
   And miserably sink? Heaven be my help;
   And clear my eye, and nerve my trembling hand!"

   "THE CONSTANT WOMAN."


Her heart beating, her head full of ideas, which required time and
solitude to be reduced into order, Mary hurried home. She was like
one who finds a jewel of which he cannot all at once ascertain the
value, but who hides his treasure until some quiet hour when he may
ponder over the capabilities its possession unfolds. She was like one
who discovers the silken clue which guides to some bower of bliss,
and secure of the power within his grasp, has to wait for a time
before he may tread the labyrinth.

But no jewel, no bower of bliss was ever so precious to miser or
lover as was the belief which now pervaded Mary's mind, that Jem's
innocence might be proved, without involving any suspicion of that
other--that dear one, so dear, although so criminal--on whose part in
this cruel business she dared not dwell even in thought. For if she
did, there arose the awful question,--if all went against Jem the
innocent, if judge and jury gave the verdict forth which had the
looming gallows in the rear, what ought she to do, possessed of her
terrible knowledge? Surely not to inculpate her father--and yet--and
yet--she almost prayed for the blessed unconsciousness of death or
madness, rather than that awful question should have to be answered
by her.

But now a way seemed opening, opening yet more clear. She was
thankful she had thought of the _alibi_, and yet more thankful to
have so easily obtained the clue to Jem's whereabouts that miserable
night. The bright light that her new hope threw over all seemed also
to make her thankful for the early time appointed for the trial. It
would be easy to catch Will Wilson on his return from the Isle of
Man, which he had planned should be on the Monday; and on the Tuesday
all would be made clear--all that she dared to wish to be made clear.

She had still to collect her thoughts and freshen her memory enough
to arrange how to meet with Will--for to the chances of a letter she
would not trust; to find out his lodgings when in Liverpool; to try
and remember the name of the ship in which he was to sail: and the
more she considered these points the more difficulty she found there
would be in ascertaining these minor but important facts. For you are
aware that Alice, whose memory was clear and strong on all points in
which her heart was interested, was lying in a manner senseless: that
Jane Wilson was (to use her own word, so expressive to a Lancashire
ear) "dazed," that is to say, bewildered, lost in the confusion of
terrifying and distressing thoughts; incapable of concentrating her
mind; and at the best of times Will's proceedings were a matter of
little importance to her (or so she pretended), she was so jealous of
aught which distracted attention from her pearl of price, her only
son Jem. So Mary felt hopeless of obtaining any intelligence of the
sailor's arrangements from her.

Then, should she apply to Jem himself? No! she knew him too well.
She felt how thoroughly he must ere now have had it in his power to
exculpate himself at another's expense. And his tacit refusal so to
do had assured her of what she had never doubted, that the murderer
was safe from any impeachment of his. But then neither would he
consent, she feared, to any steps which might tend to prove himself
innocent. At any rate, she could not consult him. He was removed to
Kirkdale, and time pressed. Already it was Saturday at noon. And even
if she could have gone to him, I believe she would not. She longed to
do all herself; to be his liberator, his deliverer; to win him life,
though she might never regain his lost love, by her own exertions.
And oh! how could she see him to discuss a subject in which both
knew who was the blood-stained man; and yet whose name might not be
breathed by either, so dearly with all his faults, his sins, was he
loved by both.

All at once, when she had ceased to try and remember, the name of
Will's ship flashed across her mind.

The _John Cropper_.

He had named it, she had been sure, all along. He had named it in his
conversation with her that last, that fatal Thursday evening. She
repeated it over and over again, through a nervous dread of again
forgetting it. The _John Cropper_.

And then, as if she were rousing herself out of some strange stupor,
she bethought her of Margaret. Who so likely as Margaret to treasure
every little particular respecting Will, now Alice was dead to all
the stirring purposes of life?

She had gone thus far in her process of thought, when a neighbour
stepped in; she with whom they had usually deposited the house-key,
when both Mary and her father were absent from home, and who
consequently took upon herself to answer all inquiries, and receive
all messages which any friends might make, or leave, on finding the
house shut up.

"Here's somewhat for you, Mary! A policeman left it."

A bit of parchment.

Many people have a dread of those mysterious pieces of parchment.
I am one. Mary was another. Her heart misgave her as she took it,
and looked at the unusual appearance of the writing, which, though
legible enough, conveyed no idea to her, or rather her mind shut
itself up against receiving any idea, which after all was rather a
proof she had some suspicion of the meaning that awaited her.

"What is it?" asked she, in a voice from which all the pith and
marrow of strength seemed extracted.

"Nay! how should I know? Policeman said he'd call again towards
evening, and see if you'd getten it. He were loth to leave it, though
I telled him who I was, and all about my keeping th' key, and taking
messages."

"What is it about?" asked Mary again, in the same hoarse, feeble
voice, and turning it over in her fingers, as if she dreaded to
inform herself of its meaning.

"Well! yo can read word of writing and I cannot, so it's queer I
should have to tell you. But my master says it's a summons for yo to
bear witness again Jem Wilson, at th' trial at Liverpool Assize."

"God pity me!" said Mary, faintly, as white as a sheet.

"Nay, wench, never take on so. What yo can say will go little way
either to help or to hinder, for folk say he's certain to be hung;
and sure enough it was t'other one as was your sweetheart."

But Mary was beyond any pang this speech would have given at another
time. Her thoughts were all busy picturing to herself the terrible
occasion of their next meeting--not as lovers meet should they meet!

"Well!" said the neighbour, seeing no use in remaining with one who
noticed her words or her presence so little; "thou'lt tell policeman
thou'st getten his precious bit of paper. He seemed to think I should
be keeping it for mysel; he's th' first as has ever misdoubted me
about giving messages, or notes. Good day."

She left the house, but Mary did not know it. She sat still with the
parchment in her hand.

All at once she started up. She would take it to Job Legh and ask him
to tell her the true meaning, for it could not be _that_.

So she went, and choked out her words of inquiry.

"It's a sub-poena," he replied, turning the parchment over with the
air of a connoisseur; for Job loved hard words, and lawyer-like
forms, and even esteemed himself slightly qualified for a lawyer,
from the smattering of knowledge he had picked up from an odd volume
of Blackstone that he had once purchased at a book-stall.

"A sub-poena--what is that?" gasped Mary, still in suspense.

Job was struck with her voice, her changed, miserable voice, and
peered at her countenance from over his spectacles.

"A sub-poena is neither more nor less than this, my dear. It's a
summonsing you to attend, and answer such questions as may be asked
of you regarding the trial of James Wilson, for the murder of Henry
Carson; that's the long and short of it, only more elegantly put, for
the benefit of them who knows how to value the gift of language. I've
been a witness before-time myself; there's nothing much to be afeared
on; if they are impudent, why, just you be impudent, and give 'em tit
for tat."

"Nothing much to be afeared on!" echoed Mary, but in such a different
tone.

"Ay, poor wench, I see how it is. It'll go hard with thee a bit, I
dare say; but keep up thy heart. Yo cannot have much to tell 'em,
that can go either one way or th' other. Nay! may be thou may do
him a bit o' good, for when they set eyes on thee, they'll see fast
enough how he came to be so led away by jealousy; for thou'rt a
pretty creature, Mary, and one look at thy face will let 'em into th'
secret of a young man's madness, and make 'em more ready to pass it
over."

"Oh! Job, and won't you ever believe me when I tell you he's
innocent? Indeed, and indeed I can prove it; he was with Will all
that night; he was, indeed, Job!"

"My wench! whose word hast thou for that?" said Job, pityingly.

"Why! his mother told me, and I'll get Will to bear witness to it.
But, oh! Job" (bursting into tears), "it is hard if you won't believe
me. How shall I clear him to strangers, when those who know him, and
ought to love him, are so set against his being innocent?"

"God knows, I'm not against his being innocent," said Job, solemnly.
"I'd give half my remaining days on earth,--I'd give them all, Mary
(and but for the love I bear to my poor blind girl, they'd be no
great gift), if I could save him. You've thought me hard, Mary, but
I'm not hard at bottom, and I'll help you if I can; that I will,
right or wrong," he added; but in a low voice, and coughed the
uncertain words away the moment afterwards.

"Oh, Job! if you will help me," exclaimed Mary, brightening up
(though it was but a wintry gleam after all), "tell me what to say,
when they question me; I shall be so gloppened, [46] I shan't know
what to answer."


   [Footnote 46: "Gloppened," terrified.]


"Thou canst do nought better than tell the truth. Truth's best at
all times, they say; and for sure it is when folk have to do with
lawyers; for they're 'cute and cunning enough to get it out sooner or
later, and it makes folk look like Tom Noddies, when truth follows
falsehood, against their will."

"But I don't know the truth; I mean--I can't say rightly what I mean;
but I'm sure, if I were pent up, and stared at by hundreds of folk,
and asked ever so simple a question, I should be for answering
it wrong; if they asked me if I had seen you on a Saturday, or a
Tuesday, or any day, I should have clean forgotten all about it, and
say the very thing I should not."

"Well, well, don't go for to get such notions into your head; they're
what they call 'narvous,' and talking on 'em does no good. Here's
Margaret! bless the wench! Look, Mary, how well she guides hersel."

Job fell to watching his grand-daughter, as with balancing, measured
steps, timed almost as if to music, she made her way across the
street.

Mary shrank as if from a cold blast--shrank from Margaret! The blind
girl, with her reserve, her silence, seemed to be a severe judge;
she, listening, would be such a check to the trusting earnestness of
confidence, which was beginning to unlock the sympathy of Job. Mary
knew herself to blame; felt her errors in every fibre of her heart;
but yet she would rather have had them spoken about, even in terms of
severest censure, than have been treated in the icy manner in which
Margaret had received her that morning.

"Here's Mary," said Job, almost as if he wished to propitiate his
grand-daughter, "come to take a bit of dinner with us, for I'll
warrant she's never thought of cooking any for herself to-day; and
she looks as wan and pale as a ghost."

It was calling out the feeling of hospitality, so strong and warm in
most of those who have little to offer, but whose heart goes eagerly
and kindly with that little. Margaret came towards Mary with a
welcoming gesture, and a kinder manner by far than she had used in
the morning.

"Nay, Mary, thou know'st thou'st getten nought at home," urged Job.

And Mary, faint and weary, and with a heart too aching-full of other
matters to be pertinacious in this, withdrew her refusal.

They ate their dinner quietly; for to all it was an effort to speak,
and after one or two attempts they had subsided into silence.

When the meal was ended Job began again on the subject they all had
at heart.

"Yon poor lad at Kirkdale will want a lawyer to see they don't put on
him, but do him justice. Hast thought of that?"

Mary had not, and felt sure his mother had not.

Margaret confirmed this last supposition.

"I've but just been there, and poor Jane is like one dateless; so
many griefs come on her at once. One time she seems to make sure
he'll be hung; and if I took her in that way, she flew out (poor
body!) and said, that in spite of what folk said, there were them as
could, and would prove him guiltless. So I never knew where to have
her. The only thing she was constant in, was declaring him innocent."

"Mother-like!" said Job.

"She meant Will, when she spoke of them that could prove him
innocent. He was with Will on Thursday night, walking a part of the
way with him to Liverpool; now the thing is to lay hold on Will and
get him to prove this." So spoke Mary, calm, from the earnestness of
her purpose.

"Don't build too much on it, my dear," said Job.

"I do build on it," replied Mary, "because I know it's the truth, and
I mean to try and prove it, come what may. Nothing you can say will
daunt me, Job, so don't you go and try. You may help, but you cannot
hinder me doing what I'm resolved on."

They respected her firmness of determination, and Job almost gave
in to her belief, when he saw how steadfastly she was acting upon
it. Oh! surest way of conversion to our faith, whatever it may
be,--regarding either small things, or great,--when it is beheld as
the actuating principle, from which we never swerve! When it is seen
that, instead of over-much profession, it is worked into the life,
and moves every action!

Mary gained courage as she instinctively felt she had made way with
one at least of her companions.

"Now I'm clear about this much," she continued, "he was with Will
when the--shot was fired (she could not bring herself to say, when
the murder was committed, when she remembered _who_ it was that, she
had every reason to believe, was the taker-away of life). Will can
prove this. I must find Will. He wasn't to sail till Tuesday. There's
time enough. He was to come back from his uncle's, in the Isle of
Man, on Monday. I must meet him in Liverpool, on that day, and tell
him what has happened, and how poor Jem is in trouble, and that he
must prove an _alibi_, come Tuesday. All this I can and will do,
though perhaps I don't clearly know how, just at present. But surely
God will help me. When I know I'm doing right, I will have no fear,
but put my trust in Him; for I'm acting for the innocent and good,
and not for my own self, who have done so wrong. I have no fear when
I think of Jem, who is so good."

She stopped, oppressed with the fulness of her heart. Margaret began
to love her again; to see in her the same sweet, faulty, impulsive,
lovable creature she had known in the former Mary Barton, but with
more of dignity, self-reliance, and purpose.

Mary spoke again.

"Now I know the name of Will's vessel--the _John Cropper_; and I
know that she is bound to America. That is something to know. But
I forget, if I ever heard, where he lodges in Liverpool. He spoke of
his landlady, as a good, trustworthy woman; but if he named her name,
it has slipped my memory. Can you help me, Margaret?"

She appealed to her friend calmly and openly, as if perfectly aware
of, and recognising the unspoken tie which bound her and Will
together; she asked her in the same manner in which she would have
asked a wife where her husband dwelt. And Margaret replied in the
like calm tone, two spots of crimson on her cheeks alone bearing
witness to any internal agitation.

"He lodges at a Mrs. Jones's, Milk-House Yard, out of Nicholas
Street. He has lodged there ever since he began to go to sea; she is
a very decent kind of woman, I believe."

"Well, Mary! I'll give you my prayers," said Job. "It's not often
I pray regular, though I often speak a word to God, when I'm either
very happy or very sorry; I've catched myself thanking Him at odd
hours when I've found a rare insect, or had a fine day for an
out; but I cannot help it, no more than I can talking to a friend.
But this time I'll pray regular for Jem, and for you. And so will
Margaret, I'll be bound. Still, wench! what think yo of a lawyer? I
know one, Mr. Cheshire, who's rather given to th' insect line--and a
good kind o' chap. He and I have swopped specimens many's the time,
when either of us had a duplicate. He'll do me a kind turn, I'm sure.
I'll just take my hat, and pay him a visit."

No sooner said, than done.

Margaret and Mary were left alone. And this seemed to bring back the
feeling of awkwardness, not to say estrangement.

But Mary, excited to an unusual pitch of courage, was the first to
break silence.

"Oh, Margaret!" said she, "I see--I feel how wrong you think I have
acted; you cannot think me worse than I think myself, now my eyes are
opened." Here her sobs came choking up her voice.

"Nay," Margaret began, "I have no right to--"

"Yes, Margaret, you have a right to judge; you cannot help it; only
in your judgment remember mercy, as the Bible says. You, who have
been always good, cannot tell how easy it is at first to go a little
wrong, and then how hard it is to go back. Oh! I little thought when
I was first pleased with Mr. Carson's speeches, how it would all end;
perhaps in the death of him I love better than life."

She burst into a passion of tears. The feelings pent up through the
day would have vent. But checking herself with a strong effort, and
looking up at Margaret as piteously as if those calm, stony eyes
could see her imploring face, she added,

"I must not cry; I must not give way; there will be time enough
for that hereafter, if--I only wanted you to speak kindly to me,
Margaret, for I am very, very wretched; more wretched than any
one can ever know; more wretched, I sometimes fancy, than I have
deserved,--but that's wrong, isn't it, Margaret? Oh! I have done
wrong, and I am punished; you cannot tell how much."

Who could resist her voice, her tones of misery, of humility? Who
would refuse the kindness for which she begged so penitently? Not
Margaret. The old friendly manner came back. With it, may be, more of
tenderness.

"Oh! Margaret, do you think he can be saved; do you think they can
find him guilty if Will comes forward as a witness? Won't that be a
good _alibi_?"

Margaret did not answer for a moment.

"Oh, speak! Margaret," said Mary, with anxious impatience.

"I know nought about law, or _alibis_," replied Margaret, meekly;
"but, Mary, as grandfather says, aren't you building too much on
what Jane Wilson has told you about his going with Will? Poor soul,
she's gone dateless, I think, with care, and watching, and over-much
trouble; and who can wonder? Or Jem may have told her he was going,
by way of a blind."

"You don't know Jem," said Mary, starting from her seat in a hurried
manner, "or you would not say so."

"I hope I may be wrong; but think, Mary, how much there is against
him. The shot was fired with his gun; he it was as threatened Mr.
Carson not many days before; he was absent from home at that very
time, as we know, and, as I'm much afeared, some one will be called
on to prove; and there's no one else to share suspicion with him."

Mary heaved a deep sigh.

"But, Margaret, he did not do it," Mary again asserted.

Margaret looked unconvinced.

"I can do no good, I see, by saying so, for none on you believe me,
and I won't say so again till I can prove it. Monday morning I'll go
to Liverpool. I shall be at hand for the trial. Oh dear! dear! And I
will find Will; and then, Margaret, I think you'll be sorry for being
so stubborn about Jem."

"Don't fly off, dear Mary; I'd give a deal to be wrong. And now I'm
going to be plain spoken. You'll want money. Them lawyers is no
better than a spunge for sucking up money; let alone your hunting out
Will, and your keep in Liverpool, and what not. You must take some of
the mint I've got laid by in the old tea-pot. You have no right to
refuse, for I offer it to Jem, not to you; it's for his purposes
you're to use it."

"I know--I see. Thank you, Margaret; you're a kind one, at any
rate. I take it for Jem; and I'll do my very best with it for him.
Not all, though; don't think I'll take all. They'll pay me for my
keep. I'll take this," accepting a sovereign from the hoard which
Margaret produced out of its accustomed place in the cupboard. "Your
grandfather will pay the lawyer. I'll have nought to do with him,"
shuddering as she remembered Job's words, about lawyers' skill in
always discovering the truth, sooner or later; and knowing what was
the secret she had to hide.

"Bless you! don't make such ado about it," said Margaret, cutting
short Mary's thanks. "I sometimes think there's two sides to the
commandment; and that we may say, 'Let others do unto you, as you
would do unto them,' for pride often prevents our giving others a
great deal of pleasure, in not letting them be kind, when their
hearts are longing to help; and when we ourselves should wish to do
just the same, if we were in their place. Oh! how often I've been
hurt, by being coldly told by persons not to trouble myself about
their care, or sorrow, when I saw them in great grief, and wanted to
be of comfort. Our Lord Jesus was not above letting folk minister to
Him, for He knew how happy it makes one to do aught for another. It's
the happiest work on earth."

Mary had been too much engrossed by watching what was passing in the
street to attend very closely to that which Margaret was saying. From
her seat she could see out of the window pretty plainly, and she
caught sight of a gentleman walking alongside of Job, evidently in
earnest conversation with him, and looking keen and penetrating
enough to be a lawyer. Job was laying down something to be attended
to she could see, by his up-lifted fore-finger, and his whole
gesture; then he pointed and nodded across the street to his own
house, as if inducing his companion to come in. Mary dreaded lest he
should, and she be subjected to a closer cross-examination than she
had hitherto undergone, as to why she was so certain that Jem was
innocent. She feared he was coming; he stepped a little towards the
spot. No! it was only to make way for a child, tottering along, whom
Mary had overlooked. Now Job took him by the button, so earnestly
familiar had he grown. The gentleman looked "fidging fain" to be
gone, but submitted in a manner that made Mary like him in spite
of his profession. Then came a volley of last words, answered by
briefest nods, and monosyllables; and then the stranger went off with
redoubled quickness of pace, and Job crossed the street with a little
satisfied air of importance on his kindly face.

"Well! Mary," said he on entering, "I've seen the lawyer, not Mr.
Cheshire though; trials for murder, it seems, are not his line o'
business. But he gived me a note to another 'torney; a fine fellow
enough, only too much of a talker; I could hardly get a word in, he
cut me so short. However, I've just been going over the principal
points again to him; may be you saw us? I wanted him just to come
over and speak to you himsel, Mary, but he was pressed for time; and
he said your evidence would not be much either here or there. He's
going to the 'sizes first train on Monday morning, and will see Jem,
and hear the ins and outs from him, and he's gived me his address,
Mary, and you and Will are to call on him (Will 'special) on Monday
at two o'clock. Thou'rt taking it in, Mary; thou'rt to call on him in
Liverpool at two, Monday afternoon?"

Job had reason to doubt if she fully understood him; for all this
minuteness of detail, these satisfactory arrangements, as he
considered them, only seemed to bring the circumstances in which she
was placed more vividly home to Mary. They convinced her that it was
real, and not all a dream, as she had sunk into fancying it for a
few minutes, while sitting in the old accustomed place, her body
enjoying the rest, and her frame sustained by food, and listening to
Margaret's calm voice. The gentleman she had just beheld would see
and question Jem in a few hours, and what would be the result?

Monday: that was the day after to-morrow, and on Tuesday, life and
death would be tremendous realities to her lover; or else death would
be an awful certainty to her father.

No wonder Job went over his main points again:--

"Monday; at two o'clock, mind; and here's his card. 'Mr. Bridgenorth,
41, Renshaw Street, Liverpool.' He'll be lodging there."

Job ceased talking, and the silence roused Mary up to thank him.

"You're very kind, Job; very. You and Margaret won't desert me, come
what will."

"Pooh! pooh! wench; don't lose heart, just as I'm beginning to get
it. He seems to think a deal on Will's evidence. You're sure, girls,
you're under no mistake about Will?"

"I'm sure," said Mary, "he went straight from here, purposing to go
see his uncle at the Isle of Man, and be back Sunday night, ready for
the ship sailing on Tuesday."

"So am I," said Margaret. "And the ship's name was the _John
Cropper_, and he lodged where I told Mary before. Have you got it
down, Mary?" Mary wrote it on the back of Mr. Bridgenorth's card.

"He was not over-willing to go," said she, as she wrote, "for he knew
little about his uncle, and said he didn't care if he never knowed
more. But he said kinsfolk was kinsfolk, and promises was promises,
so he'd go for a day or so, and then it would be over."

Margaret had to go and practise some singing in town; so, though loth
to depart and be alone, Mary bade her friends good-bye.




CHAPTER XXIV.

WITH THE DYING.


   "O sad and solemn is the trembling watch
   Of those who sit and count the heavy hours,
   Beside the fevered sleep of one they love!
   O awful is it in the hushed mid night,
   While gazing on the pallid, moveless form,
   To start and ask, 'Is it now sleep--or death?'"

   ANONYMOUS.


Mary could not be patient in her loneliness; so much painful thought
weighed on her mind; the very house was haunted with memories and
foreshadowings.

Having performed all duties to Jem, as far as her weak powers,
yet loving heart could act; and a black veil being drawn over her
father's past, present, and future life, beyond which she could not
penetrate to judge of any filial service she ought to render; her
mind unconsciously sought after some course of action in which
she might engage. Any thing, any thing, rather than leisure for
reflection.

And then came up the old feeling which first bound Ruth to Naomi; the
love they both held towards one object; and Mary felt that her cares
would be most lightened by being of use, or of comfort to his mother.
So she once more locked up the house, and set off towards Ancoats;
rushing along with down-cast head, for fear lest any one should
recognise her and arrest her progress.

Jane Wilson sat quietly in her chair as Mary entered; so quietly, as
to strike one by the contrast it presented to her usual bustling and
nervous manner.

She looked very pale and wan; but the quietness was the thing that
struck Mary most. She did not rise as Mary came in, but sat still and
said something in so gentle, so feeble a voice, that Mary did not
catch it.

Mrs. Davenport, who was there, plucked Mary by the gown, and
whispered,

"Never heed her; she's worn out, and best let alone. I'll tell you
all about it, up-stairs."

But Mary, touched by the anxious look with which Mrs. Wilson gazed
at her, as if awaiting the answer to some question, went forward to
listen to the speech she was again repeating.

"What is this? will you tell me?"

Then Mary looked and saw another ominous slip of parchment in the
mother's hand, which she was rolling up and down in a tremulous
manner between her fingers.

Mary's heart sickened within her, and she could not speak.

"What is it?" she repeated. "Will you tell me?" She still looked at
Mary, with the same child-like gaze of wonder and patient entreaty.

What could she answer?

"I telled ye not to heed her," said Mrs. Davenport, a little angrily.
"She knows well enough what it is,--too well, belike. I was not
in when they sarved it; but Mrs. Heming (her as lives next door)
was, and she spelled out the meaning, and made it all clear to Mrs.
Wilson. It's a summons to be a witness on Jem's trial--Mrs. Heming
thinks, to swear to the gun; for, yo see, there's nobbut [47] her
as can testify to its being his, and she let on so easily to the
policeman that it was his, that there's no getting off her word now.
Poor body; she takes it very hard, I dare say!"


   [Footnote 47: "Nobbut," none-but.
                 "No man sigh evere God _no but_ the oon bigetun
                 sone."--_Wiclif's Version._]


Mrs. Wilson had waited patiently while this whispered speech was
being uttered, imagining, perhaps, that it would end in some
explanation addressed to her. But when both were silent, though
their eyes, without speech or language, told their hearts' pity, she
spoke again in the same unaltered gentle voice (so different from
the irritable impatience she had been ever apt to show to every
one except her husband,--he who had wedded her, broken-down and
injured)--in a voice so different, I say, from the old, hasty manner,
she spoke now the same anxious words,

"What is this? Will you tell me?"

"Yo'd better give it me at once, Mrs. Wilson, and let me put it out
of your sight.--Speak to her, Mary, wench, and ask for a sight on it;
I've tried, and better-tried to get it from her, and she takes no
heed of words, and I'm loth to pull it by force out of her hands."

Mary drew the little "cricket" [48] out from under the dresser, and
sat down at Mrs. Wilson's knee, and, coaxing one of her tremulous,
ever-moving hands into hers, began to rub it soothingly; there was a
little resistance--a very little, but that was all; and presently, in
the nervous movement of the imprisoned hand, the parchment fell to
the ground.


   [Footnote 48 "Cricket," a stool.]


Mary calmly and openly picked it up without any attempt at
concealment, and quietly placing it in sight of the anxious eyes
that followed it with a kind of spell-bound dread, went on with her
soothing caresses.

"She has had no sleep for many nights," said the girl to Mrs.
Davenport, "and all this woe and sorrow,--it's no wonder."

"No, indeed!" Mrs. Davenport answered.

"We must get her fairly to bed; we must get her undressed, and all;
and trust to God, in His mercy, to send her to sleep, or else,--"

For, you see, they spoke before her as if she were not there; her
heart was so far away.

Accordingly they almost lifted her from the chair in which she sat
motionless, and taking her up as gently as a mother carries her
sleeping baby, they undressed her poor, worn form, and laid her in
the little bed up-stairs. They had once thought of placing her in
Jem's bed, to be out of sight or sound of any disturbance of Alice's,
but then again they remembered the shock she might receive in
awakening in so unusual a place, and also that Mary, who intended
to keep vigil that night in the house of mourning, would find it
difficult to divide her attention in the possible cases that might
ensue.

So they laid her, as I said before, on that little pallet-bed; and,
as they were slowly withdrawing from the bed-side, hoping and praying
that she might sleep, and forget for a time her heavy burden, she
looked wistfully after Mary, and whispered,

"You haven't told me what it is. What is it?"

And gazing in her face for the expected answer, her eye-lids slowly
closed, and she fell into a deep, heavy sleep, almost as profound a
rest as death.

Mrs. Davenport went her way, and Mary was alone,--for I cannot call
those who sleep allies against the agony of thought which solitude
sometimes brings up.

She dreaded the night before her. Alice might die; the doctor had
that day declared her case hopeless, and not far from death; and
at times the terror, so natural to the young, not of death, but of
the remains of the dead, came over Mary; and she bent and listened
anxiously for the long-drawn, pausing breath of the sleeping Alice.

Or Mrs. Wilson might awake in a state which Mary dreaded to
anticipate, and anticipated while she dreaded;--in a state of
complete delirium. Already her senses had been severely stunned by
the full explanation of what was required of her,--of what she had
to prove against her son, her Jem, her only child,--which Mary could
not doubt the officious Mrs. Heming had given; and what if in dreams
(that land into which no sympathy or love can penetrate with another,
either to share its bliss or its agony,--that land whose scenes are
unspeakable terrors, are hidden mysteries, are priceless treasures to
one alone,--that land where alone I may see, while yet I tarry here,
the sweet looks of my dead child),--what if, in the horrors of her
dreams, her brain should go still more astray, and she should waken
crazy with her visions, and the terrible reality that begot them?

How much worse is anticipation sometimes than reality! How Mary
dreaded that night, and how calmly it passed by! Even more so than if
Mary had not had such claims upon her care!

Anxiety about them deadened her own peculiar anxieties. She thought
of the sleepers whom she was watching, till overpowered herself by
the want of rest, she fell off into short slumbers in which the night
wore imperceptibly away. To be sure Alice spoke, and sang, during her
waking moments, like the child she deemed herself; but so happily
with the dearly-loved ones around her, with the scent of the heather,
and the song of the wild bird hovering about her in imagination--with
old scraps of ballads, or old snatches of primitive versions of the
Psalms (such as are sung in country churches half draperied over with
ivy, and where the running brook, or the murmuring wind among the
trees makes fit accompaniment to the chorus of human voices uttering
praise and thanksgiving to their God)--that the speech and the song
gave comfort and good cheer to the listener's heart, and the gray
dawn began to dim the light of the rush-candle, before Mary thought
it possible that day was already trembling on the horizon.

Then she got up from the chair where she had been dozing, and went,
half-asleep, to the window to assure herself that morning was at
hand. The streets were unusually quiet with a Sabbath stillness. No
factory bells that morning; no early workmen going to their labours;
no slip-shod girls cleaning the windows of the little shops which
broke the monotony of the street; instead, you might see here and
there some operative sallying forth for a breath of country air, or
some father leading out his wee toddling bairns for the unwonted
pleasure of a walk with "Daddy," in the clear frosty morning. Men
with more leisure on week-days would perhaps have walked quicker than
they did through the fresh sharp air of this Sunday morning; but to
them there was a pleasure, an absolute refreshment in the dawdling
gait they, one and all of them, had.

To be sure, there were one or two passengers on that morning whose
objects were less innocent and less praiseworthy than those of the
people I have already mentioned, and whose animal state of mind and
body clashed jarringly on the peacefulness of the day; but upon them
I will not dwell: as you and I, and almost every one, I think, may
send up our individual cry of self-reproach that we have not done all
that we could for the stray and wandering ones of our brethren.

When Mary turned from the window, she went to the bed of each
sleeper, to look and listen. Alice looked perfectly quiet and happy
in her slumber, and her face seemed to have become much more youthful
during her painless approach to death.

Mrs. Wilson's countenance was stamped with the anxiety of the last
few days, although she, too, appeared sleeping soundly; but as Mary
gazed on her, trying to trace a likeness to her son in her face,
she awoke and looked up into Mary's eyes, while the expression of
consciousness came back into her own.

Both were silent for a minute or two. Mary's eyes had fallen beneath
that penetrating gaze, in which the agony of memory seemed every
moment to find fuller vent.

"Is it a dream?" the mother asked at last in a low voice.

"No!" replied Mary, in the same tone.

Mrs. Wilson hid her face in the pillow.

She was fully conscious of every thing this morning; it was evident
that the stunning effect of the subpoena, which had affected her so
much last night in her weak, worn-out state, had passed away. Mary
offered no opposition when she indicated by languid gesture and
action that she wished to rise. A sleepless bed is a haunted place.

When she was dressed with Mary's help, she stood by Alice for a
minute or two, looking at the slumberer.

"How happy she is!" said she, quietly and sadly.

All the time that Mary was getting breakfast ready, and performing
every other little domestic office she could think of, to add to
the comfort of Jem's mother, Mrs. Wilson sat still in the arm-chair,
watching her silently. Her old irritation of temper and manner seemed
to have suddenly disappeared, or perhaps she was too depressed in
body and mind to show it.

Mary told her all that had been done with regard to Mr. Bridgenorth;
all her own plans for seeking out Will; all her hopes; and concealed
as well as she could all the doubts and fears that would arise
unbidden. To this Mrs. Wilson listened without much remark, but with
deep interest and perfect comprehension. When Mary ceased she sighed
and said, "Oh wench! I am his mother, and yet I do so little, I can
do so little! That's what frets me! I seem like a child as sees its
mammy ill, and moans and cries its little heart out, yet does nought
to help. I think my sense has left me all at once, and I can't even
find strength to cry like the little child."

Hereupon she broke into a feeble wail of self-reproach, that her
outward show of misery was not greater; as if any cries, or tears, or
loud-spoken words could have told of such pangs at the heart as that
look, and that thin, piping, altered voice!

But think of Mary and what she was enduring! Picture to yourself (for
I cannot tell you) the armies of thoughts that met and clashed in her
brain; and then imagine the effort it cost her to be calm, and quiet,
and even, in a faint way, cheerful and smiling at times.

After a while she began to stir about in her own mind for some means
of sparing the poor mother the trial of appearing as a witness in
the matter of the gun. She had made no allusion to her summons this
morning, and Mary almost thought she must have forgotten it; and
surely some means might be found to prevent that additional sorrow.
She must see Job about it; nay, if necessary, she must see Mr.
Bridgenorth, with all his truth-compelling powers; for, indeed, she
had so struggled and triumphed (though a sadly-bleeding victor at
heart) over herself these two last days, had so concealed agony,
and hidden her inward woe and bewilderment, that she began to take
confidence, and to have faith in her own powers of meeting any one
with a passably fair show, whatever might be rending her life beneath
the cloak of her deception.

Accordingly, as soon as Mrs. Davenport came in after morning church,
to ask after the two lone women, and she had heard the report Mary
had to give (so much better as regarded Mrs. Wilson than what they
had feared the night before it would have been)--as soon as this
kind-hearted, grateful woman came in, Mary, telling her her purpose,
went off to fetch the doctor who attended Alice.

He was shaking himself after his morning's round, and happy in the
anticipation of his Sunday's dinner; but he was a good-tempered man,
who found it difficult to keep down his jovial easiness even by the
bed of sickness or death. He had mischosen his profession; for it was
his delight to see every one around him in full enjoyment of life.

However, he subdued his face to the proper expression of sympathy,
befitting a doctor listening to a patient, or a patient's friend (and
Mary's sad, pale, anxious face might be taken for either the one or
the other).

"Well, my girl! and what brings you here?" said he, as he entered his
surgery. "Not on your own account, I hope."

"I wanted you to come and see Alice Wilson,--and then I thought you
would may be take a look at Mrs. Wilson."

He bustled on his hat and coat, and followed Mary instantly.

After shaking his head over Alice (as if it was a mournful thing for
one so pure and good, so true, although so humble a Christian, to
be nearing her desired haven), and muttering the accustomed words
intended to destroy hope, and prepare anticipation, he went in
compliance with Mary's look to ask the usual questions of Mrs.
Wilson, who sat passively in her arm-chair.

She answered his questions, and submitted to his examination.

"How do you think her?" asked Mary, eagerly.

"Why--a," began he, perceiving that he was desired to take one side
in his answer, and unable to find out whether his listener was
anxious for a favourable verdict or otherwise; but thinking it most
probable that she would desire the former, he continued,

"She is weak, certainly; the natural result of such a shock as the
arrest of her son would be,--for I understand this James Wilson, who
murdered Mr. Carson, was her son. Sad thing to have such a reprobate
in the family."

"You say '_who murdered_,' sir!" said Mary, indignantly. "He is only
taken up on suspicion, and many have no doubt of his innocence--those
who know him, sir."

"Ah, well, well! doctors have seldom time to read newspapers, and I
dare say I'm not very correct in my story. I dare say he's innocent;
I'm sure I had no right to say otherwise,--only words slip out.--No!
indeed, young woman, I see no cause for apprehension about this poor
creature in the next room;--weak--certainly; but a day or two's good
nursing will set her up, and I'm sure you're a good nurse, my dear,
from your pretty, kind-hearted face,--I'll send a couple of pills and
a draught, but don't alarm yourself,--there's no occasion, I assure
you."

"But you don't think her fit to go to Liverpool?" asked Mary, still
in the anxious tone of one who wishes earnestly for some particular
decision.

"To Liverpool--yes," replied he. "A short journey like that could
not fatigue, and might distract her thoughts. Let her go by all
means,--it would be the very thing for her."

"Oh, sir!" burst out Mary, almost sobbing; "I did so hope you would
say she was too ill to go."

"Whew--" said he, with a prolonged whistle, trying to understand the
case, but being, as he said, no reader of newspapers, utterly unaware
of the peculiar reasons there might be for so apparently unfeeling
a wish,--"Why did you not tell me so sooner? It might certainly do
her harm in her weak state; there is always some risk attending
journeys--draughts, and what not. To her, they might prove very
injurious,--very. I disapprove of journeys, or excitement, in all
cases where the patient is in the low, fluttered state in which Mrs.
Wilson is. If you take _my_ advice, you will certainly put a stop to
all thoughts of going to Liverpool." He really had completely changed
his opinion, though quite unconsciously; so desirous was he to comply
with the wishes of others.

"Oh, sir, thank you! And will you give me a certificate of her being
unable to go, if the lawyer says we must have one? The lawyer, you
know," continued she, seeing him look puzzled, "who is to defend
Jem,--it was as a witness against him--"

"My dear girl!" said he, almost angrily, "why did you not state the
case fully at first? one minute would have done it,--and my dinner
waiting all this time. To be sure she can't go,--it would be madness
to think of it; if her evidence could have done good, it would have
been a different thing. Come to me for the certificate any time;
that is to say, if the lawyer advises you. I second the lawyer; take
counsel with both the learned professions--ha, ha, ha,--"

And laughing at his own joke, he departed, leaving Mary accusing
herself of stupidity in having imagined that every one was as well
acquainted with the facts concerning the trial as she was herself;
for indeed she had never doubted that the doctor would have been
aware of the purpose of poor Mrs. Wilson's journey to Liverpool.

Presently she went to Job (the ever-ready Mrs. Davenport keeping
watch over the two old women), and told him her fears, her plans, and
her proceedings.

To her surprise he shook his head doubtfully.

"It may have an awkward look, if we keep her back. Lawyers is up to
tricks."

"But it's no trick," said Mary. "She is so poorly, she was last
night, at least; and to-day she's so faded and weak."

"Poor soul! I dare say. I only mean for Jem's sake; as so much is
known, it won't do now to hang back. But I'll ask Mr. Bridgenorth.
I'll e'en take your doctor's advice. Yo tarry at home, and I'll come
to yo in an hour's time. Go thy ways, wench."




CHAPTER XXV.

MRS. WILSON'S DETERMINATION.


   "Something there was, what, none presumed to say,
   Clouds lightly passing on a smiling day,--
   Whispers and hints which went from ear to ear,
   And mixed reports no judge on earth could clear."

   CRABBE.

   "Curious conjectures he may always make,
   And either side of dubious questions take."

   IB.


Mary went home. Oh! how her head did ache, and how dizzy her brain
was growing! But there would be time enough she felt for giving way,
hereafter.

So she sat quiet and still by an effort; sitting near the window, and
looking out of it, but seeing nothing, when all at once she caught
sight of something which roused her up, and made her draw back.

But it was too late. She had been seen.

Sally Leadbitter flaunted into the little dingy room, making it gaudy
with the Sunday excess of colouring in her dress.

She was really curious to see Mary; her connexion with a murderer
seemed to have made her into a sort of _lusus naturæ_, and was
almost, by some, expected to have made a change in her personal
appearance, so earnestly did they stare at her. But Mary had been too
much absorbed this last day or two to notice this.

Now Sally had a grand view, and looked her over and over (a very
different thing from looking her through and through), and almost
learnt her off by heart;--"her every-day gown (Hoyle's print you
know, that lilac thing with the high body) she was so fond of; a
little black silk handkerchief just knotted round her neck, like a
boy; her hair all taken back from her face, as if she wanted to keep
her head cool--she would always keep that hair of hers so long; and
her hands twitching continually about."

Such particulars would make Sally into a Gazette Extraordinary the
next morning at the work-room, and were worth coming for, even if
little else could be extracted from Mary.

"Why, Mary!" she began. "Where have you hidden yourself? You never
showed your face all yesterday at Miss Simmonds'. You don't fancy
we think any the worse of you for what's come and gone. Some on us,
indeed, were a bit sorry for the poor young man, as lies stiff and
cold for your sake, Mary; but we shall ne'er cast it up against you.
Miss Simmonds, too, will be mighty put out if you don't come, for
there's a deal of mourning, agait."

"I can't," Mary said, in a low voice. "I don't mean ever to come
again."

"Why, Mary!" said Sally, in unfeigned surprise. "To be sure you'll
have to be in Liverpool, Tuesday, and may be Wednesday; but after
that you'll surely come, and tell us all about it. Miss Simmonds
knows you'll have to be off those two days. But between you and me,
she's a bit of a gossip, and will like hearing all how and about the
trial, well enough to let you off very easy for your being absent a
day or two. Besides, Betsy Morgan was saying yesterday, she shouldn't
wonder but you'd prove quite an attraction to customers. Many a one
would come and have their gowns made by Miss Simmonds just to catch a
glimpse at you, at after the trial's over. Really, Mary, you'll turn
out quite a heroine."

The little fingers twitched worse than ever; the large soft eyes
looked up pleadingly into Sally's face; but she went on in the same
strain, not from any unkind or cruel feeling towards Mary, but solely
because she was incapable of comprehending her suffering.

She had been shocked, of course, at Mr. Carson's death, though at
the same time the excitement was rather pleasant than otherwise; and
dearly now would she have enjoyed the conspicuous notice which Mary
was sure to receive.

"How shall you like being cross-examined, Mary?"

"Not at all," answered Mary, when she found she must answer.

"La! what impudent fellows those lawyers are! And their clerks, too,
not a bit better. I shouldn't wonder" (in a comforting tone, and
really believing she was giving comfort) "if you picked up a new
sweetheart in Liverpool. What gown are you going in, Mary?"

"Oh, I don't know and don't care," exclaimed Mary, sick and weary of
her visitor.

"Well, then! take my advice, and go in that blue merino. It's old
to be sure, and a bit worn at elbows, but folk won't notice that,
and th' colour suits you. Now mind, Mary. And I'll lend you my black
watered scarf," added she, really good-naturedly, according to her
sense of things, and withal, a little bit pleased at the idea of her
pet article of dress figuring away on the person of a witness at a
trial for murder.

"I'll bring it to-morrow before you start."

"No, don't!" said Mary; "thank you, but I don't want it."

"Why, what can you wear? I know all your clothes as well as I do my
own, and what is there you can wear? Not your old plaid shawl, I do
hope? You would not fancy this I have on, more nor the scarf, would
you?" said she, brightening up at the thought, and willing to lend
it, or any thing else.

"Oh Sally! don't go on talking a-that-ns; how can I think on dress at
such a time? When it's a matter of life and death to Jem?"

"Bless the girl! It's Jem, is it? Well now, I thought there was some
sweetheart in the back-ground, when you flew off so with Mr. Carson.
Then what in the name of goodness made him shoot Mr. Harry? After you
had given up going with him, I mean? Was he afraid you'd be on
again?"

"How dare you say he shot Mr. Harry?" asked Mary, firing up from the
state of languid indifference into which she had sunk while Sally had
been settling about her dress. "But it's no matter what you think
as did not know him. What grieves me is, that people should go on
thinking him guilty as did know him," she said, sinking back into her
former depressed tone and manner.

"And don't you think he did it?" asked Sally.

Mary paused; she was going on too fast with one so curious and
so unscrupulous. Besides she remembered how even she herself had,
at first, believed him guilty; and she felt it was not for her to
cast stones at those who, on similar evidence, inclined to the same
belief. None had given him much benefit of a doubt. None had faith in
his innocence. None but his mother; and there the heart loved more
than the head reasoned, and her yearning affection had never for an
instant entertained the idea that her Jem was a murderer. But Mary
disliked the whole conversation; the subject, the manner in which it
was treated, were all painful, and she had a repugnance to the person
with whom she spoke.

She was thankful, therefore, when Job Legh's voice was heard at the
door, as he stood with the latch in his hand, talking to a neighbour,
and when Sally jumped up in vexation and said, "There's that old
fogey coming in here, as I'm alive! Did your father set him to
look after you while he was away? or what brings the old chap
here? However, I'm off; I never could abide either him or his prim
grand-daughter. Goodbye, Mary."

So far in a whisper, then louder,

"If you think better of my offer about the scarf, Mary, just step in
to-morrow before nine, and you're quite welcome to it."

She and Job passed each other at the door, with mutual looks of
dislike, which neither took any pains to conceal.

"Yon's a bold, bad girl," said Job to Mary.

"She's very good-natured," replied Mary, too honourable to abuse a
visitor who had only that instant crossed her threshold, and gladly
dwelling on the good quality most apparent in Sally's character.

"Ay, ay! good-natured, generous, jolly, full of fun; there are a
number of other names for the good qualities the devil leaves his
childer, as baits to catch gudgeons with. D'ye think folk could be
led astray by one who was every way bad? Howe'er, that's not what I
came to talk about. I've seen Mr. Bridgenorth, and he is in a manner
of the same mind as me; he thinks it would have an awkward look, and
might tell against the poor lad on his trial; still if she's ill
she's ill, and it can't be helped."

"I don't know if she's so bad as all that," said Mary, who began to
dread her part in doing any thing which might tell against her poor
lover.

"Will you come and see her, Job? The doctor seemed to say as I liked,
not as he thought."

"That's because he had no great thought on the subject, either one
way or t'other," replied Job, whose contempt for medical men pretty
nearly equalled his respect for lawyers. "But I'll go and welcome. I
han not seen th' oud ladies since their sorrows, and it's but manners
to go and ax after them. Come along."

The room at Mrs. Wilson's had that still, changeless look you
must have often observed in the house of sickness or mourning. No
particular employment going on; people watching and waiting rather
than acting, unless in the more sudden and violent attacks; what
little movement is going on, so noiseless and hushed; the furniture
all arranged and stationary, with a view to the comfort of the
afflicted; the window-blinds drawn down to keep out the disturbing
variety of a sun-beam; the same saddened, serious look on the faces
of the in-dwellers; you fall back into the same train of thought with
all these associations, and forget the street, the outer world, in
the contemplation of the one stationary, absorbing interest within.

Mrs. Wilson sat quietly in her chair, with just the same look Mary
had left on her face; Mrs. Davenport went about with creaking shoes,
which made all the more noise from her careful and lengthened tread,
annoying the ears of those who were well, in this instance, far
more than the dulled senses of the sick and the sorrowful. Alice's
voice still was going on cheerfully in the upper room with incessant
talking and little laughs to herself, or perhaps in sympathy with her
unseen companions; "unseen," I say, in preference to "fancied," for
who knows whether God does not permit the forms of those who were
dearest when living, to hover round the bed of the dying?

Job spoke, and Mrs. Wilson answered.

So quietly, that it was unnatural under the circumstances. It made
a deeper impression on the old man than any token of mere bodily
illness could have done. If she had raved in delirium, or moaned in
fever, he could have spoken after his wont, and given his opinion,
his advice, and his consolation; now he was awed into silence.

At length he pulled Mary aside into a corner of the house-place where
Mrs. Wilson was sitting, and began to talk to her.

"Yo're right, Mary! She's no ways fit to go to Liverpool, poor soul.
Now I've seen her, I only wonder the doctor could ha' been unsettled
in his mind at th' first. Choose how it goes wi' poor Jem, she cannot
go. One way or another it will soon be over, and best to leave her in
the state she is till then."

"I was sure you would think so," said Mary.

But they were reckoning without their host. They esteemed her senses
gone, while, in fact, they were only inert, and could not convey
impressions rapidly to the over-burdened, troubled brain. They had
not noticed that her eyes had followed them (mechanically it seemed
at first) as they had moved away to the corner of the room; that her
face, hitherto so changeless, had begun to work with one or two of
the old symptoms of impatience.

But when they were silent she stood up, and startled them almost as
if a dead person had spoken, by saying clearly and decidedly--"I go
to Liverpool. I hear you and your plans; and I tell you I shall go
to Liverpool. If my words are to kill my son, they have already gone
forth out of my mouth, and nought can bring them back. But I will
have faith. Alice (up above) has often telled me I wanted faith, and
now I will have it. They cannot--they will not kill my child, my only
child. I will not be afeared. Yet, oh! I am so sick with terror. But
if he is to die, think ye not that I will see him again; ay! see him
at his trial? When all are hating him, he shall have his poor mother
near him, to give him all the comfort, eyes, and looks, and tears,
and a heart that is dead to all but him, can give; his poor old
mother, who knows how free he is from sin--in the sight of man at
least. They'll let me go to him, maybe, the very minute it's over;
and I know many Scripture texts (though you would not think it), that
may keep up his heart. I missed seeing him ere he went to yon prison,
but nought shall keep me away again one minute when I can see his
face; for maybe the minutes are numbered, and the count but small.
I know I can be a comfort to him, poor lad. You would not think
it, now, but he'd alway speak as kind and soft to me as if he were
courting me, like. He loved me above a bit; and am I to leave him now
to dree all the cruel slander they'll put upon him? I can pray for
him at each hard word they say against him, if I can do nought else;
and he'll know what his mother is doing for him, poor lad, by the
look on my face."

Still they made some look, or gesture of opposition to her wishes.
She turned sharp round on Mary, the old object of her pettish
attacks, and said,

"Now, wench! once for all! I tell yo this. _He_ could never guide me;
and he'd sense enough not to try. What he could na do, don't you try.
I shall go to Liverpool to-morrow, and find my lad, and stay with
him through thick and thin; and if he dies, why, perhaps, God of
His mercy will take me too. The grave is a sure cure for an aching
heart."

She sank back in her chair, quite exhausted by the sudden effort
she had made; but if they even offered to speak, she cut them short
(whatever the subject might be), with the repetition of the same
words, "I shall go to Liverpool."

No more could be said, the doctor's opinion had been so undecided;
Mr. Bridgenorth had given his legal voice in favour of her going, and
Mary was obliged to relinquish the idea of persuading her to remain
at home, if indeed under all the circumstances it could be thought
desirable.

"Best way will be," said Job, "for me to hunt out Will, early
to-morrow morning, and yo, Mary, come at after with Jane Wilson. I
know a decent woman where yo two can have a bed, and where we may
meet together when I've found Will, afore going to Mr. Bridgenorth's
at two o'clock; for, I can tell him, I'll not trust none of his
clerks for hunting up Will, if Jem's life is to depend on it."

Now Mary disliked this plan inexpressibly; her dislike was partly
grounded on reason, and partly on feeling. She could not bear the
idea of deputing to any one the active measures necessary to be taken
in order to save Jem. She felt as if they were her duty, her right.
She durst not trust to any one the completion of her plan; they might
not have energy, or perseverance, or desperation enough to follow out
the slightest chance; and her love would endow her with all these
qualities, independently of the terrible alternative which awaited
her in case all failed and Jem was condemned. No one could have her
motives; and consequently no one could have her sharpened brain, her
despairing determination. Besides (only that was purely selfish), she
could not endure the suspense of remaining quiet, and only knowing
the result when all was accomplished.

So with vehemence and impatience she rebutted every reason Job
adduced for his plan; and of course, thus opposed, by what appeared
to him wilfulness, he became more resolute, and angry words were
exchanged, and a feeling of estrangement rose up between them, for a
time, as they walked homewards.

But then came in Margaret with her gentleness, like an angel of
peace, so calm and reasonable, that both felt ashamed of their
irritation, and tacitly left the decision to her (only, by the way,
I think Mary could never have submitted if it had gone against her,
penitent and tearful as was her manner now to Job, the good old man
who was helping her to work for Jem, although they differed as to the
manner).

"Mary had better go," said Margaret to her grandfather, in a low
tone, "I know what she's feeling, and it will be a comfort to her
soon, may be, to think she did all she could herself. She would
perhaps fancy it might have been different; do, grandfather, let
her."

Margaret had still, you see, little or no belief in Jem's innocence;
and besides, she thought if Mary saw Will, and heard herself from him
that Jem had not been with him that Thursday night, it would in a
measure break the force of the blow which was impending.

"Let me lock up house, grandfather, for a couple of days, and go and
stay with Alice. It's but little one like me can do, I know" (she
added softly); "but, by the blessing o' God, I'll do it and welcome;
and here comes one kindly use o' money, I can hire them as will do
for her what I cannot. Mrs. Davenport is a willing body, and one who
knows sorrow and sickness, and I can pay her for her time, and keep
her there pretty near altogether. So let that be settled. And you
take Mrs. Wilson, dear grandad, and let Mary go find Will, and you
can all meet together at after, and I'm sure I wish you luck."

Job consented with only a few dissenting grunts; but on the whole,
with a very good grace for an old man who had been so positive only a
few minutes before.

Mary was thankful for Margaret's interference. She did not speak, but
threw her arms round Margaret's neck, and put up her rosy-red mouth
to be kissed; and even Job was attracted by the pretty, child-like
gesture; and when she drew near him, afterwards, like a little
creature sidling up to some person whom it feels to have offended, he
bent down and blessed her, as if she had been a child of his own.

To Mary the old man's blessing came like words of power.




CHAPTER XXVI.

THE JOURNEY TO LIVERPOOL.


   "Like a bark upon the sea,
     Life is floating over death;
   Above, below, encircling thee,
     Danger lurks in every breath.

   Parted art thou from the grave
     Only by a plank most frail;
   Tossed upon the restless wave,
     Sport of every fickle gale.

   Let the skies be e'er so clear,
     And so calm and still the sea,
   Shipwreck yet has he to fear,
     Who life's voyager will be."

   RÜCKERT.


The early trains for Liverpool, on Monday morning, were crowded by
attorneys, attorneys' clerks, plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses,
all going to the Assizes. They were a motley assembly, each with
some cause for anxiety stirring at his heart; though, after all,
that is saying little or nothing, for we are all of us in the same
predicament through life; each with a fear and a hope from childhood
to death. Among the passengers there was Mary Barton, dressed in the
blue gown and obnoxious plaid shawl.

Common as railroads are now in all places as a means of transit, and
especially in Manchester, Mary had never been on one before; and she
felt bewildered by the hurry, the noise of people, and bells, and
horns; the whiz and the scream of the arriving trains.

The very journey itself seemed to her a matter of wonder. She had a
back seat, and looked towards the factory-chimneys, and the cloud
of smoke which hovers over Manchester, with a feeling akin to the
"Heimweh." She was losing sight of the familiar objects of her
childhood for the first time; and unpleasant as those objects are to
most, she yearned after them with some of the same sentiment which
gives pathos to the thoughts of the emigrant.

The cloud-shadows which give beauty to Chat-Moss, the picturesque old
houses of Newton, what were they to Mary, whose heart was full of
many things? Yet she seemed to look at them earnestly as they glided
past; but she neither saw nor heard.

She neither saw nor heard till some well-known names fell upon her
ear.

Two lawyers' clerks were discussing the cases to come on that
Assizes; of course, "the murder-case," as it had come to be termed,
held a conspicuous place in their conversation.

They had no doubt of the result.

"Juries are always very unwilling to convict on circumstantial
evidence, it is true," said one, "but here there can hardly be any
doubt."

"If it had not been so clear a case," replied the other, "I should
have said they were injudicious in hurrying on the trial so much.
Still, more evidence might have been collected."

"They tell me," said the first speaker,--"the people in Gardener's
office I mean,--that it was really feared the old gentleman would
have gone out of his mind, if the trial had been delayed. He was with
Mr. Gardener as many as seven times on Saturday, and called him up
at night to suggest that some letter should be written, or something
done to secure the verdict."

"Poor old man," answered his companion, "who can wonder?--an only
son,--such a death,--the disagreeable circumstances attending it; I
had not time to read the _Guardian_ on Saturday, but I understand it
was some dispute about a factory girl."

"Yes, some such person. Of course she'll be examined, and Williams
will do it in style. I shall slip out from our court to hear him if
I can hit the nick of time."

"And if you can get a place, you mean, for depend upon it the court
will be crowded."

"Ay, ay, the ladies (sweet souls) will come in shoals to hear a trial
for murder, and see the murderer, and watch the judge put on his
black cap."

"And then go home and groan over the Spanish ladies who take delight
in bull-fights--'such unfeminine creatures!'"

Then they went on to other subjects.

It was but another drop to Mary's cup; but she was nearly in that
state which Crabbe describes,

   "For when so full the cup of sorrows flows
   Add but a drop, it instantly o'erflows."

And now they were in the tunnel!--and now they were in Liverpool;
and she must rouse herself from the torpor of mind and body which
was creeping over her; the result of much anxiety and fatigue, and
several sleepless nights.

She asked a policeman the way to Milk House Yard, and following his
directions with the _savoir faire_ of a town-bred girl, she reached a
little court leading out of a busy, thronged street, not far from the
Docks.

When she entered the quiet little yard she stopped to regain her
breath, and to gather strength, for her limbs trembled, and her heart
beat violently.

All the unfavourable contingencies she had, until now, forbidden
herself to dwell upon, came forward to her mind. The possibility,
the bare possibility, of Jem being an accomplice in the murder; the
still greater possibility that he had not fulfilled his intention of
going part of the way with Will, but had been led off by some little
accidental occurrence from his original intention; and that he had
spent the evening with those, whom it was now too late to bring
forward as witnesses.

But sooner or later she must know the truth; so taking courage she
knocked at the door of a house.

"Is this Mrs. Jones's?" she inquired.

"Next door but one," was the curt answer.

And even this extra minute was a reprieve.

Mrs. Jones was busy washing, and would have spoken angrily to the
person who knocked so gently at the door, if anger had been in her
nature; but she was a soft, helpless kind of woman, and only sighed
over the many interruptions she had had to her business that unlucky
Monday morning.

But the feeling which would have been anger in a more impatient
temper, took the form of prejudice against the disturber, whoever he
or she might be.

Mary's fluttered and excited appearance strengthened this prejudice
in Mrs. Jones's mind, as she stood, stripping the soap-suds off her
arms, while she eyed her visitor, and waited to be told what her
business was.

But no words would come. Mary's voice seemed choked up in her throat.

"Pray what do you want, young woman?" coldly asked Mrs. Jones at
last.

"I want--Oh! is Will Wilson here?"

"No, he is not," replied Mrs. Jones, inclining to shut the door in
her face.

"Is he not come back from the Isle of Man?" asked Mary, sickening.

"He never went; he stayed in Manchester too long; as perhaps you
know, already."

And again the door seemed closing.

But Mary bent forwards with suppliant action (as some young tree
bends, when blown by the rough, autumnal wind), and gasped out,

"Tell me--tell me--where is he?"

Mrs. Jones suspected some love affair, and, perhaps, one of not the
most creditable kind; but the distress of the pale young creature
before her was so obvious and so pitiable, that were she ever so
sinful, Mrs. Jones could no longer uphold her short, reserved manner.

"He's gone this very morning, my poor girl. Step in, and I'll tell
you about it."

"Gone!" cried Mary. "How gone? I must see him,--it's a matter of life
and death: he can save the innocent from being hanged,--he cannot be
gone,--how gone?"

"Sailed, my dear! sailed in the _John Cropper_ this very blessed
morning."

"Sailed!"




CHAPTER XXVII.

IN THE LIVERPOOL DOCKS.


   "Yon is our quay!
   Hark to the clamour in that miry road,
   Bounded and narrowed by yon vessel's load;
   The lumbering wealth she empties round the place,
   Package and parcel, hogshead, chest and case:
   While the loud seaman and the angry hind,
   Mingling in business, bellow to the wind."

   CRABBE.


Mary staggered into the house. Mrs. Jones placed her tenderly in a
chair, and there stood bewildered by her side.

"Oh, father! father!" muttered she, "what have you done?--What must I
do? must the innocent die?--or he--whom I fear--I fear--oh! what am I
saying?" said she, looking round affrighted, and seemingly reassured
by Mrs. Jones's countenance, "I am so helpless, so weak,--but a poor
girl after all. How can I tell what is right? Father! you have always
been so kind to me,--and you to be--never mind--never mind, all will
come right in the grave."

"Save us, and bless us!" exclaimed Mrs. Jones, "if I don't think
she's gone out of her wits!"

"No, I'm not!" said Mary, catching at the words, and with a strong
effort controlling the mind she felt to be wandering, while the red
blood flushed to scarlet the heretofore white cheek, "I'm not out of
my senses; there is so much to be done--so much--and no one but me to
do it, you know,--though I can't rightly tell what it is," looking up
with bewilderment into Mrs. Jones's face. "I must not go mad whatever
comes--at least not yet. No!" (bracing herself up) "something may yet
be done, and I must do it. Sailed! did you say? The _John Cropper_?
Sailed?"

"Ay! she went out of dock last night, to be ready for the morning's
tide."

"I thought she was not to sail till to-morrow," murmured Mary.

"So did Will (he's lodged here long, so we all call him 'Will'),"
replied Mrs. Jones. "The mate had told him so, I believe, and he
never knew different till he got to Liverpool on Friday morning; but
as soon as he heard, he gave up going to the Isle o' Man, and just
ran over to Rhyl with the mate, one John Harris, as has friends a bit
beyond Abergele; you may have heard him speak on him, for they are
great chums, though I've my own opinion of Harris."

"And he's sailed?" repeated Mary, trying by repetition to realise the
fact to herself.

"Ay, he went on board last night to be ready for the morning's tide,
as I said afore, and my boy went to see the ship go down the river,
and came back all agog with the sight. Here, Charley, Charley!" She
called out loudly for her son: but Charley was one of those boys who
are never "far to seek," as the Lancashire people say, when any thing
is going on; a mysterious conversation, an unusual event, a fire, or
a riot, any thing, in short; such boys are the little omnipresent
people of this world.

Charley had, in fact, been spectator and auditor all this time;
though for a little while he had been engaged in "dollying" and a few
other mischievous feats in the washing line, which had prevented his
attention from being fully given to his mother's conversation with
the strange girl who had entered.

"Oh, Charley! there you are! Did you not see the _John Cropper_ sail
down the river this morning? Tell the young woman about it, for I
think she hardly credits me."

"I saw her tugged down the river by a steam-boat, which comes to same
thing," replied he.

"Oh! if I had but come last night!" moaned Mary. "But I never thought
of it. I never thought but what he knew right when he said he would
be back from the Isle of Man on Monday morning, and not afore--and
now some one must die for my negligence!"

"Die!" exclaimed the lad. "How?"

"Oh! Will would have proved an _alibi_,--but he's gone,--and what am
I to do?"

"Don't give it up yet," cried the energetic boy, interested at once
in the case; "let's have a try for him. We are but where we were if
we fail."

Mary roused herself. The sympathetic "we" gave her heart and hope.
"But what can be done? You say he's sailed; what can be done?" But
she spoke louder, and in a more life-like tone.

"No! I did not say he'd sailed; mother said that, and women know
nought about such matters. You see" (proud of his office of
instructor, and insensibly influenced, as all about her were, by
Mary's sweet, earnest, lovely countenance) "there's sand-banks at the
mouth of the river, and ships can't get over them but at high-water;
especially ships of heavy burden, like the _John Cropper_. Now, she
was tugged down the river at low water, or pretty near, and will have
to lie some time before the water will be high enough to float her
over the banks. So hold up your head,--you've a chance yet, though
may be but a poor one."

"But what must I do?" asked Mary, to whom all this explanation had
been a vague mystery.

"Do!" said the boy, impatiently, "why, have not I told you? Only
women (begging your pardon) are so stupid at understanding about any
thing belonging to the sea;--you must get a boat, and make all haste,
and sail after him,--after the _John Cropper_. You may overtake her,
or you may not. It's just a chance; but she's heavy laden, and that's
in your favour. She'll draw many feet of water."

Mary had humbly and eagerly (oh, how eagerly!) listened to this young
Sir Oracle's speech; but try as she would, she could only understand
that she must make haste, and sail--somewhere--

"I beg your pardon," (and her little acknowledgment of inferiority
in this speech pleased the lad, and made him her still more zealous
friend). "I beg your pardon," said she, "but I don't know where to
get a boat. Are there boat-stands?"

The lad laughed outright.

"You're not long in Liverpool, I guess. Boat-stands! No; go down to
the pier,--any pier will do, and hire a boat,--you'll be at no loss
when once you are there. Only make haste."

"Oh, you need not tell me that, if I but knew how," said Mary,
trembling with eagerness. "But you say right,--I never was here
before, and I don't know my way to the place you speak on; only tell
me, and I'll not lose a minute."

"Mother!" said the wilful lad, "I'm going to show her the way to the
pier; I'll be back in an hour,--or so,--" he added in a lower tone.

And before the gentle Mrs. Jones could collect her scattered wits
sufficiently to understand half of the hastily formed plan, her son
was scudding down the street, closely followed by Mary's half-running
steps.

Presently he slackened his pace sufficiently to enable him to enter
into conversation with Mary, for once escaped from the reach of his
mother's recalling voice, he thought he might venture to indulge his
curiosity.

"Ahem!--What's your name? It's so awkward to be calling you young
woman."

"My name is Mary,--Mary Barton," answered she, anxious to propitiate
one who seemed so willing to exert himself in her behalf, or else
she grudged every word which caused the slightest relaxation in her
speed, although her chest seemed tightened, and her head throbbing,
from the rate at which they were walking.

"And you want Will Wilson to prove an _alibi_--is that it?"

"Yes--oh, yes--can we not cross now?"

"No, wait a minute; it's the teagle hoisting above your head I'm
afraid of;--and who is it that's to be tried?"

"Jem; oh, lad! can't we get past?"

They rushed under the great bales quivering in the air above their
heads and pressed onwards for a few minutes, till Master Charley
again saw fit to walk a little slower, and ask a few more questions.

"Mary, is Jem your brother, or your sweetheart, that you're so set
upon saving him?"

"No--no," replied she, but with something of hesitation, that made
the shrewd boy yet more anxious to clear up the mystery.

"Perhaps he's your cousin, then? Many a girl has a cousin who has not
a sweetheart."

"No, he's neither kith nor kin to me. What's the matter? What are you
stopping for?" said she, with nervous terror, as Charley turned back
a few steps, and peered up a side street.

"Oh, nothing to flurry you so, Mary. I heard you say to mother you
had never been in Liverpool before, and if you'll only look up this
street you may see the back windows of our Exchange. Such a building
as yon is! with 'natomy hiding under a blanket, and Lord Admiral
Nelson, and a few more people in the middle of the court! No! come
here," as Mary, in her eagerness, was looking at any window that
caught her eye first, to satisfy the boy. "Here, then, now you can
see it. You can say, now, you've seen Liverpool Exchange."

"Yes, to be sure--it's a beautiful window, I'm sure. But are we near
the boats? I'll stop as I come back, you know; only I think we'd
better get on now."

"Oh! if the wind's in your favour, you'll be down the river in no
time, and catch Will, I'll be bound; and if it's not, why, you know,
the minute it took you to look at the Exchange will be neither here
nor there."

Another rush onwards, till one of the long crossings near the docks
caused a stoppage, and gave Mary time for breathing, and Charley
leisure to ask another question.

"You've never said where you come from?"

"Manchester," replied she.

"Eh, then! you've a power of things to see. Liverpool beats
Manchester hollow, they say. A nasty, smoky hole, bean't it? Are you
bound to live there?"

"Oh, yes! it's my home."

"Well, I don't think I could abide a home in the middle of smoke.
Look there! now you see the river! That's something now you'd give
a deal for in Manchester. Look!"

And Mary did look, and saw down an opening made in the forest of
masts belonging to the vessels in dock, the glorious river, along
which white-sailed ships were gliding with the ensigns of all
nations, not "braving the battle," but telling of the distant lands,
spicy or frozen, that sent to that mighty mart for their comforts
or their luxuries; she saw small boats passing to and fro on that
glittering highway, but she also saw such puffs and clouds of
smoke from the countless steamers, that she wondered at Charley's
intolerance of the smoke of Manchester. Across the swing-bridge,
along the pier,--and they stood breathless by a magnificent dock,
where hundreds of ships lay motionless during the process of loading
and unloading. The cries of the sailors, the variety of languages
used by the passers-by, and the entire novelty of the sight compared
with any thing which Mary had ever seen, made her feel most helpless
and forlorn; and she clung to her young guide as to one who alone by
his superior knowledge could interpret between her and the new race
of men by whom she was surrounded,--for a new race sailors might
reasonably be considered, to a girl who had hitherto seen none but
inland dwellers, and those for the greater part factory people.

In that new world of sight and sound, she still bore one prevailing
thought, and though her eye glanced over the ships and the
wide-spreading river, her mind was full of the thought of reaching
Will.

"Why are we here?" asked she of Charley. "There are no little boats
about, and I thought I was to go in a little boat; those ships are
never meant for short distances, are they?"

"To be sure not," replied he, rather contemptuously. "But the _John
Cropper_ lay in this dock, and I know many of the sailors; and if I
could see one I knew, I'd ask him to run up the mast, and see if he
could catch a sight of her in the offing. If she's weighed her anchor
no use for your going, you know."

Mary assented quietly to this speech, as if she were as careless as
Charley seemed now to be about her overtaking Will; but in truth her
heart was sinking within her, and she no longer felt the energy which
had hitherto upheld her. Her bodily strength was giving way, and she
stood cold and shivering, although the noon-day sun beat down with
considerable power on the shadeless spot where she was standing.

"Here's Tom Bourne!" said Charley; and altering his manner from
the patronising key in which he had spoken to Mary, he addressed a
weather-beaten old sailor who came rolling along the pathway where
they stood, his hands in his pockets, and his quid in his mouth, with
very much the air of one who had nothing to do but look about him,
and spit right and left; addressing this old tar, Charley made known
to him his wish in slang, which to Mary was almost inaudible, and
quite unintelligible, and which I am too much of a land-lubber to
repeat correctly.

Mary watched looks and actions with a renovated keenness of
perception.

She saw the old man listen attentively to Charley; she saw him eye
her over from head to foot, and wind up his inspection with a little
nod of approbation (for her very shabbiness and poverty of dress were
creditable signs to the experienced old sailor); and then she watched
him leisurely swing himself on to a ship in the basin, and, borrowing
a glass, run up the mast with the speed of a monkey.

"He'll fall!" said she, in affright, clutching at Charley's arm, and
judging the sailor, from his storm-marked face and unsteady walk on
land, to be much older than he really was.

"Not he!" said Charley. "He's at the mast-head now. See! he's looking
through his glass, and using his arms as steady as if he were on
dry land. Why, I've been up the mast, many and many a time; only
don't tell mother. She thinks I'm to be a shoemaker, but I've made
up my mind to be a sailor; only there's no good arguing with a woman.
You'll not tell her, Mary?"

"Oh, see!" exclaimed she (his secret was very safe with her, for, in
fact, she had not heard it). "See! he's coming down; he's down. Speak
to him, Charley."

But unable to wait another instant she called out herself,

"Can you see the _John Cropper_? Is she there yet?"

"Ay, ay," he answered, and coming quickly up to them, he hurried them
away to seek for a boat, saying the bar was already covered, and in
an hour the ship would hoist her sails and be off. "You've the wind
right against you, and must use oars. No time to lose."

They ran to some steps leading down to the water. They beckoned to
some watermen, who, suspecting the real state of the case, appeared
in no hurry for a fare, but leisurely brought their boat alongside
the stairs, as if it were a matter of indifference to them whether
they were engaged or not, while they conversed together in few words,
and in an under-tone, respecting the charge they should make.

"Oh, pray make haste," called Mary. "I want you to take me to the
_John Cropper_. Where is she, Charley? Tell them--I don't rightly
know the words,--only make haste!"

"In the offing she is, sure enough, miss," answered one of the men,
shoving Charley on one side, regarding him as too young to be a
principal in the bargain.

"I don't think we can go, Dick," said he, with a wink to his
companion; "there's the gentleman over at New Brighton as wants us."

"But, mayhap, the young woman will pay us handsome for giving her a
last look at her sweetheart," interposed the other.

"Oh, how much do you want? Only make haste--I've enough to pay you,
but every moment is precious," said Mary.

"Ay, that it is. Less than an hour won't take us to the mouth of the
river, and she'll be off by two o'clock!"

Poor Mary's ideas of "plenty of money," however, were different to
those entertained by the boatmen. Only fourteen or fifteen shillings
remained out of the sovereign Margaret had lent her, and the boatmen,
imagining "plenty" to mean no less than several pounds, insisted
upon receiving a sovereign (an exorbitant fare, by the bye, although
reduced from their first demand of thirty shillings).

While Charley, with a boy's impatience of delay, and disregard of
money, kept urging,

"Give it 'em, Mary; they'll none of them take you for less. It's your
only chance. There's St. Nicholas ringing one!"

"I've only got fourteen and ninepence," cried she, in despair, after
counting over her money; "but I'll give you my shawl, and you can
sell it for four or five shillings,--oh! won't that much do?" asked
she, in such a tone of voice, that they must indeed have had hard
hearts who could refuse such agonised entreaty.

They took her on board.

And in less than five minutes she was rocking and tossing in a boat
for the first time in her life, alone with two rough, hard-looking
men.




CHAPTER XXVIII.

"JOHN CROPPER, AHOY!"


   "A wet sheet and a flowing sea,
     A wind that follows fast
   And fills the white and rustling sail,
     And bends the gallant mast!
   And bends the gallant mast, my boys,
     While, like the eagle free,
   Away the good ship flies, and leaves
     Old England on the lee."

   ALLAN CUNNINGHAM.


Mary had not understood that Charley was not coming with her. In
fact, she had not thought about it, till she perceived his absence,
as they pushed off from the landing-place, and remembered that she
had never thanked him for all his kind interest in her behalf; and
now his absence made her feel most lonely--even his, the little
mushroom friend of an hour's growth.

The boat threaded her way through the maze of larger vessels which
surrounded the shore, bumping against one, kept off by the oars from
going right against another, overshadowed by a third, until at length
they were fairly out on the broad river, away from either shore; the
sights and sounds of land being lost in the distance.

And then came a sort of pause.

Both wind and tide were against the two men, and labour as they would
they made but little way. Once Mary in her impatience had risen up to
obtain a better view of the progress they had made, but the men had
roughly told her to sit down immediately, and she had dropped on her
seat like a chidden child, although the impatience was still at her
heart.

But now she grew sure they were turning off from the straight course
which they had hitherto kept on the Cheshire side of the river,
whither they had gone to avoid the force of the current, and after
a short time she could not help naming her conviction, as a kind of
nightmare dread and belief came over her, that every thing animate
and inanimate was in league against her one sole aim and object of
overtaking Will.

They answered gruffly. They saw a boatman whom they knew, and were
desirous of obtaining his services as steersman, so that both might
row with greater effect. They knew what they were about. So she sat
silent with clenched hands while the parley went on, the explanation
was given, the favour asked and granted. But she was sickening all
the time with nervous fear.

They had been rowing a long, long time--half a day it seemed, at
least--yet Liverpool appeared still close at hand, and Mary began
almost to wonder that the men were not as much disheartened as she
was, when the wind, which had been hitherto against them, dropped,
and thin clouds began to gather over the sky, shutting out the sun,
and casting a chilly gloom over every thing.

There was not a breath of air, and yet it was colder than when the
soft violence of the westerly wind had been felt.

The men renewed their efforts. The boat gave a bound forwards
at every pull of the oars. The water was glassy and motionless,
reflecting tint by tint of the Indian-ink sky above. Mary shivered,
and her heart sank within her. Still now they evidently were making
progress. Then the steersman pointed to a rippling line in the river
only a little way off, and the men disturbed Mary, who was watching
the ships that lay in what appeared to her the open sea, to get at
their sails.

She gave a little start, and rose. Her patience, her grief, and
perhaps her silence, had begun to win upon the men.

"Yon second to the norrard is the _John Cropper_. Wind's right now,
and sails will soon carry us alongside of her."

He had forgotten (or perhaps he did not like to remind Mary) that the
same wind which now bore their little craft along with easy, rapid
motion, would also be favourable to the _John Cropper_.

But as they looked with straining eyes, as if to measure the
decreasing distance that separated them from her, they saw her sails
unfurled and flap in the breeze, till, catching the right point, they
bellied forth into white roundness, and the ship began to plunge and
heave, as if she were a living creature, impatient to be off.

"They're heaving anchor!" said one of the boatmen to the others, as
the faint musical cry of the sailors came floating over the waters
that still separated them.

Full of the spirit of the chase, though as yet ignorant of Mary's
motives, the men sprang to hoist another sail. It was fully as much
as the boat could bear, in the keen, gusty east wind which was now
blowing, and she bent, and laboured, and ploughed, and creaked
upbraidingly as if tasked beyond her strength; but she sped along
with a gallant swiftness.

They drew nearer, and they heard the distant "ahoy" more clearly. It
ceased. The anchor was up, and the ship was away.

Mary stood up, steadying herself by the mast, and stretched out her
arms, imploring the flying vessel to stay its course by that mute
action, while the tears streamed down her cheeks. The men caught
up their oars and hoisted them in the air, and shouted to arrest
attention.

They were seen by the men aboard the larger craft; but they were too
busy with all the confusion prevalent in an outward-bound vessel to
pay much attention. There were coils of ropes and seamen's chests
to be stumbled over at every turn; there were animals, not properly
secured, roaming bewildered about the deck, adding their pitiful
lowings and bleatings to the aggregate of noises. There were carcases
not cut up, looking like corpses of sheep and pigs rather than like
mutton and pork; there were sailors running here and there and
everywhere, having had no time to fall into method, and with their
minds divided between thoughts of the land and the people they had
left, and the present duties on board ship; while the captain strove
hard to procure some kind of order by hasty commands given in a loud,
impatient voice, to right and left, starboard and larboard, cabin and
steerage.

As he paced the deck with a chafed step, vexed at one or two little
mistakes on the part of the mate, and suffering himself from the pain
of separation from wife and children, but showing his suffering only
by his outward irritation, he heard a hail from the shabby little
river-boat that was striving to overtake his winged ship. For the
men fearing that, as the ship was now fairly over the bar, they
should only increase the distance between them, and being now within
shouting range, had asked of Mary her more particular desire.

Her throat was dry; all musical sound had gone out of her voice;
but in a loud harsh whisper she told the men her errand of life and
death, and they hailed the ship.

"We're come for one William Wilson, who is wanted to prove an _alibi_
in Liverpool Assize Courts to-morrow. James Wilson is to be tried for
a murder, done on Thursday night, when he was with William Wilson.
Any thing more, missis?" asked the boat-man of Mary, in a lower
voice, and taking his hands down from his mouth.

"Say I'm Mary Barton. Oh, the ship is going on! Oh, for the love of
Heaven, ask them to stop."

The boatman was angry at the little regard paid to his summons, and
called out again; repeating the message with the name of the young
woman who sent it, and interlarding it with sailors' oaths.

The ship flew along--away,--the boat struggled after.

They could see the captain take his speaking-trumpet. And oh! and
alas! they heard his words.

He swore a dreadful oath; he called Mary a disgraceful name; and he
said he would not stop his ship for any one, nor could he part with
a single hand, whoever swung for it.

The words came in unpitying clearness with their trumpet-sound. Mary
sat down, looking like one who prays in the death-agony. For her eyes
were turned up to that Heaven, where mercy dwelleth, while her blue
lips quivered, though no sound came. Then she bowed her head and hid
it in her hands.

"Hark! yon sailor hails us."

She looked up. And her heart stopped its beating to listen.

William Wilson stood as near the stern of the vessel as he could get;
and unable to obtain the trumpet from the angry captain, made a tube
of his own hands.

"So help me God, Mary Barton, I'll come back in the pilot-boat, time
enough to save the life of the innocent."

"What does he say?" asked Mary wildly, as the voice died away in the
increasing distance, while the boatmen cheered, in their kindled
sympathy with their passenger.

"What does he say?" repeated she. "Tell me. I could not hear."

She had heard with her ears, but her brain refused to recognise the
sense.

They repeated his speech, all three speaking at once, with many
comments; while Mary looked at them and then at the vessel now far
away.

"I don't rightly know about it," said she, sorrowfully. "What is the
pilot-boat?"

They told her, and she gathered the meaning out of the sailors' slang
which enveloped it. There was a hope still, although so slight and
faint.

"How far does the pilot go with the ship?"

To different distances they said. Some pilots would go as far as
Holyhead for the chance of the homeward-bound vessels; others only
took the ships over the Banks. Some captains were more cautious than
others, and the pilots had different ways. The wind was against
the homeward bound vessels, so perhaps the pilot aboard the _John
Cropper_ would not care to go far out.

"How soon would he come back?"

There were three boatmen, and three opinions, varying from twelve
hours to two days. Nay, the man who gave his vote for the longest
time, on having his judgment disputed, grew stubborn, and doubled
the time, and thought it might be the end of the week before the
pilot-boat came home.

They began disputing, and urging reasons; and Mary tried to
understand them; but independently of their nautical language, a veil
seemed drawn over her mind, and she had no clear perception of any
thing that passed. Her very words seemed not her own, and beyond her
power of control, for she found herself speaking quite differently to
what she meant.

One by one her hopes had fallen away, and left her desolate; and
though a chance yet remained, she could no longer hope. She felt
certain it, too, would fade and vanish. She sank into a kind of
stupor. All outward objects harmonised with her despair.

The gloomy leaden sky,--the deep, dark waters below, of a still
heavier shade of colour,--the cold, flat yellow shore in the
distance, which no ray lightened up,--the nipping, cutting wind.

She shivered with her depression of mind and body.

The sails were taken down, of course, on the return to Liverpool,
and the progress they made, rowing and tacking, was very slow. The
men talked together, disputing about the pilots at first, and then
about matters of local importance, in which Mary would have taken no
interest at any time, and she gradually became drowsy; irrepressibly
so, indeed, for in spite of her jerking efforts to keep awake she
sank away to the bottom of the boat, and there lay couched on a rough
heap of sails, rope, and tackle of various kinds.

The measured beat of the waters against the sides of the boat, and
the musical boom of the more distant waves, were more lulling than
silence, and she slept sound.

Once she opened her eyes heavily, and dimly saw the old gray, rough
boatman (who had stood out the most obstinately for the full fare)
covering her with his thick pea-jacket. He had taken it off on
purpose, and was doing it tenderly in his way, but before she could
rouse herself up to thank him she had dropped off to sleep again.

At last, in the dusk of evening, they arrived at the landing-place
from which they had started some hours before. The men spoke to Mary,
but though she mechanically replied, she did not stir; so, at length,
they were obliged to shake her. She stood up, shivering and puzzled
as to her whereabouts.

"Now tell me where you are bound to, missis," said the gray old man,
"and maybe I can put you in the way."

She slowly comprehended what he said, and went through the process of
recollection; but very dimly, and with much labour. She put her hand
into her pocket and pulled out her purse, and shook its contents into
the man's hand; and then began meekly to unpin her shawl, although
they had turned away without asking for it.

"No, no!" said the older man, who lingered on the step before
springing into the boat, and to whom she mutely offered the shawl.

"Keep it! we donnot want it. It were only for to try you,--some folks
say they've no more blunt, when all the while they've getten a mint."

"Thank you," said she, in a dull, low tone.

"Where are you bound to? I axed that question afore," said the gruff
old fellow.

"I don't know. I'm a stranger," replied she, quietly, with a strange
absence of anxiety under the circumstances.

"But you mun find out then," said he, sharply, "pier-head's no place
for a young woman to be standing on, gape-saying."

"I've a card somewhere as will tell me," she answered, and the man,
partly relieved, jumped into the boat, which was now pushing off to
make way for the arrivals from some steamer.

Mary felt in her pocket for the card, on which was written the name
of the street where she was to have met Mr. Bridgenorth at two
o'clock; where Job and Mrs. Wilson were to have been, and where
she was to have learnt from the former the particulars of some
respectable lodging. It was not to be found.

She tried to brighten her perceptions, and felt again, and took
out the little articles her pocket contained, her empty purse, her
pocket-handkerchief, and such little things, but it was not there.

In fact she had dropped it when, so eager to embark, she had pulled
out her purse to reckon up her money.

She did not know this, of course. She only knew it was gone.

It added but little to the despair that was creeping over her. But
she tried a little more to help herself, though every minute her mind
became more cloudy. She strove to remember where Will had lodged, but
she could not; name, street, every thing had passed away, and it did
not signify; better she were lost than found.

She sat down quietly on the top step of the landing, and gazed down
into the dark, dank water below. Once or twice a spectral thought
loomed among the shadows of her brain; a wonder whether beneath that
cold dismal surface there would not be rest from the troubles of
earth. But she could not hold an idea before her for two consecutive
moments; and she forgot what she thought about before she could act
upon it.

So she continued sitting motionless, without looking up, or regarding
in any way the insults to which she was subjected.

Through the darkening light the old boatman had watched her:
interested in her in spite of himself, and his scoldings of himself.

When the landing-place was once more comparatively clear, he made his
way towards it, across boats, and along planks, swearing at himself
while he did so, for an old fool.

He shook Mary's shoulder violently.

"D---- you, I ask you again where you're bound to? Don't sit there,
stupid. Where are you going to?"

"I don't know," sighed Mary.

"Come, come; avast with that story. You said a bit ago you'd a card,
which was to tell you where to go."

"I had, but I've lost it. Never mind."

She looked again down upon the black mirror below.

He stood by her, striving to put down his better self; but he could
not. He shook her again. She looked up, as if she had forgotten him.

"What do you want?" asked she, wearily.

"Come with me, and be d----d to you!" replied he, clutching her arm
to pull her up.

She arose and followed him, with the unquestioning docility of a
little child.




CHAPTER XXIX.

A TRUE BILL AGAINST JEM.


   "There are who, living by the legal pen,
   Are held in honour--honourable men."

   CRABBE.


At five minutes before two, Job Legh stood upon the door-step of the
house where Mr. Bridgenorth lodged at Assize time. He had left Mrs.
Wilson at the dwelling of a friend of his, who had offered him a room
for the old woman and Mary: a room which had frequently been his, on
his occasional visits to Liverpool, but which he was thankful now to
have obtained for them, as his own sleeping-place was a matter of
indifference to him, and the town appeared crowded and disorderly on
the eve of the Assizes.

He was shown in to Mr. Bridgenorth, who was writing. Mary and Will
Wilson had not yet arrived, being, as you know, far away on the broad
sea; but of this Job of course knew nothing, and he did not as yet
feel much anxiety about their non-appearance; he was more curious to
know the result of Mr. Bridgenorth's interview that morning with Jem.

"Why, yes," said Mr. Bridgenorth, putting down his pen, "I
have seen him, but to little purpose, I'm afraid. He's very
impracticable--very. I told him, of course, that he must be perfectly
open with me, or else I could not be prepared for the weak points. I
named your name with the view of unlocking his confidence, but--"

"What did he say?" asked Job, breathlessly.

"Why, very little. He barely answered me. Indeed, he refused to
answer some questions--positively refused. I don't know what I can do
for him."

"Then you think him guilty, sir?" said Job, despondingly.

"No, I don't," replied Mr. Bridgenorth, quickly and decisively. "Much
less than I did before I saw him. The impression (mind, 'tis only
impression; I rely upon your caution, not to take it for fact)--the
impression," with an emphasis on the word, "he gave me is, that he
knows something about the affair, but what, he will not say; and so
the chances are, if he persists in his obstinacy, he'll be hung.
That's all."

He began to write again, for he had no time to lose.

"But he must not be hung," said Job, with vehemence.

Mr. Bridgenorth looked up, smiled a little, but shook his head.

"What did he say, sir, if I may be so bold as to ask?" continued Job.

"His words were few enough, and he was so reserved and short, that
as I said before, I can only give you the impression they conveyed
to me. I told him of course who I was, and for what I was sent. He
looked pleased, I thought,--at least his face (sad enough when I went
in, I assure ye) brightened a little; but he said he had nothing to
say, no defence to make. I asked him if he was guilty, then; and by
way of opening his heart I said I understood he had had provocation
enough, inasmuch as I heard that the girl was very lovely, and had
jilted him to fall desperately in love with that handsome young
Carson (poor fellow!). But James Wilson did not speak one way or
another. I then went to particulars. I asked him if the gun was his,
as his mother had declared. He had not heard of her admission it was
evident, from his quick way of looking up, and the glance of his eye;
but when he saw I was observing him, he hung down his head again, and
merely said she was right; it was his gun."

"Well!" said Job, impatiently, as Mr. Bridgenorth paused.

"Nay! I have little more to tell you," continued that gentleman. "I
asked him to inform me in all confidence, how it came to be found
there. He was silent for a time, and then refused. Not only refused
to answer that question, but candidly told me he would not say
another word on the subject, and, thanking me for my trouble and
interest in his behalf, he all but dismissed me. Ungracious enough on
the whole, was it not, Mr. Legh? And yet, I assure ye, I am twenty
times more inclined to think him innocent than before I had the
interview."

"I wish Mary Barton would come," said Job, anxiously. "She and Will
are a long time about it."

"Ay, that's our only chance, I believe," answered Mr. Bridgenorth,
who was writing again. "I sent Johnson off before twelve to serve him
with his sub-poena, and to say I wanted to speak with him; he'll be
here soon, I've no doubt."

There was a pause. Mr. Bridgenorth looked up again, and spoke.

"Mr. Duncombe promised to be here to speak to his character. I sent
him a subpoena on Saturday night. Though after all, juries go very
little by such general and vague testimony as that to character.
It is very right that they should not often; but in this instance
unfortunate for us, as we must rest our case on the _alibi_."

The pen went again, scratch, scratch over the paper.

Job grew very fidgetty. He sat on the edge of his chair, the more
readily to start up when Will and Mary should appear. He listened
intently to every noise and every step on the stair.

Once he heard a man's footstep, and his old heart gave a leap of
delight. But it was only Mr. Bridgenorth's clerk, bringing him a
list of those cases in which the grand jury had found true bills.
He glanced it over and pushed it to Job, merely saying,

"Of course we expected this," and went on with his writing.

There was a true bill against James Wilson. Of course. And yet Job
felt now doubly anxious and sad. It seemed the beginning of the end.
He had got, by imperceptible degrees, to think Jem innocent. Little
by little this persuasion had come upon him.

Mary (tossing about in the little boat on the broad river) did not
come, nor did Will.

Job grew very restless. He longed to go and watch for them out of the
window, but feared to interrupt Mr. Bridgenorth. At length his desire
to look out was irresistible, and he got up and walked carefully and
gently across the room, his boots creaking at every cautious step.
The gloom which had overspread the sky, and the influence of which
had been felt by Mary on the open water, was yet more perceptible
in the dark, dull street. Job grew more and more fidgetty. He was
obliged to walk about the room, for he could not keep still; and he
did so, regardless of Mr. Bridgenorth's impatient little motions
and noises, as the slow, stealthy, creaking movements were heard,
backwards and forwards, behind his chair.

He really liked Job, and was interested for Jem, else his nervousness
would have overcome his sympathy long before it did. But he could
hold out no longer against the monotonous, grating sound; so at last
he threw down his pen, locked his portfolio, and taking up his hat
and gloves, he told Job he must go to the courts.

"But Will Wilson is not come," said Job, in dismay. "Just wait while
I run to his lodgings. I would have done it before, but I thought
they'd be here every minute, and I were afraid of missing them. I'll
be back in no time."

"No, my good fellow, I really must go. Besides, I begin to think
Johnson must have made a mistake, and have fixed with this William
Wilson to meet me at the courts. If you like to wait for him here,
pray make use of my room; but I've a notion I shall find him there:
in which case, I'll send him to your lodgings; shall I? You know
where to find me. I shall be here again by eight o'clock, and with
the evidence of this witness that's to prove the _alibi_, I'll have
the brief drawn out, and in the hands of counsel to-night."

So saying he shook hands with Job, and went his way. The old man
considered for a minute as he lingered at the door, and then bent
his steps towards Mrs. Jones's, where he knew (from reference to
queer, odd, heterogeneous memoranda, in an ancient black-leather
pocket-book) that Will lodged, and where he doubted not he should
hear both of him and of Mary.

He went there, and gathered what intelligence he could out of Mrs.
Jones's slow replies.

He asked if a young woman had been there that morning, and if she had
seen Will Wilson. "No!"

"Why not?"

"Why, bless you, 'cause he had sailed some hours before she came
asking for him."

There was a dead silence, broken only by the even, heavy sound of
Mrs. Jones's ironing.

"Where is the young woman now?" asked Job.

"Somewhere down at the docks," she thought. "Charley would know, if
he was in, but he wasn't. He was in mischief, somewhere or other, she
had no doubt. Boys always were. He would break his neck some day, she
knew;" so saying, she quietly spat upon her fresh iron, to test its
heat, and then went on with her business.

Job could have boxed her, he was in such a state of irritation. But
he did not, and he had his reward. Charley came in, whistling with
an air of indifference, assumed to carry off his knowledge of the
lateness of the hour to which he had lingered about the docks.

"Here's an old man come to know where the young woman is who went out
with thee this morning," said his mother, after she had bestowed on
him a little motherly scolding.

"Where she is now, I don't know. I saw her last sailing down the
river after the _John Cropper_. I'm afeared she won't reach her; wind
changed and she would be under weigh, and over the bar in no time.
She should have been back by now."

It took Job some little time to understand this, from the confused
use of the feminine pronoun. Then he inquired how he could best find
Mary.

"I'll run down again to the pier," said the boy; "I'll warrant I'll
find her."

"Thou shalt do no such a thing," said his mother, setting her back
against the door. The lad made a comical face at Job, which met with
no responsive look from the old man, whose sympathies were naturally
in favour of the parent; although he would thankfully have availed
himself of Charley's offer, for he was weary, and anxious to return
to poor Mrs. Wilson, who would be wondering what had become of him.

"How can I best find her? Who did she go with, lad?"

But Charley was sullen at his mother's exercise of authority before
a stranger, and at that stranger's grave looks when he meant to have
made him laugh.

"They were river boatmen;--that's all I know," said he.

"But what was the name of their boat?" persevered Job.

"I never took no notice;--the Anne, or William,--or some of them
common names, I'll be bound."

"What pier did she start from?" asked Job, despairingly.

"Oh, as for that matter, it were the stairs on the Prince's Pier she
started from; but she'll not come back to the same, for the American
steamer came up with the tide, and anchored close to it, blocking up
the way for all the smaller craft. It's a rough evening too, to be
out on," he maliciously added.

"Well, God's will be done! I did hope we could have saved the lad,"
said Job, sorrowfully; "but I'm getten very doubtful again. I'm
uneasy about Mary, too,--very. She's a stranger in Liverpool."

"So she told me," said Charley. "There's traps about for young women
at every corner. It's a pity she's no one to meet her when she
lands."

"As for that," replied Job, "I don't see how any one could meet her
when we can't tell where she would come to. I must trust to her
coming right. She's getten spirit and sense. She'll most likely be
for coming here again. Indeed, I don't know what else she can do, for
she knows no other place in Liverpool. Missus, if she comes, will
you give your son leave to bring her to No. 8, Back Garden Court,
where there's friends waiting for her? I'll give him sixpence for his
trouble."

Mrs. Jones, pleased with the reference to her, gladly promised. And
even Charley, indignant as he was at first at the idea of his motions
being under the control of his mother, was mollified at the prospect
of the sixpence, and at the probability of getting nearer to the
heart of the mystery.

But Mary never came.




CHAPTER XXX.

JOB LEGH'S DECEPTION.


   "Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans;
     The clock gives warning for eleven;
   'Tis on the stroke--'He must be near,'
   Quoth Betty, 'and will soon be here,
     As sure as there's a moon in heaven.'

   The clock is on the stroke of twelve,
     And Johnny is not yet in sight,
   --The moon's in heaven, as Betty sees,
   But Betty is not quite at ease;
     And Susan has a dreadful night."

   WORDSWORTH.


Job found Mrs. Wilson pacing about in a restless way; not speaking to
the woman at whose house she was staying, but occasionally heaving
such deep oppressive sighs as quite startled those around her.

"Well!" said she, turning sharp round in her tottering walk up and
down, as Job came in.

"Well, speak!" repeated she, before he could make up his mind what to
say; for, to tell the truth, he was studying for some kind-hearted
lie which might soothe her for a time. But now the real state of the
case came blurting forth in answer to her impatient questioning.

"Will's not to the fore. But he'll may be turn up yet, time enough."

She looked at him steadily for a minute, as if almost doubting if
such despair could be in store for her as his words seemed to imply.
Then she slowly shook her head, and said, more quietly than might
have been expected from her previous excited manner,

"Don't go for to say that! Thou dost not think it. Thou'rt well-nigh
hopeless, like me. I seed all along my lad would be hung for what
he never did. And better he were, and were shut [49] of this weary
world, where there's neither justice nor mercy left."


   [Footnote 49: "Shut," quit.]


She looked up with tranced eyes as if praying to that throne where
mercy ever abideth, and then sat down.

"Nay, now thou'rt off at a gallop," said Job. "Will has sailed this
morning for sure, but that brave wench, Mary Barton, is after him,
and will bring him back, I'll be bound, if she can but get speech on
him. She's not back yet. Come, come, hold up thy head. It will all
end right."

"It will all end right," echoed she; "but not as thou tak'st it. Jem
will be hung, and will go to his father and the little lads, where
the Lord God wipes away all tears, and where the Lord Jesus speaks
kindly to the little ones, who look about for the mothers they left
upon earth. Eh, Job, yon's a blessed land, and I long to go to it,
and yet I fret because Jem is hastening there. I would not fret if
he and I could lie down to-night to sleep our last sleep; not a bit
would I fret if folk would but know him to be innocent--as I do."

"They'll know it sooner or later, and repent sore if they've hanged
him for what he never did," replied Job.

"Ay, that they will. Poor souls! May God have mercy on them when they
find out their mistake."

Presently Job grew tired of sitting waiting, and got up, and hung
about the door and window, like some animal wanting to go out. It was
pitch dark, for the moon had not yet risen.

"You just go to bed," said he to the widow. "You'll want your
strength for to-morrow. Jem will be sadly off, if he sees you so cut
up as you look to-night. I'll step down again and find Mary. She'll
be back by this time. I'll come and tell you every thing, never fear.
But, now, you go to bed."

"Thou'rt a kind friend, Job Legh, and I'll go, as thou wishest me.
But, oh! mind thou com'st straight off to me, and bring Mary as soon
as thou'st lit on her." She spoke low, but very calmly.

"Ay, ay!" replied Job, slipping out of the house.

He went first to Mr. Bridgenorth's, where it had struck him that Will
and Mary might be all this time waiting for him.

They were not there, however. Mr. Bridgenorth had just come in, and
Job went breathlessly up-stairs to consult with him as to the state
of the case.

"It's a bad job," said the lawyer, looking very grave, while he
arranged his papers. "Johnson told me how it was; the woman that
Wilson lodged with told him. I doubt it's but a wild-goose chase
of the girl Barton. Our case must rest on the uncertainty of
circumstantial evidence, and the goodness of the prisoner's previous
character. A very vague and weak defence. However, I've engaged Mr.
Clinton as counsel, and he'll make the best of it. And now, my good
fellow, I must wish you good-night, and turn you out of doors. As it
is, I shall have to sit up into the small hours. Did you see my clerk
as you came up-stairs? You did! Then may I trouble you to ask him to
step up immediately?"

After this Job could not stay, and, making his humble bow, he left
the room.

Then he went to Mrs. Jones's. She was in, but Charley had slipped off
again. There was no holding that boy. Nothing kept him but lock and
key, and they did not always; for once she had him locked up in the
garret, and he had got off through the skylight. Perhaps now he was
gone to see after the young woman down at the docks. He never wanted
an excuse to be there.

Unasked, Job took a chair, resolved to await Charley's re-appearance.

Mrs. Jones ironed and folded her clothes, talking all the time of
Charley and her husband, who was a sailor in some ship bound for
India, and who, in leaving her their boy, had evidently left her
rather more than she could manage. She moaned and croaked over
sailors, and sea-port towns, and stormy weather, and sleepless
nights, and trousers all over tar and pitch, long after Job had left
off attending to her, and was only trying to hearken to every step
and every voice in the street.

At last Charley came in, but he came alone.

"Yon Mary Barton has getten into some scrape or another," said he,
addressing himself to Job. "She's not to be heard of at any of the
piers; and Bourne says it were a boat from the Cheshire side as she
went aboard of. So there's no hearing of her till to-morrow morning."

"To-morrow morning she'll have to be in court at nine o'clock, to
bear witness on a trial," said Job, sorrowfully.

"So she said; at least somewhat of the kind," said Charley, looking
desirous to hear more. But Job was silent.

He could not think of any thing further that could be done; so he
rose up, and, thanking Mrs. Jones for the shelter she had given him,
he went out into the street; and there he stood still, to ponder over
probabilities and chances.

After some little time he slowly turned towards the lodging where
he had left Mrs. Wilson. There was nothing else to be done; but he
loitered on the way, fervently hoping that her weariness and her woes
might have sent her to sleep before his return, that he might be
spared her questionings.

He went very gently into the house-place where the sleepy landlady
awaited his coming and his bringing the girl, who, she had been told,
was to share the old woman's bed.

But in her sleepy blindness she knocked things so about in lighting
the candle (she could see to have a nap by fire-light, she said),
that the voice of Mrs. Wilson was heard from the little back-room,
where she was to pass the night.

"Who's there?"

Job gave no answer, and kept down his breath, that she might think
herself mistaken. The landlady, having no such care, dropped the
snuffers with a sharp metallic sound, and then, by her endless
apologies, convinced the listening woman that Job had returned.

"Job! Job Legh!" she cried out, nervously.

"Eh, dear!" said Job to himself, going reluctantly to her bed-room
door. "I wonder if one little lie would be a sin as things stand? It
would happen give her sleep, and she won't have sleep for many and
many a night (not to call sleep), if things goes wrong to-morrow.
I'll chance it, any way."

"Job! art thou there?" asked she again with a trembling impatience
that told in every tone of her voice.

"Ay! sure! I thought thou'd ha' been asleep by this time."

"Asleep! How could I sleep till I knowed if Will were found?"

"Now for it," muttered Job to himself. Then in a louder voice, "Never
fear! he's found, and safe, ready for to-morrow."

"And he'll prove that thing for my poor lad, will he? He'll bear
witness that Jem were with him? Oh, Job, speak! tell me all!"

"In for a penny, in for a pound," thought Job. "Happen one prayer
will do for the sum total. Any rate, I must go on now.--Ay, ay,"
shouted he, through the door. "He can prove all; and Jem will come
off as clear as a new-born babe."

He could hear Mrs. Wilson's rustling movements, and in an instant
guessed she was on her knees, for he heard her trembling voice
uplifted in thanksgiving and praise to God, stopped at times by sobs
of gladness and relief.

And when he heard this, his heart misgave him; for he thought of the
awful enlightening, the terrible revulsion of feeling that awaited
her in the morning. He saw the short-sightedness of falsehood; but
what could he do now?

While he listened, she ended her grateful prayers.

"And Mary? Thou'st found her at Mrs. Jones's, Job?" said she,
continuing her inquiries.

He gave a great sigh.

"Yes, she was there, safe enough, second time of going.--God forgive
me!" muttered he, "who'd ha' thought of my turning out such an arrant
liar in my old days?"

"Bless the wench! Is she here? Why does she not come to bed? I'm sure
she's need."

Job coughed away his remains of conscience, and made answer,

"She was a bit weary, and o'er done with her sail; and Mrs. Jones
axed her to stay there all night. It was nigh at hand to the courts,
where she will have to be in the morning."

"It comes easy enough after a while," groaned out Job. "The father
of lies helps one, I suppose, for now my speech comes as natural as
truth. She's done questioning now, that's one good thing. I'll be off
before Satan and she are at me again."

He went to the house-place, where the landlady stood wearily waiting.
Her husband was in bed, and asleep long ago.

But Job had not yet made up his mind what to do. He could not go to
sleep, with all his anxieties, if he were put into the best bed in
Liverpool.

"Thou'lt let me sit up in this arm-chair," said he at length to the
woman, who stood, expecting his departure.

He was an old friend, so she let him do as he wished. But, indeed,
she was too sleepy to have opposed him. She was too glad to be
released and go to bed.




CHAPTER XXXI.

HOW MARY PASSED THE NIGHT.


                           "To think
   That all this long interminable night,
   Which I have passed in thinking on two words--
   'Guilty'--'Not Guilty!'--like one happy moment
   O'er many a head hath flown unheeded by;
   O'er happy sleepers dreaming in their bliss
   Of bright to-morrows--or far happier still,
   With deep breath buried in forgetfulness.
   O all the dismallest images of death
   Did swim before my eyes!"

   WILSON.


And now, where was Mary?

How Job's heart would have been relieved of one of its cares if he
could have seen her: for he was in a miserable state of anxiety about
her; and many and many a time through that long night he scolded her
and himself; her for her obstinacy, and himself for his weakness in
yielding to her obstinacy, when she insisted on being the one to
follow and find out Will.

She did not pass that night in bed any more than Job; but she was
under a respectable roof, and among kind, though rough people.

She had offered no resistance to the old boatman, when he had
clutched her arm, in order to insure her following him, as he
threaded the crowded dock-ways, and dived up strange bye-streets. She
came on meekly after him, scarcely thinking in her stupor where she
was going, and glad (in a dead, heavy way) that some one was deciding
things for her.

He led her to an old-fashioned house, almost as small as house could
be, which had been built long ago, before all the other part of
the street, and had a country-town look about it in the middle of
that bustling back street. He pulled her into the house-place; and
relieved to a certain degree of his fear of losing her on the way, he
exclaimed,

"There!" giving a great slap of one hand on her back.

The room was light and bright, and roused Mary (perhaps the slap on
her back might help a little, too), and she felt the awkwardness
of accounting for her presence to a little bustling old woman who
had been moving about the fire-place on her entrance. The boatman
took it very quietly, never deigning to give any explanation, but
sitting down in his own particular chair, and chewing tobacco, while
he looked at Mary with the most satisfied air imaginable, half
triumphantly, as if she were the captive of his bow and spear, and
half defyingly, as if daring her to escape.

The old woman, his wife, stood still, poker in hand, waiting to be
told who it was that her husband had brought home so unceremoniously;
but, as she looked in amazement the girl's cheek flushed, and then
blanched to a dead whiteness; a film came over her eyes, and catching
at the dresser for support in that hot whirling room, she fell in a
heap on the floor.

Both man and wife came quickly to her assistance. They raised her up,
still insensible, and he supported her on one knee, while his wife
pattered away for some cold fresh water. She threw it straight over
Mary; but though it caused a great sob, the eyes still remained
closed, and the face as pale as ashes.

"Who is she, Ben?" asked the woman, as she rubbed her unresisting,
powerless hands.

"How should I know?" answered her husband gruffly.

"Well-a-well!" (in a soothing tone, such as you use to irritated
children), and as if half to herself, "I only thought you might, you
know, as you brought her home. Poor thing! we must not ask aught
about her, but that she needs help. I wish I'd my salts at home, but
I lent 'em to Mrs. Burton, last Sunday in church, for she could not
keep awake through the sermon. Dear-a-me, how white she is!"

"Here! you hold her up a bit," said her husband.

She did as he desired, still crooning to herself, not caring for his
short, sharp interruptions as she went on; and, indeed, to her old,
loving heart, his crossest words fell like pearls and diamonds, for
he had been the husband of her youth; and even he, rough and crabbed
as he was, was secretly soothed by the sound of her voice, although
not for worlds, if he could have helped it, would he have shown any
of the love that was hidden beneath his rough outside.

"What's the old fellow after?" said she, bending over Mary, so as to
accommodate the drooping head. "Taking my pen, as I've had better
nor five year. Bless us, and save us! he's burning it! Ay, I see now,
he's his wits about him; burnt feathers is always good for a faint.
But they don't bring her round, poor wench! Now what's he after
next? Well! he is a bright one, my old man! That I never thought of
that, to be sure!" exclaimed she, as he produced a square bottle of
smuggled spirits, labelled "Golden Wasser," from a corner cupboard in
their little room.

"That'll do!" said she, as the dose he poured into Mary's open mouth
made her start and cough. "Bless the man! It's just like him to be so
tender and thoughtful!"

"Not a bit!" snarled he, as he was relieved by Mary's returning
colour, and opened eyes, and wondering, sensible gaze; "not a bit!
I never was such a fool afore."

His wife helped Mary to rise, and placed her in a chair.

"All's right now, young woman?" asked the boatman, anxiously.

"Yes, sir, and thank you. I'm sure, sir, I don't know rightly how to
thank you," faltered Mary, softly forth.

"Be hanged to you and your thanks." And he shook himself, took his
pipe, and went out without deigning another word; leaving his wife
sorely puzzled as to the character and history of the stranger within
her doors.

Mary watched the boatman leave the house, and then, turning her
sorrowful eyes to the face of her hostess, she attempted feebly to
rise, with the intention of going away,--where she knew not.

"Nay! nay! who e'er thou be'st, thou'rt not fit to go out into the
street. Perhaps" (sinking her voice a little) "thou'rt a bad one; I
almost misdoubt thee, thou'rt so pretty. Well-a-well! it's the bad
ones as have the broken hearts, sure enough; good folk never get
utterly cast down, they've always getten hope in the Lord: it's the
sinful as bear the bitter, bitter grief in their crushed hearts, poor
souls; it's them we ought, most of all, to pity and to help. She
shanna leave the house to-night, choose who she is,--worst woman in
Liverpool, she shanna. I wished I knew where th' old man picked her
up, that I do."

Mary had listened feebly to this soliloquy, and now tried to satisfy
her hostess in weak, broken sentences.

"I'm not a bad one, missis, indeed. Your master took me out to sea
after a ship as had sailed. There was a man in it as might save a
life at the trial to-morrow. The captain would not let him come, but
he says he'll come back in the pilot-boat." She fell to sobbing at
the thought of her waning hopes, and the old woman tried to comfort
her, beginning with her accustomed,

"Well-a-well! and he'll come back, I'm sure. I know he will; so keep
up your heart. Don't fret about it. He's sure to be back."

"Oh! I'm afraid! I'm sore afraid he won't," cried Mary, consoled,
nevertheless, by the woman's assertions, all groundless as she knew
them to be.

Still talking half to herself and half to Mary, the old woman
prepared tea, and urged her visitor to eat and refresh herself. But
Mary shook her head at the proffered food, and only drank a cup of
tea with thirsty eagerness. For the spirits had thrown her into a
burning heat, and rendered each impression received through her
senses of the most painful distinctness and intensity, while her head
ached in a terrible manner.

She disliked speaking, her power over her words seemed so utterly
gone. She used quite different expressions to those she intended. So
she kept silent, while Mrs. Sturgis (for that was the name of her
hostess) talked away, and put her tea-things by, and moved about
incessantly, in a manner that increased the dizziness in Mary's head.
She felt as if she ought to take leave for the night and go. But
where?

Presently the old man came back, crosser and gruffer than when he
went away. He kicked aside the dry shoes his wife had prepared for
him, and snarled at all she said. Mary attributed this to his finding
her still there, and gathered up her strength for an effort to leave
the house. But she was mistaken. By-and-bye, he said (looking right
into the fire, as if addressing it), "Wind's right against them!"

"Ay, ay, and is it so?" said his wife, who, knowing him well,
knew that his surliness proceeded from some repressed sympathy.
"Well-a-well, wind changes often at night. Time enough before
morning. I'd bet a penny it has changed sin' thou looked."

She looked out of their little window at a weather-cock, near,
glittering in the moonlight; and as she was a sailor's wife, she
instantly recognised the unfavourable point at which the indicator
seemed stationary, and giving a heavy sigh, turned into the room, and
began to beat about in her own mind for some other mode of comfort.

"There's no one else who can prove what you want at the trial
to-morrow, is there?" asked she.

"No one!" answered Mary.

"And you've no clue to the one as is really guilty, if t'other is
not?"

Mary did not answer, but trembled all over.

Sturgis saw it.

"Don't bother her with thy questions," said he to his wife. "She mun
go to bed, for she's all in a shiver with the sea air. I'll see after
the wind, hang it, and the weather-cock, too. Tide will help 'em when
it turns."

Mary went up-stairs murmuring thanks and blessings on those who took
the stranger in. Mrs. Sturgis led her into a little room redolent of
the sea and foreign lands. There was a small bed for one son, bound
for China; and a hammock slung above for another, who was now tossing
in the Baltic. The sheets looked made out of sail-cloth, but were
fresh and clean in spite of their brownness.

Against the wall were wafered two rough drawings of vessels with
their names written underneath, on which the mother's eyes caught,
and gazed until they filled with tears. But she brushed the drops
away with the back of her hand, and in a cheerful tone went on to
assure Mary the bed was well aired.

"I cannot sleep, thank you. I will sit here, if you please," said
Mary, sinking down on the window-seat.

"Come, now," said Mrs. Sturgis, "my master told me to see you to bed,
and I mun. What's the use of watching? A watched pot never boils, and
I see you are after watching that weather-cock. Why now, I try never
to look at it, else I could do nought else. My heart many a time goes
sick when the wind rises, but I turn away and work away, and try
never to think on the wind, but on what I ha' getten to do."

"Let me stay up a little," pleaded Mary, as her hostess seemed so
resolute about seeing her to bed. Her looks won her suit.

"Well, I suppose I mun. I shall catch it down stairs, I know. He'll
be in a fidget till you're getten to bed, I know; so you mun be quiet
if you are so bent upon staying up."

And quietly, noiselessly, Mary watched the unchanging weather-cock
through the night. She sat on the little window-seat, her hand
holding back the curtain which shaded the room from the bright
moonlight without; her head resting its weariness against the corner
of the window-frame; her eyes burning and stiff with the intensity of
her gaze.

The ruddy morning stole up the horizon, casting a crimson glow into
the watcher's room.

It was the morning of the day of trial!




CHAPTER XXXII.

THE TRIAL AND VERDICT--"NOT GUILTY."


            "Thou stand'st here arraign'd,
   That, with presumption impious and accursed,
   Thou hast usurp'd God's high prerogative,
   Making thy fellow mortal's life and death
   Wait on thy moody and diseased passions;
   That with a violent and untimely steel
   Hast set abroach the blood that should have ebbed
   In calm and natural current: to sum all
   In one wild name--a name the pale air freezes at,
   And every cheek of man sinks in with horror--
   Thou art a cold and midnight murderer."

   MILMAN'S "FAZIO."


Of all the restless people who found that night's hours agonising
from excess of anxiety, the poor father of the murdered man was
perhaps the most restless. He had slept but little since the blow had
fallen; his waking hours had been too full of agitated thought, which
seemed to haunt and pursue him through his unquiet slumbers.

And this night of all others was the most sleepless. He turned over
and over again in his mind the wonder if every thing had been done
that could be done, to insure the conviction of Jem Wilson. He almost
regretted the haste with which he had urged forward the proceedings,
and yet until he had obtained vengeance, he felt as if there was no
peace on earth for him (I don't know that he exactly used the term
vengeance in his thoughts; he spoke of justice, and probably thought
of his desired end as such); no peace either bodily or mental, for
he moved up and down his bedroom with the restless incessant tramp
of a wild beast in a cage, and if he compelled his aching limbs to
cease for an instant, the twitchings which ensued almost amounted to
convulsions, and he re-commenced his walk as the lesser evil, and the
more bearable fatigue.

With daylight increased power of action came; and he drove off to
arouse his attorney, and worry him with further directions and
inquiries; and when that was ended, he sat, watch in hand, until the
courts should be opened, and the trial begin.

What were all the living,--wife or daughters,--what were they in
comparison with the dead,--the murdered son who lay unburied still,
in compliance with his father's earnest wish, and almost vowed
purpose of having the slayer of his child sentenced to death, before
he committed the body to the rest of the grave?

At nine o'clock they all met at their awful place of _rendezvous_.

The judge, the jury, the avenger of blood, the prisoner, the
witnesses--all were gathered together within one building. And
besides these were many others, personally interested in some part
of the proceedings, in which, however, they took no part; Job Legh,
Ben Sturgis, and several others were there, amongst whom was Charley
Jones.

Job Legh had carefully avoided any questioning from Mrs. Wilson that
morning. Indeed he had not been much in her company, for he had risen
up early to go out once more to make inquiry for Mary; and when
he could hear nothing of her, he had desperately resolved not to
undeceive Mrs. Wilson, as sorrow never came too late; and if the blow
were inevitable, it would be better to leave her in ignorance of
the impending evil as long as possible. She took her place in the
witness-room, worn and dispirited, but not anxious.

As Job struggled through the crowd into the body of the court, Mr.
Bridgenorth's clerk beckoned to him.

"Here's a letter for you from our client!"

Job sickened as he took it. He did not know why, but he dreaded a
confession of guilt, which would be an overthrow of all hope.

The letter ran as follows.


   DEAR FRIEND,--I thank you heartily for your goodness in
   finding me a lawyer, but lawyers can do no good to me,
   whatever they may do to other people. But I am not the
   less obliged to you, dear friend. I foresee things will go
   against me--and no wonder. If I was a jury-man, I should
   say the man was guilty as had as much evidence brought
   against him as may be brought against me to-morrow. So
   it's no blame to them if they do. But, Job Legh, I think I
   need not tell you I am as guiltless in this matter as the
   babe unborn, although it is not in my power to prove it.
   If I did not believe that you thought me innocent, I could
   not write as I do now to tell you my wishes. You'll not
   forget they are the wishes of a man shortly to die. Dear
   friend, you must take care of my mother. Not in the money
   way, for she will have enough for her and Aunt Alice; but
   you must let her talk to you of me; and show her that
   (whatever others may do) you think I died innocent. I
   don't reckon she will stay long behind when we are all
   gone. Be tender with her, Job, for my sake; and if she
   is a bit fractious at times, remember what she has gone
   through. I know mother will never doubt me, God bless her.

   There is one other whom I fear I have loved too dearly;
   and yet, the loving her has made the happiness of my life.
   She will think I have murdered her lover; she will think
   I have caused the grief she must be feeling. And she must
   go on thinking so. It is hard upon me to say this; but she
   _must_. It will be best for her, and that's all I ought
   to think on. But, dear Job, you are a hearty fellow for
   your time of life, and may live a many years to come; and
   perhaps you could tell her, when you felt sure you were
   drawing near your end, that I solemnly told you (as I do
   now) that I was innocent of this thing. You must not tell
   her for many years to come; but I cannot well bear to
   think on her living through a long life, and hating the
   thought of me as the murderer of him she loved, and dying
   with that hatred to me in her heart. It would hurt me sore
   in the other world to see the look of it in her face, as
   it would be, till she was told. I must not let myself
   think on how she must be viewing me now. So God bless you,
   Job Legh; and no more from

   Yours to command,

   JAMES WILSON.


Job turned the letter over and over when he had read it; sighed
deeply; and then wrapping it carefully up in a bit of newspaper he
had about him, he put it in his waistcoat pocket, and went off to
the door of the witness-room to ask if Mary Barton were there.

As the door opened he saw her sitting within, against a table on
which her folded arms were resting, and her head was hidden within
them. It was an attitude of hopelessness, and would have served to
strike Job dumb in sickness of heart, even without the sound of Mrs.
Wilson's voice in passionate sobbing, and sore lamentations, which
told him as well as words could do (for she was not within view of
the door, and he did not care to go in), that she was at any rate
partially undeceived as to the hopes he had given her last night.

Sorrowfully did Job return into the body of the court; neither Mrs.
Wilson nor Mary having seen him as he had stood at the witness-room
door.

As soon as he could bring his distracted thoughts to bear upon the
present scene, he perceived that the trial of James Wilson for the
murder of Henry Carson was just commencing. The clerk was gabbling
over the indictment, and in a minute or two there was the accustomed
question, "How say you, Guilty, or Not Guilty?"

Although but one answer was expected,--was customary in all
cases,--there was a pause of dead silence, an interval of solemnity
even in this hackneyed part of the proceeding; while the prisoner at
the bar stood with compressed lips, looking at the judge with his
outward eyes, but with far other and different scenes presented
to his mental vision;--a sort of rapid recapitulation of his
life,--remembrances of his childhood,--his father (so proud of him,
his first-born child),--his sweet little playfellow, Mary,--his
hopes, his love,--his despair, yet still, yet ever and ever, his
love,--the blank, wide world it had been without her love,--his
mother,--his childless mother,--but not long to be so,--not long to
be away from all she loved,--nor during that time to be oppressed
with doubt as to his innocence, sure and secure of her darling's
heart;--he started from his instant's pause, and said in a low firm
voice,

"Not guilty, my lord."

The circumstances of the murder, the discovery of the body, the
causes of suspicion against Jem, were as well known to most of
the audience as they are to you, so there was some little buzz of
conversation going on among the people while the leading counsel for
the prosecution made his very effective speech.

"That's Mr. Carson, the father, sitting behind Serjeant Wilkinson!"

"What a noble-looking old man he is! so stern and inflexible, with
such classical features! Does he not remind you of some of the busts
of Jupiter?"

"I am more interested by watching the prisoner. Criminals always
interest me. I try to trace in the features common to humanity some
expression of the crimes by which they have distinguished themselves
from their kind. I have seen a good number of murderers in my day,
but I have seldom seen one with such marks of Cain on his countenance
as the man at the bar."

"Well, I am no physiognomist, but I don't think his face strikes me
as bad. It certainly is gloomy and depressed, and not unnaturally so,
considering his situation."

"Only look at his low, resolute brow, his downcast eye, his white
compressed lips. He never looks up,--just watch him."

"His forehead is not so low if he had that mass of black hair
removed, and is very square, which some people say is a good sign.
If others are to be influenced by such trifles as you are, it would
have been much better if the prison barber had cut his hair a little
previous to the trial; and as for down-cast eye, and compressed lip,
it is all part and parcel of his inward agitation just now; nothing
to do with character, my good fellow."

Poor Jem! His raven hair (his mother's pride, and so often fondly
caressed by her fingers), was that too to have its influence against
him?

The witnesses were called. At first they consisted principally of
policemen; who, being much accustomed to giving evidence, knew what
were the material points they were called on to prove, and did not
lose the time of the court in listening to any thing unnecessary.

"Clear as day against the prisoner," whispered one attorney's clerk
to another.

"Black as night, you mean," replied his friend; and they both smiled.

"Jane Wilson! who's she? some relation, I suppose, from the name."

"The mother,--she that is to prove the gun part of the case."

"Oh, ay--I remember! Rather hard on her, too, I think."

Then both were silent, as one of the officers of the court ushered
Mrs. Wilson into the witness-box. I have often called her "the old
woman," and "an old woman," because, in truth, her appearance was
so much beyond her years, which might not be many above fifty. But
partly owing to her accident in early life, which left a stamp of
pain upon her face, partly owing to her anxious temper, partly to
her sorrows, and partly to her limping gait, she always gave me the
idea of age. But now she might have seemed more than seventy; her
lines were so set and deep, her features so sharpened, and her walk
so feeble. She was trying to check her sobs into composure, and
(unconsciously) was striving to behave as she thought would best
please her poor boy, whom she knew she had often grieved by her
uncontrolled impatience. He had buried his face in his arms, which
rested on the front of the dock (an attitude he retained during the
greater part of his trial, and which prejudiced many against him).

The counsel began the examination.

"Your name is Jane Wilson, I believe."

"Yes, sir."

"The mother of the prisoner at the bar?"

"Yes, sir;" with quivering voice, ready to break out into weeping,
but earning respect by the strong effort at self-control, prompted,
as I have said before, by her earnest wish to please her son by her
behaviour.

The barrister now proceeded to the important part of the examination,
tending to prove that the gun found on the scene of the murder was
the prisoner's. She had committed herself so fully to the policeman,
that she could not well retract; so without much delay in bringing
the question round to the desired point, the gun was produced in
court, and the inquiry made--

"That gun belongs to your son, does it not?"

She clenched the sides of the witness-box in her efforts to make her
parched tongue utter words. At last she moaned forth,

"Oh! Jem, Jem! what mun I say?"

Every one bent forward to hear the prisoner's answer; although, in
fact, it was of little importance to the issue of the trial. He
lifted up his head; and with a face brimming full of pity for his
mother, yet resolved into endurance, said,

"Tell the truth, mother!"

And so she did, with the fidelity of a little child. Every one felt
that she did; and the little colloquy between mother and son did them
some slight service in the opinion of the audience. But the awful
judge sat unmoved; and the jurymen changed not a muscle of their
countenances; while the counsel for the prosecution went triumphantly
through this part of the case, including the fact of Jem's absence
from home on the night of the murder, and bringing every admission to
bear right against the prisoner.

It was over. She was told to go down. But she could no longer compel
her mother's heart to keep silence, and suddenly turning towards
the judge (with whom she imagined the verdict to rest), she thus
addressed him with her choking voice.

"And now, sir, I've telled you the truth, and the whole truth, as
_he_ bid me; but don't ye let what I have said go for to hang him;
oh, my lord judge, take my word for it, he's as innocent as the
child as has yet to be born. For sure, I, who am his mother, and
have nursed him on my knee, and been gladdened by the sight of him
every day since, ought to know him better than yon pack of fellows"
(indicating the jury, while she strove against her heart to render
her words distinct and clear for her dear son's sake) "who, I'll go
bail, never saw him before this morning in all their born days. My
lord judge, he's so good I often wondered what harm there was in him;
many is the time when I've been fretted (for I'm frabbit enough at
times), when I've scold't myself, and said, 'You ungrateful thing,
the Lord God has given you Jem, and isn't that blessing enough for
you?' But He has seen fit to punish me. If Jem is--if Jem is--taken
from me, I shall be a childless woman; and very poor, having nought
left to love on earth, and I cannot say 'His will be done.' I cannot,
my lord judge, oh, I cannot."

While sobbing out these words she was led away by the officers of the
court, but tenderly, and reverently, with the respect which great
sorrow commands.

The stream of evidence went on and on, gathering fresh force from
every witness who was examined, and threatening to overwhelm poor
Jem. Already they had proved that the gun was his, that he had been
heard not many days before the commission of the deed to threaten the
deceased; indeed, that the police had, at that time, been obliged to
interfere to prevent some probable act of violence. It only remained
to bring forward a sufficient motive for the threat and the murder.
The clue to this had been furnished by the policeman, who had
overheard Jem's angry language to Mr. Carson; and his report in the
first instance had occasioned the subpoena to Mary.

And now she was to be called on to bear witness. The court was by
this time almost as full as it could hold; but fresh attempts were
being made to squeeze in at all the entrances, for many were anxious
to see and hear this part of the trial.

Old Mr. Carson felt an additional beat at his heart at the thought of
seeing the fatal Helen, the cause of all--a kind of interest and yet
repugnance, for was not she beloved by the dead; nay, perhaps in her
way, loving and mourning for the same being that he himself was so
bitterly grieving over? And yet he felt as if he abhorred her and her
rumoured loveliness, as if she were the curse against him; and he
grew jealous of the love with which she had inspired his son, and
would fain have deprived her of even her natural right of sorrowing
over her lover's untimely end: for you see it was a fixed idea
in the minds of all, that the handsome, bright, gay, rich young
gentleman must have been beloved in preference to the serious, almost
stern-looking smith, who had to toil for his daily bread.

Hitherto the effect of the trial had equalled Mr. Carson's most
sanguine hopes, and a severe look of satisfaction came over the face
of the avenger,--over that countenance whence the smile had departed,
never more to return.

All eyes were directed to the door through which the witnesses
entered. Even Jem looked up to catch one glimpse before he hid his
face from her look of aversion. The officer had gone to fetch her.

She was in exactly the same attitude as when Job Legh had seen her
two hours before through the half-open door. Not a finger had moved.
The officer summoned her, but she did not stir. She was so still he
thought she had fallen asleep, and he stepped forward and touched
her. She started up in an instant, and followed him with a kind of
rushing rapid motion into the court, into the witness-box.

And amid all that sea of faces, misty and swimming before her eyes,
she saw but two clear bright spots, distinct and fixed: the judge,
who might have to condemn; and the prisoner, who might have to die.

The mellow sunlight streamed down that high window on her head, and
fell on the rich treasure of her golden hair, stuffed away in masses
under her little bonnet-cap; and in those warm beams the motes kept
dancing up and down. The wind had changed--had changed almost as
soon as she had given up her watching; the wind had changed, and she
heeded it not.

Many who were looking for mere flesh and blood beauty, mere
colouring, were disappointed; for her face was deadly white, and
almost set in its expression, while a mournful bewildered soul
looked out of the depths of those soft, deep, gray eyes. But others
recognised a higher and stranger kind of beauty; one that would keep
its hold on the memory for many after years.

I was not there myself; but one who was, told me that her look, and
indeed her whole face, was more like the well-known engraving from
Guido's picture of "Beatrice Cenci" than any thing else he could give
me an idea of. He added, that her countenance haunted him, like the
remembrance of some wild sad melody, heard in childhood; that it
would perpetually recur with its mute imploring agony.

With all the court reeling before her (always save and except those
awful two), she heard a voice speak, and answered the simple inquiry
(something about her name) mechanically, as if in a dream. So she
went on for two or three more questions, with a strange wonder in her
brain, as to the reality of the terrible circumstances in which she
was placed.

Suddenly she was roused, she knew not how or by what. She was
conscious that all was real, that hundreds were looking at her, that
true-sounding words were being extracted from her; that that figure,
so bowed down, with the face concealed by both hands, was really Jem.
Her face flushed scarlet, and then paler than before. But in her
dread of herself, with the tremendous secret imprisoned within her,
she exerted every power she had to keep in the full understanding of
what was going on, of what she was asked, and of what she answered.
With all her faculties preternaturally alive and sensitive, she heard
the next question from the pert young barrister, who was delighted to
have the examination of this witness.

"And pray, may I ask, which was the favoured lover? You say you knew
both these young men. Which was the favoured lover? Which did you
prefer?"

And who was he, the questioner, that he should dare so lightly to
ask of her heart's secrets? That he should dare to ask her to tell,
before that multitude assembled there, what woman usually whispers
with blushes and tears, and many hesitations, to one ear alone?

So, for an instant, a look of indignation contracted Mary's brow,
as she steadily met the eyes of the impertinent counsellor. But, in
that instant, she saw the hands removed from a face beyond, behind;
and a countenance revealed of such intense love and woe,--such a
deprecating dread of her answer; and suddenly her resolution was
taken. The present was everything; the future, that vast shroud, it
was maddening to think upon; but _now_ she might own her fault, but
_now_ she might even own her love. Now, when the beloved stood thus,
abhorred of men, there would be no feminine shame to stand between
her and her avowal. So she also turned towards the judge, partly
to mark that her answer was not given to the monkeyfied man who
questioned her, and likewise that her face might be averted from, and
her eyes not gaze upon, the form that contracted with the dread of
the words he anticipated.

"He asks me which of them two I liked the best. Perhaps I liked Mr.
Harry Carson once--I don't know--I've forgotten; but I loved James
Wilson, that's now on trial, above what tongue can tell--above all
else on earth put together; and I love him now better than ever,
though he has never known a word of it till this minute. For you see,
sir, mother died before I was thirteen, before I could know right
from wrong about some things; and I was giddy and vain, and ready to
listen to any praise of my good looks; and this poor young Mr. Carson
fell in with me, and told me he loved me; and I was foolish enough
to think he meant me marriage: a mother is a pitiful loss to a girl,
sir; and so I used to fancy I could like to be a lady, and rich,
and never know want any more. I never found out how dearly I loved
another till one day, when James Wilson asked me to marry him, and
I was very hard and sharp in my answer (for indeed, sir, I'd a deal
to bear just then), and he took me at my word and left me; and from
that day to this I've never spoken a word to him, or set eyes on him;
though I'd fain have done so, to try and show him we had both been
too hasty; for he'd not been gone out of my sight above a minute
before I knew I loved--far above my life," said she, dropping her
voice as she came to this second confession of the strength of her
attachment. "But, if the gentleman asks me which I loved the best,
I make answer, I was flattered by Mr. Carson, and pleased with his
flattery; but James Wilson I--"

She covered her face with her hands, to hide the burning scarlet
blushes, which even dyed her fingers.

There was a little pause; still, though her speech might inspire pity
for the prisoner, it only strengthened the supposition of his guilt.
Presently the counsellor went on with his examination.

"But you have seen young Mr. Carson since your rejection of the
prisoner?"

"Yes, often."

"You have spoken to him, I conclude, at these times."

"Only once to call speaking."

"And what was the substance of your conversation? Did you tell him
you found you preferred his rival?"

"No, sir. I don't think as I've done wrong in saying, now as things
stand, what my feelings are; but I never would be so bold as to tell
one young man I cared for another. I never named Jem's name to Mr.
Carson. Never."

"Then what did you say when you had this final conversation with Mr.
Carson? You can give me the substance of it, if you don't remember
the words."

"I'll try, sir; but I'm not very clear. I told him I could not love
him, and wished to have nothing more to do with him. He did his best
to over-persuade me, but I kept steady, and at last I ran off."

"And you never spoke to him again?"

"Never!"

"Now, young woman, remember you are upon your oath. Did you ever tell
the prisoner at the bar of Mr. Henry Carson's attentions to you? of
your acquaintance, in short? Did you ever try to excite his jealousy
by boasting of a lover so far above you in station?"

"Never. I never did," said she, in so firm and distinct a manner as
to leave no doubt.

"Were you aware that he knew of Mr. Henry Carson's regard for you?
Remember you are on your oath!"

"Never, sir. I was not aware until I heard of the quarrel between
them, and what Jem had said to the policeman, and that was after the
murder. To this day I can't make out who told Jem. Oh, sir, may not
I go down?"

For she felt the sense, the composure, the very bodily strength which
she had compelled to her aid for a time, suddenly giving way, and was
conscious that she was losing all command over herself. There was no
occasion to detain her longer; she had done her part. She might go
down. The evidence was still stronger against the prisoner; but now
he stood erect and firm, with self-respect in his attitude, and a
look of determination on his face, which almost made it appear noble.
Yet he seemed lost in thought.

Job Legh had all this time been trying to soothe and comfort Mrs.
Wilson, who would first be in the court, in order to see her darling,
and then, when her sobs became irrepressible, had to be led out into
the open air, and sat there weeping, on the steps of the court-house.
Who would have taken charge of Mary on her release from the
witness-box I do not know, if Mrs. Sturgis, the boatman's wife, had
not been there, brought by her interest in Mary, towards whom she now
pressed, in order to urge her to leave the scene of the trial.

"No! no!" said Mary, to this proposition. "I must be here, I must
watch that they don't hang him, you know I must."

"Oh! they'll not hang him! never fear! Besides the wind has changed,
and that's in his favour. Come away. You're so hot, and first white
and then red; I'm sure you're ill. Just come away."

"Oh! I don't know about any thing but that I must stay," replied
Mary, in a strange hurried manner, catching hold of some rails as if
she feared some bodily force would be employed to remove her. So Mrs.
Sturgis just waited patiently by her, every now and then peeping
among the congregation of heads in the body of the court, to see if
her husband were still there. And there he always was to be seen,
looking and listening with all his might. His wife felt easy that he
would not be wanting her at home until the trial was ended.

Mary never let go her clutched hold on the rails. She wanted them to
steady her, in that heaving, whirling court. She thought the feeling
of something hard compressed within her hand would help her to
listen, for it was such pain, such weary pain in her head, to strive
to attend to what was being said. They were all at sea, sailing away
on billowy waves, and every one speaking at once, and no one heeding
her father, who was calling on them to be silent, and listen to him.
Then again, for a brief second, the court stood still, and she could
see the judge, sitting up there like an idol, with his trappings, so
rigid and stiff; and Jem, opposite, looking at her, as if to say, Am
I to die for what you know your ----. Then she checked herself, and
by a great struggle brought herself round to an instant's sanity.
But the round of thought never stood still; and off she went again;
and every time her power of struggling against the growing delirium
grew fainter and fainter. She muttered low to herself, but no one
heard her except her neighbour, Mrs. Sturgis; all were too closely
attending to the case for the prosecution, which was now being wound
up.

The counsel for the prisoner had avoided much cross-examination,
reserving to himself the right of calling the witnesses forward
again; for he had received so little, and such vague instructions,
and understood that so much depended on the evidence of one who was
not forthcoming, that in fact he had little hope of establishing any
thing like a show of a defence, and contented himself with watching
the case, and lying in wait for any legal objections that might
offer themselves. He lay back on the seat, occasionally taking a
pinch of snuff in a manner intended to be contemptuous; now and then
elevating his eyebrows, and sometimes exchanging a little note with
Mr. Bridgenorth behind him. The attorney had far more interest in the
case than the barrister, to which he was perhaps excited by his poor
old friend Job Legh; who had edged and wedged himself through the
crowd close to Mr. Bridgenorth's elbow, sent thither by Ben Sturgis,
to whom he had been "introduced" by Charley Jones, and who had
accounted for Mary's disappearance on the preceding day, and spoken
of their chase, their fears, their hopes.

All this was told in a few words to Mr. Bridgenorth--so few, that
they gave him but a confused idea, that time was of value; and this
he named to his counsel, who now rose to speak for the defence.

Job Legh looked about for Mary, now he had gained, and given, some
idea of the position of things. At last he saw her, standing by a
decent-looking woman, looking flushed and anxious, and moving her
lips incessantly, as if eagerly talking; her eyes never resting on
any object, but wandering about as if in search of something. Job
thought it was for him she was seeking, and he struggled to get round
to her. When he had succeeded, she took no notice of him, although
he spoke to her, but still kept looking round and round in the same
wild, restless manner. He tried to hear the low quick mutterings of
her voice, as he caught the repetition of the same words over and
over again.

"I must not go mad. I must not, indeed. They say people tell the
truth when they're mad; but I don't. I was always a liar. I was,
indeed; but I'm not mad. I must not go mad. I must not, indeed."

Suddenly she seemed to become aware how earnestly Job was listening
(with mournful attention) to her words, and turning sharp round upon
him, with upbraiding for his eaves-dropping on her lips, she caught
sight of something,--or some one,--who, even in that state, had power
to arrest her attention, and throwing up her arms with wild energy,
she shrieked aloud,

"Oh, Jem! Jem! you're saved; and I _am_ mad--" and was instantly
seized with convulsions. With much commiseration she was taken out
of court, while the attention of many was diverted from her, by the
fierce energy with which a sailor forced his way over rails and
seats, against turnkeys and policemen. The officers of the court
opposed this forcible manner of entrance, but they could hardly
induce the offender to adopt any quieter way of attaining his object,
and telling his tale in the witness-box, the legitimate place. For
Will had dwelt so impatiently on the danger in which his absence
would place his cousin, that even yet he seemed to fear that he might
see the prisoner carried off, and hung, before he could pour out the
narrative which would exculpate him. As for Job Legh, his feelings
were all but uncontrollable; as you may judge by the indifference
with which he saw Mary borne, stiff and convulsed, out of the court,
in the charge of the kind Mrs. Sturgis, who, you will remember, was
an utter stranger to him.

"She'll keep! I'll not trouble myself about her," said he to himself,
as he wrote with trembling hands a little note of information to Mr.
Bridgenorth, who had conjectured, when Will had first disturbed the
awful tranquillity of the life-and-death court, that the witness had
arrived (better late than never) on whose evidence rested all the
slight chance yet remaining to Jem Wilson of escaping death. During
the commotion in the court, among all the cries and commands, the
dismay and the directions, consequent upon Will's entrance, and
poor Mary's fearful attack of illness, Mr. Bridgenorth had kept his
lawyer-like presence of mind; and long before Job Legh's almost
illegible note was poked at him, he had recapitulated the facts on
which Will had to give evidence, and the manner in which he had been
pursued, after his ship had taken her leave of the land.

The barrister who defended Jem took new heart when he was put in
possession of these striking points to be adduced, not so much out
of earnestness to save the prisoner, of whose innocence he was still
doubtful, as because he saw the opportunities for the display of
forensic eloquence which were presented by the facts; "a gallant tar
brought back from the pathless ocean by a girl's noble daring," "the
dangers of too hastily judging from circumstantial evidence," &c.,
&c.; while the counsellor for the prosecution prepared himself by
folding his arms, elevating his eyebrows, and putting his lips in the
form in which they might best whistle down the wind such evidence
as might be produced by a suborned witness, who dared to perjure
himself. For, of course, it is etiquette to suppose that such
evidence as may be given against the opinion which lawyers are
paid to uphold, is any thing but based on truth; and "perjury,"
"conspiracy," and "peril of your immortal soul," are light
expressions to throw at the heads of those who may prove (not the
speaker, there would then be some excuse for the hasty words of
personal anger, but) the hirer of the speaker to be wrong, or
mistaken.

But when once Will had attained his end, and felt that his tale,
or part of a tale, would be heard by judge and jury; when once he
saw Jem standing safe and well before him (even though he saw him
pale and care-worn at the felon's bar); his courage took the shape
of presence of mind, and he awaited the examination with a calm,
unflinching intelligence, which dictated the clearest and most
pertinent answers. He told the story you know so well: how his
leave of absence being nearly expired, he had resolved to fulfil
his promise, and go to see an uncle residing in the Isle of Man;
how his money (sailor-like) was all expended in Manchester, and how,
consequently, it had been necessary for him to walk to Liverpool,
which he had accordingly done on the very night of the murder,
accompanied as far as Hollins Greeb by his friend and cousin, the
prisoner at the bar. He was clear and distinct in every corroborative
circumstance, and gave a short account of the singular way in which
he had been recalled from his outward-bound voyage, and the terrible
anxiety he had felt, as the pilot-boat had struggled home against
the wind. The jury felt that their opinion (so nearly decided half
an hour ago) was shaken and disturbed in a very uncomfortable and
perplexing way, and were almost grateful to the counsel for the
prosecution, when he got up, with a brow of thunder, to demolish
the evidence, which was so bewildering when taken in connexion with
every thing previously adduced. But if such, without looking to the
consequences, was the first impulsive feeling of some among the jury,
how shall I describe the vehemence of passion which possessed the
mind of poor Mr. Carson, as he saw the effect of the young sailor's
statement? It never shook his belief in Jem's guilt in the least,
that attempt at an alibi; his hatred, his longing for vengeance,
having once defined an object to itself, could no more bear to be
frustrated and disappointed than the beast of prey can submit to have
his victim taken from his hungry jaws. No more likeness to the calm
stern power of Jupiter was there in that white eager face, almost
distorted by its fell anxiety of expression.

The counsel to whom etiquette assigned the cross-examination of Will,
caught the look on Mr. Carson's face, and in his desire to further
the intense wish there manifested, he over-shot his mark even in his
first insulting question:

"And now, my man, you've told the court a very good and very
convincing story; no reasonable man ought to doubt the unstained
innocence of your relation at the bar. Still there is one
circumstance you have forgotten to name; and I feel that without
it your evidence is rather incomplete. Will you have the kindness
to inform the gentlemen of the jury what has been your charge for
repeating this very plausible story? How much good coin of Her
Majesty's realm have you received, or are you to receive, for walking
up from the docks, or some less creditable place, and uttering the
tale you have just now repeated,--very much to the credit of your
instructor, I must say? Remember, sir, you are upon oath."

It took Will a minute to extract the meaning from the garb of
unaccustomed words in which it was invested, and during this time he
looked a little confused. But the instant the truth flashed upon him,
he fixed his bright clear eyes, flaming with indignation, upon the
counsellor, whose look fell at last before that stern unflinching
gaze. Then, and not till then, Will made answer.

"Will you tell the judge and jury how much money you've been paid for
your impudence towards one who has told God's blessed truth, and who
would scorn to tell a lie, or blackguard any one, for the biggest fee
as ever lawyer got for doing dirty work? Will you tell, sir?-- But
I'm ready, my lord judge, to take my oath as many times as your
lordship or the jury would like, to testify to things having happened
just as I said. There's O'Brien, the pilot, in court now. Would
somebody with a wig on please to ask him how much he can say for me?"

It was a good idea, and caught at by the counsel for the defence.
O'Brien gave just such testimony as was required to clear Will
from all suspicion. He had witnessed the pursuit, he had heard the
conversation which took place between the boat and the ship; he had
given Will a homeward passage in his boat. And the character of an
accredited pilot, appointed by Trinity House, was known to be above
suspicion.

Mr. Carson sank back on his seat in sickening despair. He knew enough
of courts to be aware of the extreme unwillingness of juries to
convict, even where the evidence is most clear, when the penalty
of such conviction is death. At the period of the trial most
condemnatory to the prisoner, he had repeated this fact to himself
in order to damp his too certain expectation of a conviction. Now it
needed not repetition, for it forced itself upon his consciousness,
and he seemed to _know_, even before the jury retired to consult,
that by some trick, some negligence, some miserable hocus-pocus,
the murderer of his child, his darling, his Absalom, who had never
rebelled,--the slayer of his unburied boy would slip through the
fangs of justice, and walk free and unscathed over that earth where
his son would never more be seen.

It was even so. The prisoner hid his face once more to shield the
expression of an emotion he could not control, from the notice of the
over-curious; Job Legh ceased his eager talking to Mr. Bridgenorth;
Charley looked grave and earnest; for the jury filed one by one back
into their box, and the question was asked to which such an awful
answer might be given.

The verdict they had come to was unsatisfactory to themselves at
last; neither being convinced of his innocence, nor yet quite willing
to believe him guilty in the teeth of the alibi. But the punishment
that awaited him, if guilty, was so terrible, and so unnatural a
sentence for man to pronounce on man, that the knowledge of it had
weighed down the scale on the side of innocence, and "Not Guilty" was
the verdict that thrilled through the breathless court.

One moment of silence, and then the murmurs rose, as the verdict was
discussed by all with lowered voice. Jem stood motionless, his head
bowed; poor fellow, he was stunned with the rapid career of events
during the last few hours.

He had assumed his place at the bar with little or no expectation
of an acquittal; and with scarcely any desire for life, in the
complication of occurrences tending to strengthen the idea of Mary's
more than indifference to him; she had loved another, and in her mind
Jem believed that he himself must be regarded as the murderer of him
she loved. And suddenly, athwart this gloom which made life seem such
a blank expanse of desolation, there flashed the exquisite delight
of hearing Mary's avowal of love, making the future all glorious, if
a future in this world he might hope to have. He could not dwell on
any thing but her words, telling of her passionate love; all else was
indistinct, nor could he strive to make it otherwise. She loved him.

And Life, now full of tender images, suddenly bright with all
exquisite promises, hung on a breath, the slenderest gossamer chance.
He tried to think that the knowledge of her love would soothe him
even in his dying hours; but the phantoms of what life with her
might be, would obtrude, and made him almost gasp and reel under the
uncertainty he was enduring. Will's appearance had only added to the
intensity of this suspense.

The full meaning of the verdict could not at once penetrate his
brain. He stood dizzy and motionless. Some one pulled his coat. He
turned, and saw Job Legh, the tears stealing down his brown furrowed
cheeks, while he tried in vain to command voice enough to speak. He
kept shaking Jem by the hand as the best and necessary expression of
his feeling.

"Here! make yourself scarce! I should think you'd be glad to get
out of that!" exclaimed the gaoler, as he brought up another livid
prisoner, from out whose eyes came the anxiety which he would not
allow any other feature to display.

Job Legh pressed out of court, and Jem followed unreasoningly.

The crowd made way, and kept their garments tight about them, as Jem
passed, for about him there still hung the taint of the murderer.

He was in the open air, and free once more! Although many looked on
him with suspicion, faithful friends closed round him; his arm was
unresistingly pumped up and down by his cousin and Job; when one
was tired, the other took up the wholesome exercise, while Ben
Sturgis was working off his interest in the scene by scolding Charley
for walking on his head round and round Mary's sweetheart, for a
sweetheart he was now satisfactorily ascertained to be, in spite of
her assertion to the contrary. And all this time Jem himself felt
bewildered and dazzled; he would have given any thing for an hour's
uninterrupted thought on the occurrences of the past week, and the
new visions raised up during the morning; aye, even though that
tranquil hour were to be passed in the hermitage of his quiet prison
cell. The first question sobbed out by his choking voice, oppressed
with emotion, was,

"Where is she?"

They led him to the room where his mother sat. They had told her
of her son's acquittal, and now she was laughing, and crying,
and talking, and giving way to all those feelings which she had
restrained with such effort during the last few days. They brought
her son to her, and she threw herself upon his neck, weeping there.
He returned her embrace, but looked around, beyond. Excepting his
mother there was no one in the room but the friends who had entered
with him.

"Eh, lad!" said she, when she found voice to speak. "See what it is
to have behaved thysel! I could put in a good word for thee, and the
jury could na go and hang thee in the face of th' character I gave
thee. Was na it a good thing they did na keep me from Liverpool? But
I would come; I knew I could do thee good, bless thee, my lad. But
thou'rt very white, and all of a tremble."

He kissed her again and again, but looking round as if searching for
some one he could not find, the first words he uttered were still,

"Where is she?"




CHAPTER XXXIII.

REQUIESCAT IN PACE.


   "Fear no more the heat o' th' sun,
     Nor the furious winter's rages;
   Thou thy worldly task hast done,
     Home art gone and ta'en thy wages."

   CYMBELINE.

   "While day and night can bring delight,
     Or nature aught of pleasure give;
   While joys above my mind can move
     For thee, and thee alone I live:

   "When that grim foe of joy below
     Comes in between to make us part,
   The iron hand that breaks our band,
     It breaks my bliss--it breaks my heart."

   BURNS.


She was where no words of peace, no soothing hopeful tidings could
reach her; in the ghastly spectral world of delirium. Hour after
hour, day after day, she started up with passionate cries on her
father to save Jem; or rose wildly, imploring the winds and waves,
the pitiless winds and waves, to have mercy; and over and over
again she exhausted her feverish fitful strength in these agonised
entreaties, and fell back powerless, uttering only the wailing moans
of despair. They told her Jem was safe, they brought him before her
eyes; but sight and hearing were no longer channels of information to
that poor distracted brain, nor could human voice penetrate to her
understanding.

Jem alone gathered the full meaning of some of her strange sentences,
and perceived that by some means or other she, like himself, had
divined the truth of her father being the murderer.

Long ago (reckoning time by events and thoughts, and not by clock
or dial-plate), Jem had felt certain that Mary's father was Harry
Carson's murderer; and although the motive was in some measure a
mystery, yet a whole train of circumstances (the principal of which
was that John Barton had borrowed the fatal gun only two days before)
had left no doubt in Jem's mind. Sometimes he thought that John had
discovered, and thus bloodily resented, the attentions which Mr.
Carson had paid to his daughter; at others, he believed the motive to
exist in the bitter feuds between the masters and their work-people,
in which Barton was known to take so keen an interest. But if he had
felt himself pledged to preserve this secret, even when his own life
was the probable penalty, and he believed he should fall, execrated
by Mary as the guilty destroyer of her lover, how much more was he
bound now to labour to prevent any word of hers from inculpating her
father, now that she was his own; now that she had braved so much
to rescue him; and now that her poor brain had lost all guiding and
controlling power over her words.

All that night long Jem wandered up and down the narrow precincts
of Ben Sturgis's house. In the little bed-room where Mrs. Sturgis
alternately tended Mary, and wept over the violence of her illness,
he listened to her ravings; each sentence of which had its own
peculiar meaning and reference, intelligible to his mind, till her
words rose to the wild pitch of agony, that no one could alleviate,
and he could bear it no longer, and stole, sick and miserable down
stairs, where Ben Sturgis thought it his duty to snore away in an
arm-chair instead of his bed, under the idea that he should thus be
more ready for active service, such as fetching the doctor to revisit
his patient.

Before it was fairly light, Jem (wide-awake, and listening with an
earnest attention he could not deaden, however painful its results
proved) heard a gentle subdued knock at the house door; it was no
business of his, to be sure, to open it, but as Ben slept on, he
thought he would see who the early visitor might be, and ascertain
if there was any occasion for disturbing either host or hostess. It
was Job Legh who stood there, distinct against the outer light of the
street.

"How is she? Eh! poor soul! is that her! no need to ask! How strange
her voice sounds! Screech! screech! and she so low, sweet-spoken,
when she's well! Thou must keep up heart, old boy, and not look so
dismal, thysel."

"I can't help it, Job; it's past a man's bearing to hear such a one
as she is, going on as she is doing; even if I did not care for her,
it would cut me sore to see one so young, and--I can't speak of it,
Job, as a man should do," said Jem, his sobs choking him.

"Let me in, will you?" said Job, pushing past him, for all this time
Jem had stood holding the door, unwilling to admit Job where he might
hear so much that would be suggestive to one acquainted with the
parties that Mary named.

"I'd more than one reason for coming betimes. I wanted to hear how
yon poor wench was;--that stood first. Late last night I got a letter
from Margaret, very anxious-like. The doctor says the old lady yonder
can't last many days longer, and it seems so lonesome for her to die
with no one but Margaret and Mrs. Davenport about her. So I thought
I'd just come and stay with Mary Barton, and see as she's well done
to, and you and your mother and Will go and take leave of old Alice."

Jem's countenance, sad at best just now, fell lower and lower. But
Job went on with his speech.

"She still wanders, Margaret says, and thinks she's with her mother
at home; but for all that, she should have some kith and kin near her
to close her eyes, to my thinking."

"Could not you and Will take mother home? I'd follow when--" Jem
faltered out thus far, when Job interrupted,

"Lad! if thou knew what thy mother has suffered for thee, thou'd
not speak of leaving her just when she's got thee from the grave
as it were. Why, this very night she roused me up, and 'Job,' says
she, 'I ask your pardon for wakening you, but tell me, am I awake or
dreaming? Is Jem proved innocent? Oh, Job Legh! God send I've not
been only dreaming it!' For thou see'st she can't rightly understand
why thou'rt with Mary, and not with her. Ay, ay! I know why; but a
mother only gives up her son's heart inch by inch to his wife, and
then she gives it up with a grudge. No, Jem! thou must go with thy
mother just now, if ever thou hopest for God's blessing. She's a
widow, and has none but thee. Never fear for Mary! She's young and
will struggle through. They are decent people, these folk she is
with, and I'll watch o'er her as though she was my own poor girl,
that lies cold enough in London-town. I grant ye, it's hard enough
for her to be left among strangers. To my mind John Barton would
be more in the way of his duty, looking after his daughter, than
delegating it up and down the country, looking after every one's
business but his own."

A new idea and a new fear came into Jem's mind. What if Mary should
implicate her father?

"She raves terribly," said he. "All night long she's been speaking
of her father, and mixing up thoughts of him with the trial she saw
yesterday. I should not wonder if she'll speak of him as being in
court next thing."

"I should na wonder, either," answered Job. "Folk in her way say many
and many a strange thing; and th' best way is never to mind them. Now
you take your mother home, Jem, and stay by her till old Alice is
gone, and trust me for seeing after Mary."

Jem felt how right Job was, and could not resist what he knew to be
his duty, but I cannot tell you how heavy and sick at heart he was
as he stood at the door to take a last fond, lingering look at Mary.
He saw her sitting up in bed, her golden hair, dimmed with her one
day's illness, floating behind her, her head bound round with wetted
cloths, her features all agitated, even to distortion, with the pangs
of her anxiety.

Her lover's eyes filled with tears. He could not hope. The elasticity
of his heart had been crushed out of him by early sorrows; and now,
especially, the dark side of every thing seemed to be presented to
him. What if she died, just when he knew the treasure, the untold
treasure he possessed in her love! What if (worse than death) she
remained a poor gibbering maniac all her life long (and mad people
do live to be old sometimes, even under all the pressure of their
burden), terror-distracted as she was now, and no one able to comfort
her!

"Jem!" said Job, partly guessing the other's feelings by his own.
"Jem!" repeated he, arresting his attention before he spoke. Jem
turned round, the little motion causing the tears to overflow and
trickle down his cheeks. "Thou must trust in God, and leave her in
His hands." He spoke hushed, and low; but the words sank all the more
into Jem's heart, and gave him strength to tear himself away.

He found his mother (notwithstanding that she had but just regained
her child through Mary's instrumentality) half inclined to resent his
having passed the night in anxious devotion to the poor invalid. She
dwelt on the duties of children to their parents (above all others),
till Jem could hardly believe the relative positions they had held
only yesterday, when she was struggling with and controlling every
instinct of her nature, only because _he_ wished it. However, the
recollection of that yesterday, with its hair's breadth between him
and a felon's death, and the love that had lightened the dark shadow,
made him bear with the meekness and patience of a true-hearted man
all the worrying little acerbities of to-day; and he had no small
merit in so doing; for in him, as in his mother, the re-action after
intense excitement had produced its usual effect in increased
irritability of the nervous system.

They found Alice alive, and without pain. And that was all. A child
of a few weeks old would have had more bodily strength; a child of a
very few months old, more consciousness of what was passing before
her. But even in this state she diffused an atmosphere of peace
around her. True, Will, at first, wept passionate tears at the sight
of her, who had been as a mother to him, so standing on the confines
of life. But even now, as always, loud passionate feeling could not
long endure in the calm of her presence. The firm faith which her
mind had no longer power to grasp, had left its trail of glory; for
by no other word can I call the bright happy look which illumined the
old earth-worn face. Her talk, it is true, bore no more that constant
earnest reference to God and His holy Word which it had done in
health, and there were no death-bed words of exhortation from the
lips of one so habitually pious. For still she imagined herself once
again in the happy, happy realms of childhood; and again dwelling
in the lovely northern haunts where she had so often longed to be.
Though earthly sight was gone away, she beheld again the scenes she
had loved from long years ago! she saw them without a change to dim
the old radiant hues. The long dead were with her, fresh and blooming
as in those bygone days. And death came to her as a welcome blessing,
like as evening comes to the weary child. Her work here was finished,
and faithfully done.

What better sentence can an emperor wish to have said over his bier?
In second childhood (that blessing clouded by a name), she said her
"Nunc Dimittis,"--the sweetest canticle to the holy.

"Mother, good night! Dear mother! bless me once more! I'm very tired,
and would fain go to sleep." She never spoke again on this side
Heaven.

She died the day after their return from Liverpool. From that time,
Jem became aware that his mother was jealously watching for some word
or sign which should betoken his wish to return to Mary. And yet go
to Liverpool he must and would, as soon as the funeral was over, if
but for a single glimpse of his darling. For Job had never written;
indeed, any necessity for his so doing had never entered his head.
If Mary died, he would announce it personally; if she recovered, he
meant to bring her home with him. Writing was to him little more than
an auxiliary to natural history; a way of ticketing specimens, not of
expressing thoughts.

The consequence of this want of intelligence as to Mary's state was,
that Jem was constantly anticipating that every person and every
scrap of paper was to convey to him the news of her death. He could
not endure this state long; but he resolved not to disturb the house
by announcing to his mother his purposed intention of returning to
Liverpool, until the dead had been carried forth.

On Sunday afternoon they laid her low with many tears. Will wept as
one who would not be comforted.

The old childish feeling came over him, the feeling of loneliness at
being left among strangers.

By and bye, Margaret timidly stole near him, as if waiting to
console; and soon his passion sank down to grief, and grief gave way
to melancholy, and though he felt as if he never could be joyful
again, he was all the while unconsciously approaching nearer to the
full happiness of calling Margaret his own, and a golden thread was
interwoven even now with the darkness of his sorrow. Yet it was on
his arm that Jane Wilson leant on her return homewards. Jem took
charge of Margaret.

"Margaret, I'm bound for Liverpool by the first train to-morrow; I
must set your grandfather at liberty."

"I'm sure he likes nothing better than watching over poor Mary; he
loves her nearly as well as me. But let me go! I have been so full
of poor Alice, I've never thought of it before; I can't do so much
as many a one, but Mary will like to have a woman about her that she
knows. I'm sorry I waited to be reminded, Jem." replied Margaret,
with some little self-reproach.

But Margaret's proposition did not at all agree with her companion's
wishes. He found he had better speak out, and put his intention at
once to the right motive; the subterfuge about setting Job Legh at
liberty had done him harm instead of good.

"To tell truth, Margaret, it's I that must go, and that for my own
sake, not your grandfather's. I can rest neither by night nor day for
thinking on Mary. Whether she lives or dies I look on her as my wife
before God, as surely and solemnly as if we were married. So being, I
have the greatest right to look after her, and I cannot yield it even
to--"

"Her father," said Margaret, finishing his interrupted sentence. "It
seems strange that a girl like her should be thrown on the bare world
to struggle through so bad an illness. No one seems to know where
John Barton is, else I thought of getting Morris to write him a
letter telling him about Mary. I wish he was home, that I do!"

Jem could not echo this wish.

"Mary's not bad off for friends where she is," said he. "I call them
friends, though a week ago we none of us knew there were such folks
in the world. But being anxious and sorrowful about the same thing
makes people friends quicker than any thing, I think. She's like a
mother to Mary in her ways; and he bears a good character, as far as
I could learn just in that hurry. We're drawing near home, and I've
not said my say, Margaret. I want you to look after mother a bit.
She'll not like my going, and I've got to break it to her yet. If she
takes it very badly, I'll come back to-morrow night; but if she's not
against it very much, I mean to stay till it's settled about Mary,
one way or the other. Will, you know, will be there, Margaret, to
help a bit in doing for mother."

Will's being there made the only objection Margaret saw to this plan.
She disliked the idea of seeming to throw herself in his way; and yet
she did not like to say any thing of this feeling to Jem, who had all
along seemed perfectly unconscious of any love-affair, besides his
own, in progress.

So Margaret gave a reluctant consent.

"If you can just step up to our house to-night, Jem, I'll put up a
few things as may be useful to Mary, and then you can say when you'll
likely be back. If you come home to-morrow night, and Will's there,
perhaps I need not step up?"

"Yes, Margaret, do! I shan't leave easy unless you go some time in
the day to see mother. I'll come to-night, though; and now good-bye.
Stay! do you think you could just coax poor Will to walk a bit home
with you, that I might speak to mother by myself?"

No! that Margaret could not do. That was expecting too great a
sacrifice of bashful feeling.

But the object was accomplished by Will's going up-stairs immediately
on their return to the house, to indulge his mournful thoughts alone.
As soon as Jem and his mother were left by themselves, he began on
the subject uppermost in his mind.

"Mother!"

She put her handkerchief from her eyes, and turned quickly round so
as to face him where he stood, thinking what best to say. The little
action annoyed him, and he rushed at once into the subject.

"Mother! I am going back to Liverpool to-morrow morning to see how
Mary Barton is."

"And what's Mary Barton to thee, that thou shouldst be running after
her in that-a-way?"

"If she lives, she shall be my wedded wife. If she dies--mother, I
can't speak of what I shall feel if she dies." His voice was choked
in his throat.

For an instant his mother was interested by his words; and then came
back the old jealousy of being supplanted in the affections of that
son, who had been, as it were, newly born to her, by the escape he
had so lately experienced from danger. So she hardened her heart
against entertaining any feeling of sympathy; and turned away from
the face, which recalled the earnest look of his childhood, when he
had come to her in some trouble, sure of help and comfort.

And coldly she spoke, in those tones which Jem knew and dreaded, even
before the meaning they expressed was fully shaped. "Thou'rt old
enough to please thysel. Old mothers are cast aside, and what they've
borne forgotten, as soon as a pretty face comes across. I might have
thought of that last Tuesday, when I felt as if thou wert all my own,
and the judge were some wild animal trying to rend thee from me. I
spoke up for thee then; but it's all forgotten now, I suppose."

"Mother! you know all this while, _you know_ I can never forget any
kindness you've ever done for me; and they've been many. Why should
you think I've only room for one love in my heart? I can love you as
dearly as ever, and Mary too, as much as man ever loved woman."

He awaited a reply. None was vouchsafed.

"Mother, answer me!" said he, at last.

"What mun I answer? You asked me no question."

"Well! I ask you this now. To-morrow morning I go to Liverpool to see
her, who is as my wife. Dear mother! will you bless me on my errand?
If it please God she recovers, will you take her to you as you would
a daughter?"

She could neither refuse nor assent.

"Why need you go?" said she querulously, at length. "You'll be
getting in some mischief or another again. Can't you stop at home
quiet with me?"

Jem got up, and walked about the room in despairing impatience. She
would not understand his feelings. At last he stopped right before
the place where she was sitting, with an air of injured meekness on
her face.

"Mother! I often think what a good man father was! I've often heard
you tell of your courting days; and of the accident that befell you,
and how ill you were. How long is it ago?"

"Near upon five-and-twenty years," said she, with a sigh.

"You little thought when you were so ill you should live to have such
a fine strapping son as I am, did you now?"

She smiled a little, and looked up at him, which was just what he
wanted.

"Thou'rt not so fine a man as thy father was, by a deal!" said she,
looking at him with much fondness, notwithstanding her depreciatory
words.

He took another turn or two up and down the room. He wanted to bend
the subject round to his own case.

"Those were happy days when father was alive!"

"You may say so, lad! Such days as will never come again to me, at
any rate." She sighed sorrowfully.

"Mother!" said he at last, stopping short, and taking her hand in
his with tender affection, "you'd like me to be as happy a man as my
father was before me, would not you? You'd like me to have some one
to make me as happy as you made father? Now, would you not, dear
mother?"

"I did not make him as happy as I might ha' done," murmured she, in
a low, sad voice of self-reproach. "Th' accident gave a jar to my
temper it's never got the better of; and now he's gone where he can
never know how I grieve for having frabbed him as I did."

"Nay, mother, we don't know that!" said Jem, with gentle soothing.
"Any how, you and father got along with as few rubs as most people.
But for _his_ sake, dear mother, don't say me nay, now that I come to
you to ask your blessing before setting out to see her, who is to be
my wife, if ever woman is; for _his_ sake, if not for mine, love her
who I shall bring home to be to me all you were to him: and mother! I
do not ask for a truer or a tenderer heart than yours is, in the long
run."

The hard look left her face; though her eyes were still averted
from Jem's gaze, it was more because they were brimming over with
tears, called forth by his words, than because any angry feeling yet
remained. And when his manly voice died away in low pleadings, she
lifted up her hands, and bent down her son's head below the level of
her own; and then she solemnly uttered a blessing.

"God bless thee, Jem, my own dear lad. And may He bless Mary Barton
for thy sake."

Jem's heart leaped up, and from this time hope took the place of fear
in his anticipations with regard to Mary.

"Mother! you show your own true self to Mary, and she'll love you as
dearly as I do."

So with some few smiles, and some few tears, and much earnest
talking, the evening wore away.

"I must be off to see Margaret. Why, it's near ten o'clock! Could you
have thought it? Now don't you stop up for me, mother. You and Will
go to bed, for you've both need of it. I shall be home in an hour."

Margaret had felt the evening long and lonely; and was all but giving
up the thoughts of Jem's coming that night, when she heard his step
at the door.

He told her of his progress with his mother; he told her his hopes,
and was silent on the subject of his fears.

"To think how sorrow and joy are mixed up together. You'll date your
start in life as Mary's acknowledged lover from poor Alice Wilson's
burial day. Well! the dead are soon forgotten!"

"Dear Margaret!--But you're worn out with your long evening waiting
for me. I don't wonder. But never you, nor any one else, think
because God sees fit to call up new interests, perhaps right out
of the grave, that therefore the dead are forgotten. Margaret, you
yourself can remember our looks, and fancy what we're like."

"Yes! but what has that to do with remembering Alice?"

"Why, just this. You're not always trying to think on our faces, and
making a labour of remembering; but often, I'll be bound, when you're
sinking off to sleep, or when you're very quiet and still, the faces
you knew so well when you could see, come smiling before you with
loving looks. Or you remember them, without striving after it, and
without thinking it's your duty to keep recalling them. And so it is
with them that are hidden from our sight. If they've been worthy to
be heartily loved while alive, they'll not be forgotten when dead;
it's against nature. And we need no more be upbraiding ourselves
for letting in God's rays of light upon our sorrow, and no more
be fearful of forgetting them, because their memory is not always
haunting and taking up our minds, than you need to trouble yourself
about remembering your grandfather's face, or what the stars were
like,--you can't forget if you would, what it's such a pleasure to
think about. Don't fear my forgetting Aunt Alice."

"I'm not, Jem; not now, at least; only you seemed so full about
Mary."

"I've kept it down so long, remember. How glad Aunt Alice would have
been to know that I might hope to have her for my wife! that's to
say, if God spares her!"

"She would not have known it, even if you could have told her this
last fortnight,--ever since you went away she's been thinking always
that she was a little child at her mother's apron-string. She must
have been a happy little thing; it was such a pleasure to her to
think about those early days, when she lay old and gray on her
death-bed."

"I never knew any one seem more happy all her life long."

"Ay! and how gentle and easy her death was! She thought her mother
was near her."

They fell into calm thought about those last peaceful happy hours.

It struck eleven. Jem started up.

"I should have been gone long ago. Give me the bundle. You'll not
forget my mother. Good night, Margaret."

She let him out and bolted the door behind him. He stood on the steps
to adjust some fastening about the bundle. The court, the street, was
deeply still. Long ago had all retired to rest on that quiet Sabbath
evening. The stars shone down on the silent deserted streets, and
the soft clear moonlight fell in bright masses, leaving the steps on
which Jem stood in shadow.

A foot-fall was heard along the pavement; slow and heavy was the
sound. Before Jem had ended his little piece of business, a form
had glided into sight; a wan, feeble figure, bearing, with evident
and painful labour, a jug of water from the neighbouring pump. It
went before Jem, turned up the court at the corner of which he was
standing, passed into the broad, calm light; and there, with bowed
head, sinking and shrunk body, Jem recognised John Barton.

No haunting ghost could have had less of the energy of life in its
involuntary motions than he, who, nevertheless, went on with the
same measured clock-work tread until the door of his own house was
reached. And then he disappeared, and the latch fell feebly to, and
made a faint and wavering sound, breaking the solemn silence of the
night. Then all again was still.

For a minute or two Jem stood motionless, stunned by the thoughts
which the sight of Mary's father had called up.

Margaret did not know he was at home: had he stolen like a thief by
dead of night into his own dwelling? Depressed as Jem had often and
long seen him, this night there was something different about him
still; beaten down by some inward storm, he seemed to grovel along,
all self-respect lost and gone.

Must he be told of Mary's state? Jem felt he must not; and this for
many reasons. He could not be informed of her illness without many
other particulars being communicated at the same time, of which it
were better he should be kept in ignorance; indeed, of which Mary
herself could alone give the full explanation. No suspicion that he
was the criminal seemed hitherto to have been excited in the mind of
any one. Added to these reasons was Jem's extreme unwillingness to
face him, with the belief in his breast that he, and none other, had
done the fearful deed.

It was true that he was Mary's father, and as such had every right
to be told of all concerning her; but supposing he were, and that
he followed the impulse so natural to a father, and wished to go to
her, what might be the consequences? Among the mingled feelings she
had revealed in her delirium, ay, mingled even with the most tender
expressions of love for her father, was a sort of horror of him; a
dread of him as a blood-shedder, which seemed to separate him into
two persons,--one, the father who had dandled her on his knee, and
loved her all her life long; the other, the assassin, the cause of
all her trouble and woe.

If he presented himself before her while this idea of his character
was uppermost, who might tell the consequence?

Jem could not, and would not, expose her to any such fearful chance:
and to tell the truth, I believe he looked upon her as more his
own, to guard from all shadow of injury with most loving care, than
as belonging to any one else in this world, though girt with the
reverend name of Father, and guiltless of aught that might have
lessened such reverence.

If you think this account of mine confused, of the half-feelings,
half-reasons, which passed through Jem's mind, as he stood gazing at
the empty space, where that crushed form had so lately been seen,--if
you are perplexed to disentangle the real motives, I do assure you
it was from just such an involved set of thoughts that Jem drew the
resolution to act as if he had not seen that phantom likeness of John
Barton; himself, yet not himself.




CHAPTER XXXIV.

THE RETURN HOME.


   "_Dixwell._ Forgiveness! Oh, forgiveness, and a grave!
   _Mary._     God knows thy heart, my father! and I shudder
               To think what thou perchance hast acted.
   _Dixwell._  Oh!
   _Mary._     No common load of woe is thine, my father."

   ELLIOTT'S "KERHONAH."


Mary still hovered between life and death when Jem arrived at the
house where she lay; and the doctors were as yet unwilling to
compromise their wisdom by allowing too much hope to be entertained.
But the state of things, if not less anxious, was less distressing
than when Jem had quitted her. She lay now in a stupor, which was
partly disease, and partly exhaustion after the previous excitement.

And now Jem found the difficulty which every one who has watched by
a sick bed knows full well; and which is perhaps more insurmountable
to men than it is to women,--the difficulty of being patient, and
trying not to expect any visible change for long, long hours of sad
monotony.

But after awhile the reward came. The laboured breathing became
lower and softer, the heavy look of oppressive pain melted away
from the face, and a languor that was almost peace took the place
of suffering. She slept a natural sleep; and they stole about on
tip-toe, and spoke low, and softly, and hardly dared to breathe,
however much they longed to sigh out their thankful relief.

She opened her eyes. Her mind was in the tender state of a
lately-born infant's. She was pleased with the gay but not dazzling
colours of the paper; soothed by the subdued light; and quite
sufficiently amused by looking at all the objects in the room,--the
drawing of the ships, the festoons of the curtain, the bright flowers
on the painted backs of the chairs,--to care for any stronger
excitement. She wondered at the ball of glass, containing various
coloured sands from the Isle of Wight, or some such place, which hung
suspended from the middle of the little valance over the window. But
she did not care to exert herself to ask any questions, although she
saw Mrs. Sturgis standing at the bed-side with some tea, ready to
drop it into her mouth by spoonfuls.

She did not see the face of honest joy, of earnest thankfulness,--the
clasped hands,--the beaming eyes,--the trembling eagerness of
gesture, of one who had long awaited her awakening, and who now stood
behind the curtains watching through some little chink her every
faint motion; or if she had caught a glimpse of that loving, peeping
face, she was in too exhausted a state to have taken much notice,
or have long retained the impression that he she loved so well was
hanging about her, and blessing God for every conscious look which
stole over her countenance.

She fell softly into slumber, without a word having been spoken by
any one during that half hour of inexpressible joy. And again the
stillness was enforced by sign and whispered word, but with eyes that
beamed out their bright thoughts of hope. Jem sat by the side of the
bed, holding back the little curtain, and gazing as if he could never
gaze his fill at the pale, wasted face, so marbled and so chiselled
in its wan outline.

She wakened once more; her soft eyes opened, and met his over-bending
look. She smiled gently, as a baby does when it sees its mother
tending its little cot; and continued her innocent, infantine gaze
into his face, as if the sight gave her much unconscious pleasure.
But by-and-by a different expression came into her sweet eyes; a look
of memory and intelligence; her white face flushed the brightest rosy
red, and with feeble motion she tried to hide her head in the pillow.

It required all Jem's self-control to do what he knew and felt to
be necessary, to call Mrs. Sturgis, who was quietly dozing by the
fireside; and that done, he felt almost obliged to leave the room to
keep down the happy agitation which would gush out in every feature,
every gesture, and every tone.

From that time forward Mary's progress towards health was rapid.

There was every reason, but one, in favour of her speedy removal
home. All Jem's duties lay in Manchester. It was his mother's
dwelling-place, and there his plans for life had been to be worked
out; plans, which the suspicion and imprisonment he had fallen into,
had thrown for a time into a chaos, which his presence was required
to arrange into form. For he might find, in spite of a jury's
verdict, that too strong a taint was on his character for him ever to
labour in Manchester again. He remembered the manner in which some
one suspected of having been a convict was shunned by masters and
men, when he had accidentally met with work in their foundry; the
recollection smote him now, how he himself had thought that it did
not become an honest upright man to associate with one who had been
a prisoner. He could not choose but think on that poor humble being,
with his downcast conscious look; hunted out of the work-shop,
where he had sought to earn an honest livelihood, by the looks, and
half-spoken words, and the black silence of repugnance (worse than
words to bear), that met him on all sides.

Jem felt that his own character had been attainted; and that to many
it might still appear suspicious. He knew that he could convince the
world, by a future as blameless as his past had been, that he was
innocent. But at the same time he saw that he must have patience, and
nerve himself for some trials; and the sooner these were undergone,
the sooner he was aware of the place he held in men's estimation, the
better. He longed to have presented himself once more at the foundry;
and then the reality would drive away the pictures that would
(unbidden) come of a shunned man, eyed askance by all, and driven
forth to shape out some new career.

I said every reason "but one" inclined Jem to hasten Mary's return as
soon as she was sufficiently convalescent. That one was the meeting
which awaited her at home.

Turn it over as Jem would, he could not decide what was the best
course to pursue. He could compel himself to any line of conduct
that his reason and his sense of right told him to be desirable;
but they did not tell him it was desirable to speak to Mary, in her
tender state of mind and body, of her father. How much would be
implied by the mere mention of his name! Speak it as calmly, and
as indifferently as he might, he could not avoid expressing some
consciousness of the terrible knowledge she possessed.

She, for her part, was softer and gentler than she had ever been in
her gentlest mood; since her illness, her motions, her glances, her
voice were all tender in their languor. It seemed almost a trouble to
her to break the silence with the low sounds of her own sweet voice,
and her words fell sparingly on Jem's greedy, listening ear.

Her face was, however, so full of love and confidence, that Jem felt
no uneasiness at the state of silent abstraction into which she often
fell. If she did but love him, all would yet go right; and it was
better not to press for confidence on that one subject which must be
painful to both.

There came a fine, bright, balmy day. And Mary tottered once more out
into the open air, leaning on Jem's arm, and close to his beating
heart. And Mrs. Sturgis watched them from her door, with a blessing
on her lips, as they went slowly up the street.

They came in sight of the river. Mary shuddered.

"Oh, Jem! take me home. Yon river seems all made of glittering,
heaving, dazzling metal, just as it did when I began to be ill."

Jem led her homewards. She dropped her head as searching for
something on the ground.

"Jem!" He was all attention. She paused for an instant. "When may I
go home? To Manchester, I mean. I am so weary of this place; and I
would fain be at home."

She spoke in a feeble voice; not at all impatiently, as the words
themselves would seem to intimate, but in a mournful way, as if
anticipating sorrow even in the very fulfilment of her wishes.

"Darling! we will go whenever you wish; whenever you feel strong
enough. I asked Job to tell Margaret to get all in readiness for you
to go there at first. She'll tend you and nurse you. You must not go
home. Job proffered for you to go there."

"Ah! but I must go home, Jem. I'll try and not fail now in what's
right. There are things we must not speak on" (lowering her voice),
"but you'll be really kind if you'll not speak against my going home.
Let us say no more about it, dear Jem. I must go home, and I must go
alone."

"Not alone, Mary!"

"Yes, alone! I cannot tell you why I ask it. And if you guess, I know
you well enough to be sure you'll understand why I ask you never to
speak on that again to me, till I begin. Promise, dear Jem, promise!"

He promised; to gratify that beseeching face he promised. And then he
repented, and felt as if he had done ill. Then again he felt as if
she were the best judge, and knowing all (perhaps more than even he
did) might be forming plans which his interference would mar.

One thing was certain! it was a miserable thing to have this awful
forbidden ground of discourse; to guess at each other's thoughts,
when eyes were averted, and cheeks blanched, and words stood still,
arrested in their flow by some casual allusion.

At last a day, fine enough for Mary to travel on, arrived. She had
wished to go, but now her courage failed her. How could she have said
she was weary of that quiet house, where even Ben Sturgis' grumblings
only made a kind of harmonious bass in the concord between him and
his wife, so thoroughly did they know each other with the knowledge
of many years! How could she have longed to quit that little peaceful
room where she had experienced such loving tendence! Even the very
check bed-curtains became dear to her under the idea of seeing them
no more. If it was so with inanimate objects, if they had such power
of exciting regret, what were her feelings with regard to the kind
old couple, who had taken the stranger in, and cared for her, and
nursed her, as though she had been a daughter? Each wilful sentence
spoken in the half unconscious irritation of feebleness came now with
avenging self-reproach to her memory, as she hung about Mrs. Sturgis,
with many tears, which served instead of words to express her
gratitude and love.

Ben bustled about with the square bottle of Goldenwasser in one of
his hands, and a small tumbler in the other; he went to Mary, Jem,
and his wife in succession, pouring out a glass for each and bidding
them drink it to keep their spirits up: but as each severally
refused, he drank it himself; and passed on to offer the same
hospitality to another with the like refusal, and the like result.

When he had swallowed the last of the three draughts, he condescended
to give his reasons for having done so.

"I cannot abide waste. What's poured out mun be drunk. That's my
maxim." So saying, he replaced the bottle in the cupboard.

It was he who in a firm commanding voice at last told Jem and Mary
to be off, or they would be too late. Mrs. Sturgis had kept up till
then; but as they left her house, she could no longer restrain her
tears, and cried aloud in spite of her husband's upbraiding.

"Perhaps they'll be too late for th' train!" exclaimed she, with a
degree of hope, as the clock struck two.

"What! and come back again! No! no! that would never do. We've done
our part, and cried our cry; it's no use going o'er the same ground
again. I should ha' to give 'em more out of yon bottle when next
parting time came, and them three glasses they had made a hole in
the stuff, I can tell you. Time Jack was back from Hamburg with some
more."

When they reached Manchester, Mary looked very white, and the
expression on her face was almost stern. She was in fact summoning up
her resolution to meet her father if he were at home. Jem had never
named his midnight glimpse of John Barton to human being; but Mary
had a sort of presentiment that wander where he would, he would seek
his home at last. But in what mood she dreaded to think. For the
knowledge of her father's capability of guilt seemed to have opened
a dark gulf in his character, into the depths of which she trembled
to look. At one moment she would fain have claimed protection
against the life she must lead, for some time at least, alone with
a murderer! She thought of his gloom, before his mind was haunted
by the memory of so terrible a crime; his moody, irritable ways. She
imagined the evenings as of old: she, toiling at some work, long
after houses were shut, and folks abed; he, more savage than he had
ever been before with the inward gnawing of his remorse. At such
times she could have cried aloud with terror, at the scenes her fancy
conjured up.

But her filial duty, nay, her love and gratitude for many deeds of
kindness done to her as a little child, conquered all fear. She would
endure all imaginable terrors, although of daily occurrence. And
she would patiently bear all wayward violence of temper; more than
patiently would she bear it--pitifully, as one who knew of some awful
curse awaiting the blood-shedder. She would watch over him tenderly,
as the Innocent should watch over the Guilty; awaiting the gracious
seasons, wherein to pour oil and balm into the bitter wounds.

With the untroubled peace which the resolve to endure to the end
gives, she approached the house that from habit she still called
home, but which possessed the holiness of home no longer.

"Jem!" said she, as they stood at the entrance to the court, close
by Job Legh's door, "you must go in there and wait half-an-hour. Not
less. If in that time I don't come back, you go your ways to your
mother. Give her my dear love. I will send by Margaret when I want to
see you." She sighed heavily.

"Mary! Mary! I cannot leave you. You speak as coldly as if we were to
be nought to each other. And my heart's bound up in you. I know why
you bid me keep away, but--"

She put her hand on his arm, as he spoke in a loud agitated tone; she
looked into his face with upbraiding love in her eyes, and then she
said, while her lips quivered, and he felt her whole frame trembling:

"Dear Jem! I often could have told you more of love, if I had not
once spoken out so free. Remember that time, Jem, if ever you think
me cold. Then, the love that's in my heart would out in words; but
now, though I'm silent on the pain I'm feeling in quitting you, the
love is in my heart all the same. But this is not the time to speak
on such things. If I do not do what I feel to be right now, I may
blame myself all my life long! Jem, you promised--"

And so saying she left him. She went quicker than she would otherwise
have passed over those few yards of ground, for fear he should still
try to accompany her. Her hand was on the latch, and in a breath the
door was opened.

There sat her father, still and motionless--not even turning his head
to see who had entered; but perhaps he recognised the foot-step,--the
trick of action.

He sat by the fire; the grate I should say, for fire there was none.
Some dull, gray ashes, negligently left, long days ago, coldly choked
up the bars. He had taken the accustomed seat from mere force of
habit, which ruled his automaton-body. For all energy, both physical
and mental, seemed to have retreated inwards to some of the great
citadels of life, there to do battle against the Destroyer,
Conscience.

His hands were crossed, his fingers interlaced; usually a position
implying some degree of resolution, or strength; but in him it was so
faintly maintained, that it appeared more the result of chance; an
attitude requiring some application of outward force to alter,--and a
blow with a straw seemed as though it would be sufficient.

And as for his face, it was sunk and worn,--like a skull, with yet
a suffering expression that skulls have not! Your heart would have
ached to have seen the man, however hardly you might have judged his
crime.

But crime and all was forgotten by his daughter, as she saw his
abashed look, his smitten helplessness. All along she had felt it
difficult (as I may have said before) to reconcile the two ideas, of
her father and a blood-shedder. But now it was impossible. He was her
father! her own dear father! and in his sufferings, whatever their
cause, more dearly loved than ever before. His crime was a thing
apart, never more to be considered by her.

And tenderly did she treat him, and fondly did she serve him in every
way that heart could devise, or hand execute.

She had some money about her, the price of her strange services as a
witness; and when the lingering dusk drew on, she stole out to effect
some purchases necessary for her father's comfort.

For how body and soul had been kept together, even as much as they
were, during the days he had dwelt alone, no one can say. The house
was bare as when Mary had left it, of coal, or of candle, of food, or
of blessing in any shape.

She came quickly home; but as she passed Job Legh's door, she
stopped. Doubtless Jem had long since gone; and doubtless, too, he
had given Margaret some good reason for not intruding upon her friend
for this night at least, otherwise Mary would have seen her before
now.

But to-morrow,--would she not come in to-morrow? And who so quick as
blind Margaret in noticing tones, and sighs, and even silence?

She did not give herself time for further thought, her desire to be
once more with her father was too pressing; but she opened the door,
before she well knew what to say.

"It's Mary Barton! I know her by her breathing! Grandfather, it's
Mary Barton!"

Margaret's joy at meeting her, the open demonstration of her love,
affected Mary much; she could not keep from crying, and sat down weak
and agitated on the first chair she could find.

"Ay, ay, Mary! thou'rt looking a bit different to when I saw thee
last. Thou'lt give Jem and me good characters for sick nurses, I
trust. If all trades fail, I'll turn to that. Jem's place is for
life, I reckon. Nay, never redden so, lass. You and he know each
other's minds by this time!"

Margaret held her hand, and gently smiled into her face.

Job Legh took the candle up, and began a leisurely inspection.

"Thou hast getten a bit of pink in thy cheeks,--not much; but when
last I saw thee, thy lips were as white as a sheet. Thy nose is
sharpish at th' end; thou'rt more like thy father than ever thou wert
before. Lord! child, what's the matter? Art thou going to faint?"

For Mary had sickened at the mention of that name; yet she felt that
now or never was the time to speak.

"Father's come home!" she said, "but he's very poorly; I never saw
him as he is now, before. I asked Jem not to come near him for fear
it might fidget him."

She spoke hastily, and (to her own idea) in an unnatural manner. But
they did not seem to notice it, nor to take the hint she had thrown
out of company being unacceptable; for Job Legh directly put down
some insect, which he was impaling on a corking-pin, and exclaimed,

"Thy father come home! Why, Jem never said a word of it! And ailing
too! I'll go in, and cheer him with a bit of talk. I ne'er knew any
good come of delegating it."

"Oh, Job! father cannot stand--father is too ill. Don't come; not
but that you're very kind and good; but to-night--indeed," said she
at last, in despair, seeing Job still persevere in putting away his
things; "you must not come till I send or come for you. Father's in
that strange way, I can't answer for it if he sees strangers. Please
don't come. I'll come and tell you every day how he goes on. I must
be off now to see after him. Dear Job! kind Job! don't be angry with
me. If you knew all you'd pity me."

For Job was muttering away in high dudgeon, and even Margaret's
tone was altered as she wished Mary good night. Just then she could
ill brook coldness from any one, and least of all bear the idea of
being considered ungrateful by so kind and zealous a friend as Job
had been; so she turned round suddenly, even when her hand was on
the latch of the door, and ran back, and threw her arms about his
neck, and kissed him first, and then Margaret. And then, the tears
fast-falling down her cheeks, but no word spoken, she hastily left
the house, and went back to her home.

There was no change in her father's position, or in his spectral
look. He had answered her questions (but few in number, for so many
subjects were unapproachable) by monosyllables, and in a weak, high,
childish voice; but he had not lifted his eyes; he could not meet
his daughter's look. And she, when she spoke, or as she moved about,
avoided letting her eyes rest upon him. She wished to be her usual
self; but while every thing was done with a consciousness of purpose,
she felt it was impossible.

In this manner things went on for some days. At night he feebly
clambered up stairs to bed; and during those long dark hours Mary
heard those groans of agony which never escaped his lips by day, when
they were compressed in silence over his inward woe.

Many a time she sat up listening, and wondering if it would ease his
miserable heart if she went to him, and told him she knew all, and
loved and pitied him more than words could tell.

By day the monotonous hours wore on in the same heavy, hushed manner
as on that first dreary afternoon. He ate,--but without relish; and
food seemed no longer to nourish him, for each morning his face had
caught more of the ghastly fore-shadowing of Death.

The neighbours kept strangely aloof. Of late years John Barton had
had a repellent power about him, felt by all, except to the few who
had either known him in his better and happier days, or those to whom
he had given his sympathy and his confidence. People did not care to
enter the doors of one whose very depth of thoughtfulness rendered
him moody and stern. And now they contented themselves with a kind
inquiry when they saw Mary in her goings-out or in her comings-in.
With her oppressing knowledge, she imagined their reserved conduct
stranger than it was in reality. She missed Job and Margaret
too; who, in all former times of sorrow or anxiety since their
acquaintance first began, had been ready with their sympathy.

But most of all she missed the delicious luxury she had lately
enjoyed in having Jem's tender love at hand every hour of the day, to
ward off every wind of heaven, and every disturbing thought.

She knew he was often hovering about the house; though the knowledge
seemed to come more by intuition, than by any positive sight or sound
for the first day or two. On the third day she met him at Job Legh's.

They received her with every effort of cordiality; but still there
was a cobweb-veil of separation between them, to which Mary was
morbidly acute; while in Jem's voice, and eyes, and manner, there was
every evidence of most passionate, most admiring, and most trusting
love. The trust was shown by his respectful silence on that one point
of reserve on which she had interdicted conversation.

He left Job Legh's house when she did. They lingered on the step,
he holding her hand between both of his, as loth to let her go; he
questioned her as to when he should see her again.

"Mother does so want to see you," whispered he. "Can you come to see
her to-morrow? or when?"

"I cannot tell," replied she, softly. "Not yet. Wait awhile; perhaps
only a little while. Dear Jem, I must go to him,--dearest Jem."

The next day, the fourth from Mary's return home, as she was sitting
near the window, sadly dreaming over some work, she caught a glimpse
of the last person she wished to see--of Sally Leadbitter!

She was evidently coming to their house; another moment, and she
tapped at the door. John Barton gave an anxious, uneasy side-glance.
Mary knew that if she delayed answering the knock, Sally would not
scruple to enter; so as hastily as if the visit had been desired, she
opened the door, and stood there with the latch in her hand, barring
up all entrance, and as much as possible obstructing all curious
glances into the interior.

"Well, Mary Barton! You're home at last! I heard you'd getten home;
so I thought I'd just step over and hear the news."

She was bent on coming in, and saw Mary's preventive design. So she
stood on tip-toe, looking over Mary's shoulders into the room where
she suspected a lover to be lurking; but instead, she saw only the
figure of the stern, gloomy father she had always been in the habit
of avoiding; and she dropped down again, content to carry on the
conversation where Mary chose, and as Mary chose, in whispers.

"So the old governor is back again, eh? And what does he say to all
your fine doings at Liverpool, and before?--you and I know where. You
can't hide it now, Mary, for it's all in print."

Mary gave a low moan,--and then implored Sally to change the subject;
for unpleasant as it always was, it was doubly unpleasant in the
manner in which she was treating it. If they had been alone, Mary
would have borne it patiently,--or so she thought,--but now she
felt almost certain her father was listening; there was a subdued
breathing, a slight bracing-up of the listless attitude. But there
was no arresting Sally's curiosity to hear all she could respecting
the adventures Mary had experienced. She, in common with the rest of
Miss Simmonds' young ladies, was almost jealous of the fame that Mary
had obtained; to herself, such miserable notoriety.

"Nay! there's no use shunning talking it over. Why! it was in the
_Guardian_,--and the _Courier_,--and some one told Jane Hodson it was
even copied into a London paper. You've set up heroine on your own
account, Mary Barton. How did you like standing witness? Ar'n't them
lawyers impudent things? staring at one so. I'll be bound you wished
you'd taken my offer, and borrowed my black watered scarf! Now didn't
you, Mary? Speak truth!"

"To tell truth, I never thought about it then, Sally. How could I?"
asked she, reproachfully.

"Oh--I forgot. You were all for that stupid James Wilson. Well! if
I've ever the luck to go witness on a trial, see if I don't pick up a
better beau than the prisoner. I'll aim at a lawyer's clerk, but I'll
not take less than a turnkey."

Cast down as Mary was, she could hardly keep from smiling at the
idea, so wildly incongruous with the scene she had really undergone,
of looking out for admirers during a trial for murder.

"I'd no thought to be looking out for beaux, I can assure you,
Sally.--But don't let us talk any more about it; I can't bear to
think on it. How is Miss Simmonds? and everybody?"

"Oh, very well; and by the way she gave me a bit of a message for
you. You may come back to work if you'll behave yourself, she says.
I told you she'd be glad to have you back, after all this piece of
business, by way of tempting people to come to her shop. They'd come
from Salford to have a peep at you, for six months at least."

"Don't talk so; I cannot come, I can never face Miss Simmonds again.
And even if I could--" she stopped, and blushed.

"Ay! I know what you're thinking on. But that will not be this some
time, as he's turned off from the foundry,--you'd better think twice
afore refusing Miss Simmonds' offer."

"Turned off from the foundry! Jem?" cried Mary.

"To be sure! didn't you know it? Decent men were not going to work
with a--no! I suppose I mustn't say it, seeing you went to such
trouble to get up an _alibi_; not that I should think much the worse
of a spirited young fellow for falling foul of a rival,--they always
do at the theatre."

But Mary's thoughts were with Jem. How good he had been never to name
his dismissal to her. How much he had had to endure for her sake!

"Tell me all about it," she gasped out.

"Why, you see, they've always swords quite handy at them plays,"
began Sally; but Mary, with an impatient shake of her head,
interrupted,

"About Jem,--about Jem, I want to know."

"Oh! I don't pretend to know more than is in every one's mouth:
he's turned away from the foundry, because folks don't think you've
cleared him outright of the murder; though perhaps the jury were loth
to hang him. Old Mr. Carson is savage against judge and jury, and
lawyers and all, as I heard."

"I must go to him, I must go to him," repeated Mary, in a hurried
manner.

"He'll tell you all I've said is true, and not a word of lie,"
replied Sally. "So I'll not give your answer to Miss Simmonds, but
leave you to think twice about it. Good afternoon!"

Mary shut the door, and turned into the house.

Her father sat in the same attitude; the old unchanging attitude.
Only his head was more bowed towards the ground.

She put on her bonnet to go to Ancoats; for see, and question, and
comfort, and worship Jem, she must.

As she hung about her father for an instant before leaving him, he
spoke--voluntarily spoke for the first time since her return; but
his head was drooping so low she could not hear what he said, so she
stooped down; and after a moment's pause, he repeated the words,

"Tell Jem Wilson to come here at eight o'clock to-night."

Could he have overheard her conversation with Sally Leadbitter? They
had whispered low, she thought. Pondering on this, and many other
things, she reached Ancoats.




CHAPTER XXXV.

"FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES."


                  "Oh, had he lived,
   Replied Rusilla, never penitence
   Had equalled his! full well I know his heart,
   Vehement in all things. He would on himself
   Have wreaked such penance as had reached the height
   Of fleshly suffering,--yea, which being told,
   With its portentous rigour should have made
   The memory of his fault, o'erpowered and lost
   In shuddering pity and astonishment,
   Fade like a feeble horror."

   SOUTHEY'S "RODERICK."


As Mary was turning into the street where the Wilsons lived, Jem
overtook her. He came upon her suddenly, and she started.

"You're going to see mother?" he asked tenderly, placing her arm
within his, and slackening his pace.

"Yes, and you too. Oh, Jem, is it true? tell me."

She felt rightly that he would guess the meaning of her only half
expressed inquiry. He hesitated a moment before he answered her.

"Darling, it is; it's no use hiding it--if you mean that I'm no
longer to work at Duncombe's foundry. It's no time (to my mind) to
have secrets from each other, though I did not name it yesterday,
thinking you might fret. I shall soon get work again, never fear."

"But why did they turn you off, when the jury had said you were
innocent?"

"It was not just to say turned off, though I don't think I could have
well stayed on. A good number of the men managed to let out they
should not like to work under me again; there were some few who
knew me well enough to feel I could not have done it, but more were
doubtful; and one spoke to young Mr. Duncombe, hinting at what they
thought."

"Oh Jem! what a shame!" said Mary, with mournful indignation.

"Nay, darling! I'm not for blaming them. Poor fellows like them have
nought to stand upon and be proud of but their character, and it's
fitting they should take care of that, and keep that free from soil
and taint."

"But you,--what could they get but good from you? They might have
known you by this time."

"So some do; the overlooker, I'm sure, would know I'm innocent.
Indeed, he said as much to-day; and he said he had had some talk
with old Mr. Duncombe, and they thought it might be better if I left
Manchester for a bit; they'd recommend me to some other place."

But Mary could only shake her head in a mournful way, and repeat her
words,

"They might have known thee better, Jem."

Jem pressed the little hand he held between his own work-hardened
ones. After a minute or two, he asked,

"Mary, art thou much bound to Manchester? Would it grieve thee sore
to quit the old smoke-jack?"

"With thee?" she asked, in a quiet, glancing way.

"Ay, lass! Trust me, I'll ne'er ask thee to leave Manchester while
I'm in it. Because I've heard fine things of Canada; and our
overlooker has a cousin in the foundry line there.--Thou knowest
where Canada is, Mary?"

"Not rightly--not now, at any rate;--but with thee, Jem," her voice
sunk to a soft, low whisper, "anywhere--"

What was the use of a geographical description?

"But father!" said Mary, suddenly breaking that delicious silence
with the one sharp discord in her present life.

She looked up at her lover's grave face; and then the message her
father had sent flashed across her memory.

"Oh, Jem, did I tell you?--Father sent word he wished to speak with
you. I was to bid you come to him at eight to-night. What can he
want, Jem?"

"I cannot tell," replied he. "At any rate I'll go. It's no use
troubling ourselves to guess," he continued, after a pause of a few
minutes, during which they slowly and silently paced up and down the
by-street, into which he had led her when their conversation began.
"Come and see mother, and then I'll take thee home, Mary. Thou wert
all in a tremble when first I came up with thee; thou'rt not fit to
be trusted home by thyself," said he, with fond exaggeration of her
helplessness.

Yet a little more lovers' loitering; a few more words, in themselves
nothing--to you nothing, but to those two what tender passionate
language can I use to express the feelings which thrilled through
that young man and maiden, as they listened to the syllables made
dear and lovely through life by that hour's low-whispered talk.

It struck the half hour past seven.

"Come and speak to mother; she knows you're to be her daughter, Mary,
darling."

So they went in. Jane Wilson was rather chafed at her son's delay in
returning home, for as yet he had managed to keep her in ignorance of
his dismissal from the foundry; and it was her way to prepare some
little pleasure, some little comfort for those she loved; and if
they, unwittingly, did not appear at the proper time to enjoy her
preparation, she worked herself up into a state of fretfulness
which found vent in upbraidings as soon as ever the objects of her
care appeared, thereby marring the peace which should ever be the
atmosphere of a home, however humble; and causing a feeling almost
amounting to loathing to arise at the sight of the "stalled ox,"
which, though an effect and proof of careful love, has been the cause
of so much disturbance.

Mrs. Wilson had first sighed, and then grumbled to herself, over the
increasing toughness of the potato-cakes she had made for her son's
tea.

The door opened, and he came in; his face brightening into proud
smiles, Mary Barton hanging on his arm, blushing and dimpling, with
eye-lids veiling the happy light of her eyes,--there was around the
young couple a radiant atmosphere--a glory of happiness.

Could his mother mar it? Could she break into it with her Martha-like
cares? Only for one moment did she remember her sense of injury,--her
wasted trouble,--and then, her whole woman's heart heaving with
motherly love and sympathy, she opened her arms, and received Mary
into them, as, shedding tears of agitated joy, she murmured in her
ear,

"Bless thee, Mary, bless thee! Only make him happy, and God bless
thee for ever!"

It took some of Jem's self-command to separate those whom he so much
loved, and who were beginning, for his sake, to love one another so
dearly. But the time for his meeting John Barton drew on: and it was
a long way to his house.

As they walked briskly thither they hardly spoke; though many
thoughts were in their minds.

The sun had not long set, but the first faint shade of twilight was
over all; and when they opened the door, Jem could hardly perceive
the objects within by the waning light of day, and the flickering
fire-blaze.

But Mary saw all at a glance!

Her eye, accustomed to what was usual in the aspect of the room, saw
instantly what was unusual,--saw, and understood it all.

Her father was standing behind his habitual chair, holding by the
back of it as if for support. And opposite to him there stood Mr.
Carson; the dark out-line of his stern figure looming large against
the light of the fire in that little room.

Behind her father sat Job Legh, his head in his hands, and resting
his elbows on the little family table,--listening evidently; but as
evidently deeply affected by what he heard.

There seemed to be some pause in the conversation. Mary and Jem stood
at the half-open door, not daring to stir; hardly to breathe.

"And have I heard you aright?" began Mr. Carson, with his deep
quivering voice. "Man! have I heard you aright? Was it you, then,
that killed my boy? my only son?"--(he said these last few words
almost as if appealing for pity, and then he changed his tone to
one more vehement and fierce). "Don't dare to think that I shall be
merciful, and spare you, because you have come forward to accuse
yourself. I tell you I will not spare you the least pang the law can
inflict,--you, who did not show pity on my boy, shall have none from
me."

"I did not ask for any," said John Barton, in a low voice.

"Ask, or not ask, what care I? You shall be hanged--hanged--man!"
said he, advancing his face, and repeating the word with slow,
grinding emphasis, as if to infuse some of the bitterness of his soul
into it.

John Barton gasped, but not with fear. It was only that he felt it
terrible to have inspired such hatred, as was concentrated into every
word, every gesture of Mr. Carson's.

"As for being hanged, sir, I know it's all right and proper. I dare
say it's bad enough; but I tell you what, sir," speaking with an
out-burst, "if you'd hanged me the day after I'd done the deed, I
would have gone down on my knees and blessed you. Death! Lord, what
is it to Life? To such a life as I've been leading this fortnight
past. Life at best is no great thing; but such a life as I have
dragged through since that night," he shuddered at the thought. "Why,
sir, I've been on the point of killing myself this many a time to
get away from my own thoughts. I didn't! and I'll tell you why.
I didn't know but that I should be more haunted than ever with
the recollection of my sin. Oh! God above only can tell the agony
with which I've repented me of it, and part perhaps because I
feared He would think I were impatient of the misery He sent as
punishment--far, far worse misery than any hanging, sir." He ceased
from excess of emotion.

Then he began again.

"Sin' that day (it may be very wicked, sir, but it's the truth) I've
kept thinking and thinking if I were but in that world where they say
God is, He would, may be, teach me right from wrong, even if it were
with many stripes. I've been sore puzzled here. I would go through
Hell-fire if I could but get free from sin at last, it's such an
awful thing. As for hanging, that's just nought at all."

His exhaustion compelled him to sit down. Mary rushed to him. It
seemed as if till then he had been unaware of her presence.

"Ay, ay, wench!" said he feebly, "is it thee? Where's Jem Wilson?"

Jem came forward. John Barton spoke again, with many a break and
gasping pause,

"Lad! thou hast borne a deal for me. It's the meanest thing I ever
did to leave thee to bear the brunt. Thou, who wert as innocent of
any knowledge of it as the babe unborn. I'll not bless thee for it.
Blessing from such as me would not bring thee any good. Thou'lt love
Mary, though she is my child."

He ceased, and there was a pause of a few seconds.

Then Mr. Carson turned to go. When his hand was on the latch of the
door, he hesitated for an instant.

"You can have no doubt for what purpose I go. Straight to the
police-office, to send men to take care of you, wretched man, and
your accomplice. To-morrow morning your tale shall be repeated to
those who can commit you to gaol, and before long you shall have the
opportunity of trying how desirable hanging is."

"Oh, sir!" said Mary, springing forward, and catching hold of Mr.
Carson's arm, "my father is dying. Look at him, sir. If you want
Death for Death, you have it. Don't take him away from me these last
hours. He must go alone through Death, but let me be with him as long
as I can. Oh, sir! if you have any mercy in you, leave him here to
die."

John himself stood up, stiff and rigid, and replied,

"Mary, wench! I owe him summut. I will go die, where, and as he
wishes me. Thou hast said true, I am standing side by side with
Death; and it matters little where I spend the bit of time left of
Life. That time I must pass in wrestling with my soul for a character
to take into the other world. I'll go where you see fit, sir. He's
innocent," faintly indicating Jem, as he fell back in his chair.

"Never fear! They cannot touch him," said Job Legh, in a low voice.

But as Mr. Carson was on the point of leaving the house with no sign
of relenting about him, he was again stopped by John Barton, who had
risen once more from his chair, and stood supporting himself on Jem,
while he spoke.

"Sir, one word! My hairs are gray with suffering, and yours with
years--"

"And have I had no suffering?" asked Mr. Carson, as if appealing for
sympathy, even to the murderer of his child.

And the murderer of his child answered to the appeal, and groaned in
spirit over the anguish he had caused.

"Have I had no inward suffering to blanch these hairs? Have not I
toiled and struggled even to these years with hopes in my heart that
all centered in my boy? I did not speak of them, but were they not
there? I seemed hard and cold; and so I might be to others, but not
to him!--who shall ever imagine the love I bore to him? Even he never
dreamed how my heart leapt up at the sound of his footstep, and how
precious he was to his poor old father.--And he is gone--killed--out
of the hearing of all loving words--out of my sight for ever. He was
my sunshine, and now it is night! Oh, my God! comfort me, comfort
me!" cried the old man aloud.

The eyes of John Barton grew dim with tears. Rich and poor, masters
and men, were then brothers in the deep suffering of the heart; for
was not this the very anguish he had felt for little Tom, in years so
long gone by that they seemed like another life!

The mourner before him was no longer the employer; a being of another
race, eternally placed in antagonistic attitude; going through the
world glittering like gold, with a stony heart within, which knew no
sorrow but through the accidents of Trade; no longer the enemy, the
oppressor, but a very poor and desolate old man.

The sympathy for suffering, formerly so prevalent a feeling with him,
again filled John Barton's heart, and almost impelled him to speak
(as best he could) some earnest, tender words to the stern man,
shaking in his agony.

But who was he, that he should utter sympathy or consolation? The
cause of all this woe.

Oh blasting thought! Oh miserable remembrance! He had forfeited all
right to bind up his brother's wounds.

Stunned by the thought, he sank upon the seat, almost crushed with
the knowledge of the consequences of his own action; for he had
no more imagined to himself the blighted home, and the miserable
parents, than does the soldier, who discharges his musket, picture
to himself the desolation of the wife, and the pitiful cries of the
helpless little ones, who are in an instant to be made widowed and
fatherless.

To intimidate a class of men, known only to those below them as
desirous to obtain the greatest quantity of work for the lowest
wages,--at most to remove an overbearing partner from an obnoxious
firm, who stood in the way of those who struggled as well as they
were able to obtain their rights,--this was the light in which
John Barton had viewed his deed; and even so viewing it, after the
excitement had passed away, the Avenger, the sure Avenger, had found
him out.

But now he knew that he had killed a man, and a brother,--now he knew
that no good thing could come out of this evil, even to the sufferers
whose cause he had so blindly espoused.

He lay across the table, broken-hearted. Every fresh quivering sob of
Mr. Carson's stabbed him to his soul.

He felt execrated by all; and as if he could never lay bare the
perverted reasonings which had made the performance of undoubted sin
appear a duty. The longing to plead some faint excuse grew stronger
and stronger. He feebly raised his head, and looking at Job Legh, he
whispered out,

"I did not know what I was doing, Job Legh; God knows I didn't! Oh,
sir!" said he wildly, almost throwing himself at Mr. Carson's feet,
"say you forgive me the anguish I now see I have caused you. I care
not for pain, or death, you know I don't; but oh, man! forgive me the
trespass I have done!"

"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against
us," said Job, solemnly and low, as if in prayer; as if the words
were suggested by those John Barton had used.

Mr. Carson took his hands away from his face. I would rather see
death than the ghastly gloom which darkened that countenance.

"Let my trespasses be unforgiven, so that I may have vengeance for my
son's murder."

There are blasphemous actions as well as blasphemous words: all
unloving, cruel deeds are acted blasphemy.

Mr. Carson left the house. And John Barton lay on the ground as one
dead.

They lifted him up, and almost hoping that that deep trance might be
to him the end of all earthly things, they bore him to his bed.

For a time they listened with divided attention to his faint
breathings; for in each hasty hurried step that echoed in the street
outside, they thought they heard the approach of the officers of
justice.

When Mr. Carson left the house he was dizzy with agitation; the hot
blood went careering through his frame. He could not see the deep
blue of the night-heavens for the fierce pulses which throbbed in
his head. And partly to steady and calm himself, he leaned against a
railing, and looked up into those calm majestic depths with all their
thousand stars.

And by-and-by his own voice returned upon him, as if the last words
he had spoken were being uttered through all that infinite space; but
in their echoes there was a tone of unutterable sorrow.

"Let my trespasses be unforgiven, so that I may have vengeance for my
son's murder."

He tried to shake off the spiritual impression made by this
imagination. He was feverish and ill,--and no wonder.

So he turned to go homewards; not, as he had threatened, to the
police-office. After all (he told himself), that would do in the
morning. No fear of the man's escaping, unless he escaped to the
grave.

So he tried to banish the phantom voices and shapes which came
unbidden to his brain, and to recall his balance of mind by walking
calmly and slowly, and noticing every thing which struck his senses.

It was a warm soft evening in spring, and there were many persons in
the streets. Among others, a nurse with a little girl in her charge,
conveying her home from some children's gaiety; a dance most likely,
for the lovely little creature was daintily decked out in soft, snowy
muslin; and her fairy feet tripped along by her nurse's side as if to
the measure of some tune she had lately kept time to.

Suddenly up behind her there came a rough, rude errand-boy, nine
or ten years of age; a giant he looked by the fairy-child, as she
fluttered along. I don't know how it was, but in some awkward way
he knocked the poor little girl down upon the hard pavement as he
brushed rudely past, not much caring whom he hurt, so that he got
along.

The child arose sobbing with pain; and not without cause, for blood
was dropping down from the face, but a minute before so fair and
bright--dropping down on the pretty frock, making those scarlet marks
so terrible to little children.

The nurse, a powerful woman, had seized the boy, just as Mr. Carson
(who had seen the whole transaction) came up.

"You naughty little rascal! I'll give you to a policeman, that
I will! Do you see how you've hurt the little girl? Do you?"
accompanying every sentence with a violent jerk of passionate anger.

The lad looked hard and defying; but withal terrified at the threat
of the policeman, those ogres of our streets to all unlucky urchins.
The nurse saw it, and began to drag him along, with a view of making
what she called "a wholesome impression."

His terror increased, and with it his irritation; when the little
sweet face, choking away its sobs, pulled down nurse's head and said,

"Please, dear nurse, I'm not much hurt; it was very silly to cry, you
know. He did not mean to do it. _He did not know what he was doing_,
did you, little boy? Nurse won't call a policeman, so don't be
frightened." And she put up her little mouth to be kissed by her
injurer, just as she had been taught to do at home to "make peace."

"That lad will mind, and be more gentle for the time to come, I'll
be bound, thanks to that little lady," said a passer-by, half to
himself, and half to Mr. Carson, whom he had observed to notice the
scene.

The latter took no apparent heed of the remark, but passed on. But
the child's pleading reminded him of the low, broken voice he had so
lately heard, penitently and humbly urging the same extenuation of
his great guilt.

"I did not know what I was doing."

He had some association with those words; he had heard, or read of
that plea somewhere before. Where was it?

Could it be--?

He would look when he got home. So when he entered his house he went
straight and silently up-stairs to his library, and took down the
great large handsome Bible, all grand and golden, with its leaves
adhering together from the bookbinder's press, so little had it been
used.

On the first page (which fell open to Mr. Carson's view) were written
the names of his children, and his own.

   "Henry John, son of the above John and Elizabeth Carson.
   Born, Sept. 29th, 1815."

To make the entry complete, his death should now be added. But the
page became hidden by the gathering mist of tears.

Thought upon thought, and recollection upon recollection came
crowding in, from the remembrance of the proud day when he had
purchased the costly book, in order to write down the birth of the
little babe of a day old.

He laid his head down on the open page, and let the tears fall slowly
on the spotless leaves.

His son's murderer was discovered; had confessed his guilt; and yet
(strange to say) he could not hate him with the vehemence of hatred
he had felt, when he had imagined him a young man, full of lusty
life, defying all laws, human and divine. In spite of his desire to
retain the revengeful feeling he considered as a duty to his dead
son, something of pity would steal in for the poor, wasted skeleton
of a man, the smitten creature, who had told him of his sin, and
implored his pardon that night.

In the days of his childhood and youth, Mr. Carson had been
accustomed to poverty; but it was honest, decent poverty; not the
grinding squalid misery he had remarked in every part of John
Barton's house, and which contrasted strangely with the pompous
sumptuousness of the room in which he now sat. Unaccustomed wonder
filled his mind at the reflection of the different lots of the
brethren of mankind.

Then he roused himself from his reverie, and turned to the object of
his search--the Gospel, where he half expected to find the tender
pleading: "They know not what they do."

It was murk midnight by this time, and the house was still and quiet.
There was nothing to interrupt the old man in his unwonted study.

Years ago, the Gospel had been his task-book in learning to read. So
many years ago, that he had become familiar with the events before he
could comprehend the Spirit that made the Life.

He fell to the narrative now afresh, with all the interest of a
little child. He began at the beginning, and read on almost greedily,
understanding for the first time the full meaning of the story. He
came to the end; the awful End. And there were the haunting words of
pleading.

He shut the book, and thought deeply.

All night long, the Archangel combated with the Demon.

All night long, others watched by the bed of Death. John Barton had
revived to fitful intelligence. He spoke at times with even something
of his former energy; and in the racy Lancashire dialect he had
always used when speaking freely.

"You see I've so often been hankering after the right way; and it's
a hard one for a poor man to find. At least it's been so to me. No
one learned me, and no one telled me. When I was a little chap they
taught me to read, and then they ne'er gave me no books; only I
heard say the Bible was a good book. So when I grew thoughtful, and
puzzled, I took to it. But you'd never believe black was black, or
night was night, when you saw all about you acting as if black was
white, and night was day. It's not much I can say for myself in
t'other world, God forgive me; but I can say this, I would fain have
gone after the Bible rules if I'd seen folk credit it; they all spoke
up for it, and went and did clean contrary. In those days I would ha'
gone about wi' my Bible, like a little child, my finger in th' place,
and asking the meaning of this or that text, and no one told me. Then
I took out two or three texts as clear as glass, and I tried to do
what they bid me do. But I don't know how it was; masters and men,
all alike cared no more for minding those texts, than I did for th'
Lord Mayor of London; so I grew to think it must be a sham put upon
poor ignorant folk, women, and such-like.

"It was not long I tried to live Gospel-wise, but it was liker heaven
than any other bit of earth has been. I'd old Alice to strengthen me;
but every one else said, 'Stand up for thy rights, or thou'lt never
get 'em;' and wife and children never spoke, but their helplessness
cried aloud, and I was driven to do as others did,--and then Tom
died. You know all about that--I'm getting scant o' breath, and
blind-like."

Then again he spoke, after some minutes of hushed silence.

"All along it came natural to love folk, though now I am what I am.
I think one time I could e'en have loved the masters if they'd ha'
letten me; that was in my Gospel-days, afore my child died o' hunger.
I was tore in two often-times, between my sorrow for poor suffering
folk, and my trying to love them as caused their sufferings (to my
mind).

"At last I gave it up in despair, trying to make folks' actions
square wi' th' Bible; and I thought I'd no longer labour at following
th' Bible mysel. I've said all this afore, may be. But from that time
I've dropped down, down,--down."

After that he only spoke in broken sentences.

"I did not think he'd been such an old man,--Oh! that he had but
forgiven me,"--and then came earnest, passionate, broken words of
prayer.

Job Legh had gone home like one struck down with the unexpected
shock. Mary and Jem together waited the approach of death; but as
the final struggle drew on, and morning dawned, Jem suggested some
alleviation to the gasping breath, to purchase which he left the
house in search of a druggist's shop, which should be open at that
early hour.

During his absence, Barton grew worse; he had fallen across the bed,
and his breathing seemed almost stopped; in vain did Mary strive to
raise him, her sorrow and exhaustion had rendered her too weak.

So, on hearing some one enter the house-place below, she cried out
for Jem to come to her assistance.

A step, which was not Jem's, came up the stairs.

Mr. Carson stood in the door-way. In one instant he comprehended the
case.

He raised up the powerless frame; and the departing soul looked out
of the eyes with gratitude. He held the dying man propped in his
arms. John Barton folded his hands as if in prayer.

"Pray for us," said Mary, sinking on her knees, and forgetting in
that solemn hour all that had divided her father and Mr. Carson.

No other words could suggest themselves than some of those he had
read only a few hours before.

"God be merciful to us sinners.--Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive them that trespass against us."

And when the words were said, John Barton lay a corpse in Mr.
Carson's arms.

So ended the tragedy of a poor man's life.


Mary knew nothing more for many minutes. When she recovered
consciousness, she found herself supported by Jem on the "settle" in
the house-place. Job and Mr. Carson were there, talking together
lowly and solemnly. Then Mr. Carson bade farewell and left the house;
and Job said aloud, but as if speaking to himself,

"God has heard that man's prayer. He has comforted him."




CHAPTER XXXVI.

JEM'S INTERVIEW WITH MR. DUNCOMBE.


   "The first dark day of nothingness,
   The last of danger and distress."

   BYRON.


Although Mary had hardly been conscious of her thoughts, and it had
been more like a secret instinct informing her soul, than the result
of any process of reasoning, she had felt for some time (ever since
her return from Liverpool, in fact), that for her father there was
but one thing to be desired and anticipated, and that was death!

She had seen that Conscience had given the mortal wound to his
earthly frame; she did not dare to question of the infinite mercy of
God, what the Future Life would be to him.

Though at first desolate and stunned by the blow which had fallen on
herself, she was resigned and submissive as soon as she recovered
strength enough to ponder and consider a little; and you may be
sure that no tenderness or love was wanting on Jem's part, and no
consideration and sympathy on that of Job and Margaret, to soothe
and comfort the girl who now stood alone in the world as far as
blood-relations were concerned.

She did not ask or care to know what arrangements they were making
in whispered tones with regard to the funeral. She put herself into
their hands with the trust of a little child; glad to be undisturbed
in the reveries and remembrances which filled her eyes with tears,
and caused them to fall quietly down her pale cheeks.

It was the longest day she had ever known in her life; every charge
and every occupation was taken away from her: but perhaps the length
of quiet time thus afforded was really good, although its duration
weighed upon her; for by this means she contemplated her situation in
every light, and fully understood that the morning's event had left
her an orphan; and thus she was spared the pangs caused to us by the
occurrence of death in the evening, just before we should naturally,
in the usual course of events, lie down to slumber. For in such case,
worn out by anxiety, and it may be by much watching, our very excess
of grief rocks itself to sleep, before we have had time to realise
its cause; and we waken, with a start of agony like a fresh stab, to
the consciousness of the one awful vacancy, which shall never, while
the world endures, be filled again.

The day brought its burden of duty to Mrs. Wilson. She felt bound
by regard, as well as by etiquette, to go and see her future
daughter-in-law. And by an old association of ideas (perhaps of death
with church-yards, and churches with Sunday) she thought it necessary
to put on her best, and latterly unused clothes, the airing of which
on a little clothes-horse before the fire seemed to give her a not
unpleasing occupation.

When Jem returned home late in the evening succeeding John Barton's
death, weary and oppressed with the occurrences and excitements
of the day, he found his mother busy about her mourning, and much
inclined to talk. Although he longed for quiet, he could not avoid
sitting down and answering her questions.

"Well, Jem, he's gone at last, is he?"

"Yes. How did you hear, mother?"

"Oh, Job came over here and telled me, on his way to the
undertaker's. Did he make a fine end?"

It struck Jem that she had not heard of the confession which had
been made by John Barton on his death-bed; he remembered Job Legh's
discretion, and he determined that if it could be avoided his mother
should never hear of it. Many of the difficulties to be anticipated
in preserving the secret would be obviated, if he could induce his
mother to fall into the plan he had named to Mary of emigrating to
Canada. The reasons which rendered this secrecy desirable related
to the domestic happiness he hoped for. With his mother's irritable
temper he could hardly expect that all allusion to the crime of John
Barton would be for ever restrained from passing her lips, and he
knew the deep trial such references would be to Mary. Accordingly he
resolved as soon as possible in the morning to go to Job and beseech
his silence; he trusted that secrecy in that quarter, even if the
knowledge had been extended to Margaret, might be easily secured.

But what would be Mr. Carson's course? Were there any means by which
he might be persuaded to spare John Barton's memory?

He was roused up from this train of thought by his mother's more
irritated tone of voice.

"Jem!" she was saying, "thou might'st just as well never be at a
death-bed again, if thou cannot bring off more news about it; here
have I been by mysel all day (except when oud Job came in), but
thinks I, when Jem comes he'll be sure to be good company, seeing
he was in the house at the very time of the death; and here thou
art, without a word to throw at a dog, much less thy mother: it's no
use thy going to a death-bed if thou cannot carry away any of the
sayings!"

"He did not make any, mother," replied Jem.

"Well, to be sure! So fond as he used to be of holding forth, to miss
such a fine opportunity that will never come again! Did he die easy?"

"He was very restless all night long," said Jem, reluctantly
returning to the thoughts of that time.

"And in course thou plucked the pillow away? Thou didst not! Well!
with thy bringing up, and thy learning, thou might'st have known that
were the only help in such a case. There were pigeons' feathers in
the pillow, depend on't. To think of two grown-up folk like you and
Mary, not knowing death could never come easy to a person lying on a
pillow with pigeons' feathers in!"

Jem was glad to escape from all this talking to the solitude and
quiet of his own room, where he could lie and think uninterruptedly
of what had happened and remained to be done.

The first thing was to seek an interview with Mr. Duncombe, his
former master. Accordingly, early the next morning Jem set off on his
walk to the works, where for so many years his days had been spent;
where for so long a time his thoughts had been thought, his hopes and
fears experienced. It was not a cheering feeling to remember that
henceforward he was to be severed from all these familiar places; nor
were his spirits enlivened by the evident feelings of the majority of
those who had been his fellow-workmen. As he stood in the entrance to
the foundry, awaiting Mr. Duncombe's leisure, many of those employed
in the works passed him on their return from breakfast; and with one
or two exceptions, without any acknowledgment of former acquaintance
beyond a distant nod at the utmost.

"It is hard," said Jem to himself, with a bitter and indignant
feeling rising in his throat, "that let a man's life be what it may,
folk are so ready to credit the first word against him. I could live
it down if I stayed in England; but then what would not Mary have to
bear? Sooner or later the truth would out; and then she would be a
show to folk for many a day as John Barton's daughter. Well! God does
not judge as hardly as man, that's one comfort for all of us!"

Mr. Duncombe did not believe in Jem's guilt, in spite of the silence
in which he again this day heard the imputation of it; but he agreed
that under the circumstances it was better he should leave the
country.

"We have been written to by government, as I think I told you
before, to recommend an intelligent man, well acquainted with
mechanics, as instrument-maker to the Agricultural College they
are establishing at Toronto, in Canada. It is a comfortable
appointment,--house,--land,--and a good per-centage on the
instruments made. I will show you the particulars if I can lay my
hand on the letter, which I believe I must have left at home."

"Thank you, sir. No need for seeing the letter to say I'll accept it.
I must leave Manchester; and I'd as lief quit England at once when
I'm about it."

"Of course government will give you your passage; indeed, I believe
an allowance would be made for a family if you had one; but you are
not a married man, I believe?"

"No, sir, but--" Jem hung back from a confession with the awkwardness
of a girl.

"But--" said Mr. Duncombe, smiling, "you would like to be a married
man before you go, I suppose; eh, Wilson?"

"If you please, sir. And there's my mother, too. I hope she'll go
with us. But I can pay her passage; no need to trouble government."

"Nay, nay! I'll write to-day and recommend you; and say that you have
a family of two. They'll never ask if the family goes upwards or
downwards. I shall see you again before you sail, I hope, Wilson;
though I believe they'll not allow you long to wait. Come to my house
next time; you'll find it pleasanter, I daresay. These men are so
wrong-headed. Keep up your heart!"

Jem felt that it was a relief to have this point settled; and that he
need no longer weigh reasons for and against his emigration.

And with his path growing clearer and clearer before him the longer
he contemplated it, he went to see Mary, and if he judged it fit, to
tell her what he had decided upon. Margaret was sitting with her.

"Grandfather wants to see you!" said she to Jem on his entrance.

"And I want to see him," replied Jem, suddenly remembering his last
night's determination to enjoin secrecy on Job Legh.

So he hardly stayed to kiss poor Mary's sweet woe-begone face, but
tore himself away from his darling to go to the old man, who awaited
him impatiently.

"I've getten a note from Mr. Carson," exclaimed Job the moment he saw
Jem; "and man-alive, he wants to see thee and me! For sure, there's
no more mischief up, is there?" said he, looking at Jem with an
expression of wonder. But if any suspicion mingled for an instant
with the thoughts that crossed Job's mind, it was immediately
dispelled by Jem's honest, fearless, open countenance.

"I can't guess what he's wanting, poor old chap," answered he. "May
be there's some point he's not yet satisfied on; may be--but it's no
use guessing; let's be off."

"It wouldn't be better for thee to be scarce a bit, would it, and
leave me to go and find out what's up? He has, perhaps, getten some
crotchet into his head thou'rt an accomplice, and is laying a trap
for thee."

"I'm not afeared!" said Jem; "I've done nought wrong, and know nought
wrong, about yon poor dead lad; though I'll own I had evil thoughts
once on a time. Folk can't mistake long if once they'll search into
the truth. I'll go and give the old gentleman all the satisfaction in
my power, now it can injure no one. I'd my own reasons for wanting to
see him besides, and it all falls in right enough for me."

Job was a little reassured by Jem's boldness; but still, if the truth
must be told, he wished the young man would follow his advice, and
leave him to sound Mr. Carson's intentions.

Meanwhile Jane Wilson had donned her Sunday suit of black, and set
off on her errand of condolence. She felt nervous and uneasy at the
idea of the moral sayings and texts which she fancied were expected
from visitors on occasions like the present; and prepared many a good
set speech as she walked towards the house of mourning.

As she gently opened the door, Mary, sitting idly by the fire, caught
a glimpse of her,--of Jem's mother,--of the early friend of her dead
parents,--of the kind minister to many a little want in days of
childhood,--and rose and came and fell about her neck, with many a
sob and moan, saying,

"Oh, he's gone--he's dead--all gone--all dead, and I am left alone!"

"Poor wench! poor, poor wench!" said Jane Wilson, tenderly kissing
her. "Thou'rt not alone, so donnot take on so. I'll say nought of Him
who's above, for thou know'st He is ever the orphan's friend; but
think on Jem! nay, Mary, dear, think on me! I'm but a frabbit woman
at times, but I've a heart within me through all my temper, and thou
shalt be as a daughter henceforward,--as mine own ewe-lamb. Jem shall
not love thee better in his way, than I will in mine; and thou'lt
bear with my turns, Mary, knowing that in my soul God sees the love
that shall ever be thine, if thou'lt take me for thy mother, and
speak no more of being alone."

Mrs. Wilson was weeping herself long before she had ended this
speech, which was so different to all she had planned to say, and
from all the formal piety she had laid in store for the visit; for
this was heart's piety, and needed no garnish of texts to make it
true religion, pure and undefiled.

They sat together on the same chair, their arms encircling each
other; they wept for the same dead; they had the same hope, and
trust, and overflowing love in the living.

From that time forward, hardly a passing cloud dimmed the happy
confidence of their intercourse; even by Jem would his mother's
temper sooner be irritated than by Mary; before the latter she
repressed her occasional nervous ill-humour till the habit of
indulging it was perceptibly decreased.

Years afterwards in conversation with Jem, he was startled by a
chance expression which dropped from his mother's lips; it implied a
knowledge of John Barton's crime. It was many a long day since they
had seen any Manchester people who could have revealed the secret
(if indeed it was known in Manchester, against which Jem had guarded
in every possible way). And he was led to inquire first as to the
extent, and then as to the source of her knowledge. It was Mary
herself who had told all.

For on the morning to which this chapter principally relates, as Mary
sat weeping, and as Mrs. Wilson comforted her by every tenderest word
and caress, she revealed to the dismayed and astonished Jane, the
sting of her deep sorrow; the crime which stained her dead father's
memory.

She was quite unconscious that Jem had kept it secret from his
mother; she had imagined it bruited abroad as the suspicion against
her lover had been; so word after word (dropped from her lips in the
supposition that Mrs. Wilson knew all) had told the tale and revealed
the cause of her deep anguish; deeper than is ever caused by Death
alone.

On large occasions like the present, Mrs. Wilson's innate generosity
came out. Her weak and ailing frame imparted its irritation to her
conduct in small things, and daily trifles; but she had deep and
noble sympathy with great sorrows, and even at the time that Mary
spoke she allowed no expression of surprise or horror to escape her
lips. She gave way to no curiosity as to the untold details; she was
as secret and trustworthy as her son himself; and if in years to come
her anger was occasionally excited against Mary, and she, on rare
occasions, yielded to ill-temper against her daughter-in-law, she
would upbraid her for extravagance, or stinginess, or over-dressing,
or under-dressing, or too much mirth or too much gloom, but never,
never in her most uncontrolled moments did she allude to any one of
the circumstances relating to Mary's flirtation with Harry Carson,
or his murderer; and always when she spoke of John Barton, named
him with the respect due to his conduct before the last, miserable,
guilty month of his life.

Therefore it came like a blow to Jem when, after years had passed
away, he gathered his mother's knowledge of the whole affair. From
the day when he learnt (not without remorse) what hidden depths of
self-restraint she had in her soul, his manner to her, always tender
and respectful, became reverential; and it was more than ever a
loving strife between him and Mary which should most contribute
towards the happiness of the declining years of their mother.

But I am speaking of the events which have occurred only lately,
while I have yet many things to tell you that happened six or seven
years ago.




CHAPTER XXXVII.

DETAILS CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER.


   "The rich man dines, while the poor man pines,
     And eats his heart away;
   'They teach us lies,' he sternly cries,
     'Would _brothers_ do as they?'"

   "THE DREAM."


Mr. Carson stood at one of the breathing-moments of life. The object
of the toils, the fears, and the wishes of his past years, was
suddenly hidden from his sight,--vanished into the deep mystery
which circumscribes existence. Nay, even the vengeance which he had
proposed to himself as an aim for exertion, had been taken away from
before his eyes, as by the hand of God.

Events like these would have startled the most thoughtless into
reflection, much more such a man as Mr. Carson, whose mind, if
not enlarged, was energetic; indeed, whose very energy, having
been hitherto the cause of the employment of his powers in only
one direction, had prevented him from becoming largely and
philosophically comprehensive in his views.

But now the foundations of his past life were razed to the ground,
and the place they had once occupied was sown with salt, to be for
ever rebuilt no more. It was like the change from this Life to that
other hidden one, when so many of the motives which have actuated
all our earthly existence, will have become more fleeting than the
shadows of a dream. With a wrench of his soul from the past, so
much of which was as nothing, and worse than nothing to him now, Mr.
Carson took some hours, after he had witnessed the death of his son's
murderer, to consider his situation.

But suddenly, while he was deliberating, and searching for motives
which should be effective to compel him to exertion and action
once more; while he contemplated the desire after riches, social
distinction, a name among the merchant-princes amidst whom he moved,
and saw these false substances fade away into the shadows they truly
are, and one by one disappear into the grave of his son,--suddenly,
I say, the thought arose within him that more yet remained to be
learned about the circumstances and feelings which had prompted John
Barton's crime; and when once this mournful curiosity was excited,
it seemed to gather strength in every moment that its gratification
was delayed. Accordingly he sent a message to summon Job Legh and
Jem Wilson, from whom he promised himself some elucidation of what
was as yet unexplained; while he himself set forth to call on Mr.
Bridgenorth, whom he knew to have been Jem's attorney, with a
glimmering suspicion intruding on his mind, which he strove to repel,
that Jem might have had some share in his son's death.

He had returned before his summoned visitors arrived; and had time
enough to recur to the evening on which John Barton had made his
confession. He remembered with mortification how he had forgotten
his proud reserve, and his habitual concealment of his feelings, and
had laid bare his agony of grief in the presence of these two men
who were coming to see him by his desire; and he entrenched himself
behind stiff barriers of self-control, through which he hoped no
appearance of emotion would force its way in the conversation he
anticipated.

Nevertheless, when the servant announced that two men were there by
appointment to speak to him, and he had desired that they might be
shown into the library where he sat, any watcher might have perceived
by the trembling hands, and shaking head, not only how much he was
aged by the occurrences of the last few weeks, but also how much he
was agitated at the thought of the impending interview.

But he so far succeeded in commanding himself at first, as to appear
to Jem Wilson and Job Legh one of the hardest and most haughty men
they had ever spoken to, and to forfeit all the interest which he had
previously excited in their minds by his unreserved display of deep
and genuine feeling.

When he had desired them to be seated, he shaded his face with his
hand for an instant before speaking.

"I have been calling on Mr. Bridgenorth this morning," said he, at
last; "as I expected, he can give me but little satisfaction on some
points respecting the occurrence on the 18th of last month which I
desire to have cleared up. Perhaps you two can tell me what I want
to know. As intimate friends of Barton's you probably know, or can
conjecture a good deal. Have no scruple as to speaking the truth.
What you say in this room shall never be named again by me. Besides,
you are aware that the law allows no one to be tried twice for the
same offence."

He stopped for a minute, for the mere act of speaking was fatiguing
to him after the excitement of the last few weeks.

Job Legh took the opportunity of speaking.

"I'm not going to be affronted either for myself or Jem at what
you've just now been saying about the truth. You don't know us, and
there's an end on't; only it's as well for folk to think others good
and true until they're proved contrary. Ask what you like, sir, I'll
answer for it we'll either tell truth or hold our tongues."

"I beg your pardon," said Mr. Carson, slightly bowing his head. "What
I wished to know was," referring to a slip of paper he held in his
hand, and shaking so much he could hardly adjust his glasses to his
eyes, "whether you, Wilson, can explain how Barton came possessed of
your gun. I believe you refused this explanation to Mr. Bridgenorth."

"I did, sir! If I had said what I knew then, I saw it would criminate
Barton, and so I refused telling aught. To you, sir, now I will tell
every thing and any thing; only it is but little. The gun was my
father's before it was mine, and long ago he and John Barton had a
fancy for shooting at the gallery; and they used always to take this
gun, and brag that though it was old-fashioned it was sure."

Jem saw with self-upbraiding pain how Mr. Carson winced at these last
words, but at each irrepressible and involuntary evidence of feeling,
the hearts of the two men warmed towards him. Jem went on speaking.

"One day in the week--I think it was on the Wednesday,--yes, it
was,--it was on St. Patrick's day, I met John just coming out of our
house, as I were going to my dinner. Mother was out, and he'd found
no one in. He said he'd come to borrow the old gun, and that he'd
have made bold, and taken it, but it was not to be seen. Mother was
afraid of it, so after father's death (for while he were alive, she
seemed to think he could manage it) I had carried it to my own room.
I went up and fetched it for John, who stood outside the door all the
time."

"What did he say he wanted it for?" asked Mr. Carson, hastily.

"I don't think he spoke when I gave it him. At first he muttered
something about the shooting-gallery, and I never doubted but that it
were for practice there, as I knew he had done years before."

Mr. Carson had strung up his frame to an attitude of upright
attention while Jem was speaking; now the tension relaxed, and he
sank back in his chair, weak and powerless.

He rose up again, however, as Jem went on, anxious to give every
particular which could satisfy the bereaved father.

"I never knew for what he wanted the gun till I was taken up,--I do
not know yet why he wanted it. No one would have had me get out of
the scrape by implicating an old friend,--my father's old friend, and
the father of the girl I loved. So I refused to tell Mr. Bridgenorth
aught about it, and would not have named it now to any one but you."

Jem's face became very red at the allusion he made to Mary, but
his honest, fearless eyes had met Mr. Carson's penetrating gaze
unflinchingly, and had carried conviction of his innocence and
truthfulness. Mr. Carson felt certain that he had heard all that Jem
could tell. Accordingly he turned to Job Legh.

"You were in the room the whole time while Barton was speaking to me,
I think?"

"Yes, sir," answered Job.

"You'll excuse my asking plain and direct questions; the information
I am gaining is really a relief to my mind, I don't know how, but it
is,--will you tell me if you had any idea of Barton's guilt in this
matter before?"

"None whatever, so help me God!" said Job, solemnly. "To tell truth
(and axing your forgiveness, Jem), I had never got quite shut of the
notion that Jem here had done it. At times I was as clear of his
innocence as I was of my own; and whenever I took to reasoning about
it, I saw he could not have been the man that did it. Still I never
thought of Barton."

"And yet by his confession he must have been absent at the time,"
said Mr. Carson, referring to his slip of paper.

"Ay, and for many a day after,--I can't rightly say how long. But
still, you see, one's often blind to many a thing that lies right
under one's nose, till it's pointed out. And till I heard what John
Barton had to say yon night, I could not have seen what reason he had
for doing it; while in the case of Jem, any one who looked at Mary
Barton might have seen a cause for jealousy, clear enough."

"Then you believe that Barton had no knowledge of my son's
unfortunate,--" he looked at Jem, "of his attentions to Mary Barton.
This young man, Wilson, had heard of them, you see."

"The person who told me said clearly she neither had, nor would tell
Mary's father," interposed Jem. "I don't believe he'd ever heard of
it; he weren't a man to keep still in such a matter, if he had."

"Besides," said Job, "the reason he gave on his death-bed, so to
speak, was enough; 'specially to those who knew him."

"You mean his feelings regarding the treatment of the workmen by the
masters; you think he acted from motives of revenge, in consequence
of the part my son had taken in putting down the strike?"

"Well, sir," replied Job, "it's hard to say: John Barton was not a
man to take counsel with people; nor did he make many words about his
doings. So I can only judge from his way of thinking and talking in
general, never having heard him breathe a syllable concerning this
matter in particular. You see he were sadly put about to make great
riches and great poverty square with Christ's Gospel"--Job paused, in
order to try and express what was clear enough in his own mind, as to
the effect produced on John Barton by the great and mocking contrasts
presented by the varieties of human condition. Before he could find
suitable words to explain his meaning, Mr. Carson spoke.

"You mean he was an Owenite; all for equality and community of goods,
and that kind of absurdity."

"No, no! John Barton was no fool. No need to tell him that were
all men equal to-night, some would get the start by rising an hour
earlier to-morrow. Nor yet did he care for goods, nor wealth--no man
less, so that he could get daily bread for him and his; but what hurt
him sore, and rankled in him as long as I knew him (and, sir, it
rankles in many a poor man's heart far more than the want of any
creature-comforts, and puts a sting into starvation itself), was that
those who wore finer clothes, and eat better food, and had more money
in their pockets, kept him at arm's length, and cared not whether his
heart was sorry or glad; whether he lived or died,--whether he was
bound for heaven or hell. It seemed hard to him that a heap of gold
should part him and his brother so far asunder. For he was a loving
man before he grew mad with seeing such as he was slighted, as if
Christ Himself had not been poor. At one time, I've heard him say, he
felt kindly towards every man, rich or poor, because he thought they
were all men alike. But latterly he grew aggravated with the sorrows
and suffering that he saw, and which he thought the masters might
help if they would."

"That's the notion you've all of you got," said Mr. Carson. "Now,
how in the world can we help it? We cannot regulate the demand for
labour. No man or set of men can do it. It depends on events which
God alone can control. When there is no market for our goods, we
suffer just as much as you can do."

"Not as much, I'm sure, sir; though I'm not given to Political
Economy, I know that much. I'm wanting in learning, I'm aware; but I
can use my eyes. I never see the masters getting thin and haggard for
want of food; I hardly ever see them making much change in their way
of living, though I don't doubt they've got to do it in bad times.
But it's in things for show they cut short; while for such as me,
it's in things for life we've to stint. For sure, sir, you'll own
it's come to a hard pass when a man would give aught in the world for
work to keep his children from starving, and can't get a bit, if he's
ever so willing to labour. I'm not up to talking as John Barton would
have done, but that's clear to me at any rate."

"My good man, just listen to me. Two men live in solitude; one
produces loaves of bread, the other coats,--or what you will. Now,
would it not be hard if the bread-producer were forced to give bread
for the coats, whether he wanted them or not, in order to furnish
employment to the other? That is the simple form of the case; you've
only to multiply the numbers. There will come times of great changes
in the occupation of thousands, when improvements in manufactures and
machinery are made.--It's all nonsense talking,--it must be so!"

Job Legh pondered a few moments.

"It's true it was a sore time for the hand-loom weavers when
power-looms came in: them new-fangled things make a man's life like a
lottery; and yet I'll never misdoubt that power-looms, and railways,
and all such-like inventions, are the gifts of God. I have lived long
enough, too, to see that it is part of His plan to send suffering to
bring out a higher good; but surely it's also part of His plan that
as much of the burden of the suffering as can be, should be lightened
by those whom it is His pleasure to make happy, and content in their
own circumstances. Of course it would take a deal more thought and
wisdom than me, or any other man has, to settle out of hand how this
should be done. But I'm clear about this, when God gives a blessing
to be enjoyed, He gives it with a duty to be done; and the duty of
the happy is to help the suffering to bear their woe."

"Still, facts have proved and are daily proving how much better it is
for every man to be independent of help, and self-reliant," said Mr.
Carson, thoughtfully.

"You can never work facts as you would fixed quantities, and say,
given two facts, and the product is so and so. God has given men
feelings and passions which cannot be worked into the problem,
because they are for ever changing and uncertain. God has also made
some weak; not in any one way, but in all. One is weak in body,
another in mind, another in steadiness of purpose, a fourth can't
tell right from wrong, and so on; or if he can tell the right, he
wants strength to hold by it. Now to my thinking, them that is strong
in any of God's gifts is meant to help the weak,--be hanged to the
facts! I ask your pardon, sir; I can't rightly explain the meaning
that is in me. I'm like a tap as won't run, but keeps letting it
out drop by drop, so that you've no notion of the force of what's
within."

Job looked and felt very sorrowful at the want of power in his words,
while the feeling within him was so strong and clear.

"What you say is very true, no doubt," replied Mr. Carson; "but
how would you bring it to bear upon the masters' conduct,--on my
particular case?" added he, gravely.

"I'm not learned enough to argue. Thoughts come into my head that
I'm sure are as true as Gospel, though may be they don't follow each
other like the Q. E. D. of a Proposition. The masters has it on their
own conscience,--you have it on yours, sir, to answer for to God
whether you've done, and are doing all in your power to lighten the
evils that seem always to hang on the trades by which you make your
fortunes. It's no business of mine, thank God. John Barton took the
question in hand, and his answer to it was NO! Then he grew bitter,
and angry, and mad; and in his madness he did a great sin, and
wrought a great woe; and repented him with tears as of blood; and
will go through his penance humbly and meekly in t'other place,
I'll be bound. I never seed such bitter repentance as his that last
night."

There was a silence of many minutes. Mr. Carson had covered his face,
and seemed utterly forgetful of their presence; and yet they did not
like to disturb him by rising to leave the room.

At last he said, without meeting their sympathetic eyes,

"Thank you both for coming,--and for speaking candidly to me. I fear,
Legh, neither you nor I have convinced each other, as to the power,
or want of power, in the masters to remedy the evils the men complain
of."

"I'm loth to vex you, sir, just now; but it was not the want of
power I was talking on; what we all feel sharpest is the want of
inclination to try and help the evils which come like blights at
times over the manufacturing places, while we see the masters can
stop work and not suffer. If we saw the masters try for our sakes to
find a remedy,--even if they were long about it,--even if they could
find no help, and at the end of all could only say, 'Poor fellows,
our hearts are sore for ye; we've done all we could, and can't find
a cure,'--we'd bear up like men through bad times. No one knows till
they've tried, what power of bearing lies in them, if once they
believe that men are caring for their sorrows and will help if they
can. If fellow-creatures can give nought but tears and brave words,
we take our trials straight from God, and we know enough of His love
to put ourselves blind into His hands. You say our talk has done no
good. I say it has. I see the view you take of things from the place
where you stand. I can remember that, when the time comes for judging
you; I sha'n't think any longer, does he act right on my views of a
thing, but does he act right on his own. It has done me good in that
way. I'm an old man, and may never see you again; but I'll pray for
you, and think on you and your trials, both of your great wealth, and
of your son's cruel death, many and many a day to come; and I'll ask
God to bless both to you now and for evermore. Amen. Farewell!"

Jem had maintained a manly and dignified reserve ever since he had
made his open statement of all he knew. Now both the men rose and
bowed low, looking at Mr. Carson with the deep human interest they
could not fail to take in one who had endured and forgiven a deep
injury; and who struggled hard, as it was evident he did, to bear up
like a man under his affliction.

He bowed low in return to them. Then he suddenly came forward and
shook them by the hand; and thus, without a word more, they parted.

There are stages in the contemplation and endurance of great sorrow,
which endow men with the same earnestness and clearness of thought
that in some of old took the form of Prophecy. To those who have
large capability of loving and suffering, united with great power of
firm endurance, there comes a time in their woe, when they are lifted
out of the contemplation of their individual case into a searching
inquiry into the nature of their calamity, and the remedy (if remedy
there be) which may prevent its recurrence to others as well as to
themselves.

Hence the beautiful, noble efforts which are from time to time
brought to light, as being continuously made by those who have once
hung on the cross of agony, in order that others may not suffer as
they have done; one of the grandest ends which sorrow can accomplish;
the sufferer wrestling with God's messenger until a blessing is left
behind, not for one alone but for generations.

It took time before the stern nature of Mr. Carson was compelled to
the recognition of this secret of comfort, and that same sternness
prevented his reaping any benefit in public estimation from the
actions he performed; for the character is more easily changed than
the habits and manners originally formed by that character, and to
his dying day Mr. Carson was considered hard and cold by those who
only casually saw him, or superficially knew him. But those who were
admitted into his confidence were aware, that the wish which lay
nearest to his heart was that none might suffer from the cause from
which he had suffered; that a perfect understanding, and complete
confidence and love, might exist between masters and men; that
the truth might be recognised that the interests of one were the
interests of all, and as such, required the consideration and
deliberation of all; that hence it was most desirable to have
educated workers, capable of judging, not mere machines of ignorant
men; and to have them bound to their employers by the ties of respect
and affection, not by mere money bargains alone; in short, to
acknowledge the Spirit of Christ as the regulating law between both
parties.

Many of the improvements now in practice in the system of employment
in Manchester, owe their origin to short, earnest sentences spoken
by Mr. Carson. Many and many yet to be carried into execution, take
their birth from that stern, thoughtful mind, which submitted to be
taught by suffering.




CHAPTER XXXVIII.

CONCLUSION.


   "Touch us gently, gentle Time!
     We've not proud nor soaring wings,
   Our ambition, our content,
     Lies in simple things;
   Humble voyagers are we
   O'er life's dim unsounded sea;
     Touch us gently, gentle Time!"

   BARRY CORNWALL.


Not many days after John Barton's funeral was over, all was arranged
respecting Jem's appointment at Toronto; and the time was fixed
for his sailing. It was to take place almost immediately: yet much
remained to be done; many domestic preparations were to be made; and
one great obstacle, anticipated by both Jem and Mary, to be removed.
This was the opposition they expected from Mrs. Wilson, to whom the
plan had never yet been named.

They were most anxious that their home should continue ever to be
hers, yet they feared that her dislike to a new country might be
an insuperable objection to this. At last Jem took advantage of an
evening of unusual placidity, as he sat alone with his mother just
before going to bed, to broach the subject; and to his surprise she
acceded willingly to his proposition of her accompanying himself and
his wife.

"To be sure 'Merica is a long way to flit to; beyond London a good
bit I reckon; and quite in foreign parts; but I've never had no
opinion of England, ever since they could be such fools as take up a
quiet chap like thee, and clap thee in prison. Where you go, I'll go.
Perhaps in them Indian countries they'll know a well-behaved lad when
they see him; ne'er speak a word more, lad, I'll go."

Their path became daily more smooth and easy; the present was clear
and practicable, the future was hopeful; they had leisure of mind
enough to turn to the past.

"Jem!" said Mary to him, one evening as they sat in the twilight,
talking together in low happy voices till Margaret should come to
keep Mary company through the night, "Jem! you've never yet told
me how you came to know about my naughty ways with poor young Mr.
Carson." She blushed for shame at the remembrance of her folly, and
hid her head on his shoulder while he made answer.

"Darling, I'm almost loth to tell you; your aunt Esther told me."

"Ah, I remember! but how did she know? I was so put about that night
I did not think of asking her. Where did you see her? I've forgotten
where she lives."

Mary said all this in so open and innocent a manner, that Jem felt
sure she knew not the truth respecting Esther, and he half hesitated
to tell her. At length he replied,

"Where did you see Esther lately? When? Tell me, love, for you've
never named it before, and I can't make it out."

"Oh! it was that horrible night which is like a dream." And she told
him of Esther's midnight visit, concluding with, "We must go and see
her before we leave, though I don't rightly know where to find her."

"Dearest Mary,--"

"What, Jem?" exclaimed she, alarmed by his hesitation.

"Your poor aunt Esther has no home:--she's one of them miserable
creatures that walk the streets." And he in his turn told of his
encounter with Esther, with so many details that Mary was forced to
be convinced, although her heart rebelled against the belief.

"Jem, lad!" said she, vehemently, "we must find her out,--we must
hunt her up!" She rose as if she was going on the search there and
then.

"What could we do, darling?" asked he, fondly restraining her.

"Do! Why! what could we _not_ do, if we could but find her? She's
none so happy in her ways, think ye, but what she'd turn from them,
if any one would lend her a helping hand. Don't hold me, Jem; this
is just the time for such as her to be out, and who knows but what
I might find her close at hand."

"Stay, Mary, for a minute; I'll go out now and search for her if you
wish, though it's but a wild chase. You must not go. It would be
better to ask the police to-morrow. But if I should find her, how can
I make her come with me? Once before she refused, and said she could
not break off her drinking ways, come what might?"

"You never will persuade her if you fear and doubt," said Mary, in
tears. "Hope yourself, and trust to the good that must be in her.
Speak to that,--she has it in her yet,--oh, bring her home, and we
will love her so, we'll make her good."

"Yes!" said Jem, catching Mary's sanguine spirit; "she shall go to
America with us; and we'll help her to get rid of her sins. I'll go
now, my precious darling, and if I can't find her, it's but trying
the police to-morrow. Take care of your own sweet self, Mary," said
he, fondly kissing her before he went out.

It was not to be. Jem wandered far and wide that night, but never
met Esther. The next day he applied to the police; and at last they
recognised under his description of her, a woman known to them
under the name of the "Butterfly," from the gaiety of her dress
a year or two ago. By their help he traced out one of her haunts,
a low lodging-house behind Peter Street. He and his companion, a
kind-hearted policeman, were admitted, suspiciously enough, by the
landlady, who ushered them into a large garret where twenty or
thirty people of all ages and both sexes lay and dozed away the day,
choosing the evening and night for their trades of beggary, thieving,
or prostitution.

"I know the Butterfly was here," said she, looking round. "She came
in, the night before last, and said she had not a penny to get a
place for shelter; and that if she was far away in the country she
could steal aside and die in a copse, or a clough, like the wild
animals; but here the police would let no one alone in the streets,
and she wanted a spot to die in, in peace. It's a queer sort of peace
we have here, but that night the room was uncommon empty, and I'm not
a hard-hearted woman (I wish I were, I could ha' made a good thing
out of it afore this if I were harder), so I sent her up,--but she's
not here now, I think."

"Was she very bad?" asked Jem.

"Ay! nought but skin and bone, with a cough to tear her in two."

They made some inquiries, and found that in the restlessness of
approaching death, she had longed to be once more in the open air,
and had gone forth,--where, no one seemed to be able to tell.

Leaving many messages for her, and directions that he was to be sent
for if either the policeman or the landlady obtained any clue to her
where-abouts, Jem bent his steps towards Mary's house; for he had not
seen her all that long day of search. He told her of his proceedings
and want of success; and both were saddened at the recital, and sat
silent for some time.

After a while they began talking over their plans. In a day or two,
Mary was to give up house, and go and live for a week or so with
Job Legh, until the time of her marriage, which would take place
immediately before sailing; they talked themselves back into silence
and delicious reverie. Mary sat by Jem, his arm round her waist, her
head on his shoulder; and thought over the scenes which had passed in
that home she was so soon to leave for ever.

Suddenly she felt Jem start, and started too without knowing why; she
tried to see his countenance, but the shades of evening had deepened
so much she could read no expression there. It was turned to the
window; she looked and saw a white face pressed against the panes on
the outside, gazing intently into the dusky chamber.

While they watched, as if fascinated by the appearance, and unable to
think or stir, a film came over the bright, feverish, glittering eyes
outside, and the form sank down to the ground without a struggle of
instinctive resistance.

"It is Esther!" exclaimed they, both at once. They rushed
outside; and, fallen into what appeared simply a heap of white or
light-coloured clothes, fainting or dead, lay the poor crushed
Butterfly--the once innocent Esther.

She had come (as a wounded deer drags its heavy limbs once more to
the green coolness of the lair in which it was born, there to die) to
see the place familiar to her innocence, yet once again before her
death. Whether she was indeed alive or dead, they knew not now.

Job came in with Margaret, for it was bed-time. He said Esther's
pulse beat a little yet. They carried her upstairs and laid her
on Mary's bed, not daring to undress her, lest any motion should
frighten the trembling life away; but it was all in vain.

Towards midnight, she opened wide her eyes and looked around on the
once familiar room; Job Legh knelt by the bed praying aloud and
fervently for her, but he stopped as he saw her roused look. She sat
up in bed with a sudden convulsive motion.

"Has it been a dream then?" asked she wildly. Then with a habit,
which came like instinct even in that awful dying hour, her hand
sought for a locket which hung concealed in her bosom, and, finding
that, she knew all was true which had befallen her since last she lay
an innocent girl on that bed.

She fell back, and spoke word never more. She held the locket
containing her child's hair still in her hand, and once or twice she
kissed it with a long soft kiss. She cried feebly and sadly as long
as she had any strength to cry, and then she died.

They laid her in one grave with John Barton. And there they lie
without name, or initial, or date. Only this verse is inscribed upon
the stone which covers the remains of these two wanderers.

Psalm ciii. v. 9.--"For He will not always chide, neither will He
keep His anger for ever."


I see a long, low, wooden house, with room enough and to spare. The
old primeval trees are felled and gone for many a mile around; one
alone remains to overshadow the gable-end of the cottage. There is a
garden around the dwelling, and far beyond that stretches an orchard.
The glory of an Indian summer is over all, making the heart leap at
the sight of its gorgeous beauty.

At the door of the house, looking towards the town, stands Mary,
watching for the return of her husband from his daily work; and while
she watches, she listens, smiling;

   "Clap hands, daddy comes,
   With his pocket full of plums,
   And a cake for Johnnie."

Then comes a crow of delight from Johnnie. Then his grandmother
carries him to the door, and glories in seeing him resist his
mother's blandishments to cling to her.

"English letters! 'Twas that made me so late!"

"Oh, Jem, Jem! don't hold them so tight! What do they say?"

"Why, some good news. Come, give a guess what it is."

"Oh, tell me! I cannot guess," said Mary.

"Then you give it up, do you? What do you say, mother?"

Jane Wilson thought a moment.

"Will and Margaret are married?" asked she.

"Not exactly,--but very near. The old woman has twice the spirit of
the young one. Come, Mary, give a guess!"

He covered his little boy's eyes with his hands for an instant,
significantly, till the baby pushed them down, saying in his
imperfect way,

"Tan't see."

"There now! Johnnie can see. Do you guess, Mary?"

"They've done something to Margaret to give her back her sight!"
exclaimed she.

"They have. She has been couched, and can see as well as ever. She
and Will are to be married on the twenty-fifth of this month, and
he's bringing her out here next voyage; and Job Legh talks of coming
too,--not to see you, Mary,--nor you, mother,--nor you, my little
hero" (kissing him), "but to try and pick up a few specimens of
Canadian insects, Will says. All the compliment is to the earwigs,
you see, mother!"

"Dear Job Legh!" said Mary, softly and seriously.


﻿
CHAPTER I—OUR SOCIETY


IN the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the
holders of houses above a certain rent are women.  If a married couple
come to settle in the town, somehow the gentleman disappears; he is
either fairly frightened to death by being the only man in the Cranford
evening parties, or he is accounted for by being with his regiment, his
ship, or closely engaged in business all the week in the great
neighbouring commercial town of Drumble, distant only twenty miles on a
railroad.  In short, whatever does become of the gentlemen, they are not
at Cranford.  What could they do if they were there?  The surgeon has his
round of thirty miles, and sleeps at Cranford; but every man cannot be a
surgeon.  For keeping the trim gardens full of choice flowers without a
weed to speck them; for frightening away little boys who look wistfully
at the said flowers through the railings; for rushing out at the geese
that occasionally venture in to the gardens if the gates are left open;
for deciding all questions of literature and politics without troubling
themselves with unnecessary reasons or arguments; for obtaining clear and
correct knowledge of everybody’s affairs in the parish; for keeping their
neat maid-servants in admirable order; for kindness (somewhat
dictatorial) to the poor, and real tender good offices to each other
whenever they are in distress, the ladies of Cranford are quite
sufficient.  “A man,” as one of them observed to me once, “is _so_ in the
way in the house!”  Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other’s
proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other’s opinions.
Indeed, as each has her own individuality, not to say eccentricity,
pretty strongly developed, nothing is so easy as verbal retaliation; but,
somehow, good-will reigns among them to a considerable degree.

The Cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel, spirited out
in a few peppery words and angry jerks of the head; just enough to
prevent the even tenor of their lives from becoming too flat.  Their
dress is very independent of fashion; as they observe, “What does it
signify how we dress here at Cranford, where everybody knows us?”  And if
they go from home, their reason is equally cogent, “What does it signify
how we dress here, where nobody knows us?”  The materials of their
clothes are, in general, good and plain, and most of them are nearly as
scrupulous as Miss Tyler, of cleanly memory; but I will answer for it,
the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England,
was seen in Cranford—and seen without a smile.

            [Picture: A magnificent family red silk umbrella]

I can testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella, under which a
gentle little spinster, left alone of many brothers and sisters, used to
patter to church on rainy days.  Have you any red silk umbrellas in
London?  We had a tradition of the first that had ever been seen in
Cranford; and the little boys mobbed it, and called it “a stick in
petticoats.”  It might have been the very red silk one I have described,
held by a strong father over a troop of little ones; the poor little
lady—the survivor of all—could scarcely carry it.

Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls; and they
were announced to any young people who might be staying in the town, with
all the solemnity with which the old Manx laws were read once a year on
the Tinwald Mount.

“Our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey
to-night, my dear” (fifteen miles in a gentleman’s carriage); “they will
give you some rest to-morrow, but the next day, I have no doubt, they
will call; so be at liberty after twelve—from twelve to three are our
calling hours.”

Then, after they had called—

“It is the third day; I dare say your mamma has told you, my dear, never
to let more than three days elapse between receiving a call and returning
it; and also, that you are never to stay longer than a quarter of an
hour.”

“But am I to look at my watch?  How am I to find out when a quarter of an
hour has passed?”

“You must keep thinking about the time, my dear, and not allow yourself
to forget it in conversation.”

As everybody had this rule in their minds, whether they received or paid
a call, of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken about.  We kept
ourselves to short sentences of small talk, and were punctual to our
time.

I imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of Cranford were poor, and had
some difficulty in making both ends meet; but they were like the
Spartans, and concealed their smart under a smiling face.  We none of us
spoke of money, because that subject savoured of commerce and trade, and
though some might be poor, we were all aristocratic.  The Cranfordians
had that kindly _esprit de corps_ which made them overlook all
deficiencies in success when some among them tried to conceal their
poverty.  When Mrs Forrester, for instance, gave a party in her
baby-house of a dwelling, and the little maiden disturbed the ladies on
the sofa by a request that she might get the tea-tray out from
underneath, everyone took this novel proceeding as the most natural thing
in the world, and talked on about household forms and ceremonies as if we
all believed that our hostess had a regular servants’ hall, second table,
with housekeeper and steward, instead of the one little charity-school
maiden, whose short ruddy arms could never have been strong enough to
carry the tray upstairs, if she had not been assisted in private by her
mistress, who now sat in state, pretending not to know what cakes were
sent up, though she knew, and we knew, and she knew that we knew, and we
knew that she knew that we knew, she had been busy all the morning making
tea-bread and sponge-cakes.

There were one or two consequences arising from this general but
unacknowledged poverty, and this very much acknowledged gentility, which
were not amiss, and which might be introduced into many circles of
society to their great improvement.  For instance, the inhabitants of
Cranford kept early hours, and clattered home in their pattens, under the
guidance of a lantern-bearer, about nine o’clock at night; and the whole
town was abed and asleep by half-past ten.  Moreover, it was considered
“vulgar” (a tremendous word in Cranford) to give anything expensive, in
the way of eatable or drinkable, at the evening entertainments.  Wafer
bread-and-butter and sponge-biscuits were all that the Honourable Mrs
Jamieson gave; and she was sister-in-law to the late Earl of Glenmire,
although she did practise such “elegant economy.”

“Elegant economy!”  How naturally one falls back into the phraseology of
Cranford!  There, economy was always “elegant,” and money-spending always
“vulgar and ostentatious”; a sort of sour-grapeism which made us very
peaceful and satisfied.  I never shall forget the dismay felt when a
certain Captain Brown came to live at Cranford, and openly spoke about
his being poor—not in a whisper to an intimate friend, the doors and
windows being previously closed, but in the public street! in a loud
military voice! alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a
particular house.  The ladies of Cranford were already rather moaning
over the invasion of their territories by a man and a gentleman.  He was
a half-pay captain, and had obtained some situation on a neighbouring
railroad, which had been vehemently petitioned against by the little
town; and if, in addition to his masculine gender, and his connection
with the obnoxious railroad, he was so brazen as to talk of being
poor—why, then, indeed, he must be sent to Coventry.  Death was as true
and as common as poverty; yet people never spoke about that, loud out in
the streets.  It was a word not to be mentioned to ears polite.  We had
tacitly agreed to ignore that any with whom we associated on terms of
visiting equality could ever be prevented by poverty from doing anything
that they wished.  If we walked to or from a party, it was because the
night was _so_ fine, or the air _so_ refreshing, not because sedan-chairs
were expensive.  If we wore prints, instead of summer silks, it was
because we preferred a washing material; and so on, till we blinded
ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were, all of us, people of very
moderate means.  Of course, then, we did not know what to make of a man
who could speak of poverty as if it was not a disgrace.  Yet, somehow,
Captain Brown made himself respected in Cranford, and was called upon, in
spite of all resolutions to the contrary.  I was surprised to hear his
opinions quoted as authority at a visit which I paid to Cranford about a
year after he had settled in the town.  My own friends had been among the
bitterest opponents of any proposal to visit the Captain and his
daughters, only twelve months before; and now he was even admitted in the
tabooed hours before twelve.  True, it was to discover the cause of a
smoking chimney, before the fire was lighted; but still Captain Brown
walked upstairs, nothing daunted, spoke in a voice too large for the
room, and joked quite in the way of a tame man about the house.  He had
been blind to all the small slights, and omissions of trivial ceremonies,
with which he had been received.  He had been friendly, though the
Cranford ladies had been cool; he had answered small sarcastic
compliments in good faith; and with his manly frankness had overpowered
all the shrinking which met him as a man who was not ashamed to be poor.
And, at last, his excellent masculine common sense, and his facility in
devising expedients to overcome domestic dilemmas, had gained him an
extraordinary place as authority among the Cranford ladies.  He himself
went on in his course, as unaware of his popularity as he had been of the
reverse; and I am sure he was startled one day when he found his advice
so highly esteemed as to make some counsel which he had given in jest to
be taken in sober, serious earnest.

It was on this subject: An old lady had an Alderney cow, which she looked
upon as a daughter.  You could not pay the short quarter of an hour call
without being told of the wonderful milk or wonderful intelligence of
this animal.  The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betsy Barker’s
Alderney; therefore great was the sympathy and regret when, in an
unguarded moment, the poor cow tumbled into a lime-pit.  She moaned so
loudly that she was soon heard and rescued; but meanwhile the poor beast
had lost most of her hair, and came out looking naked, cold, and
miserable, in a bare skin.  Everybody pitied the animal, though a few
could not restrain their smiles at her droll appearance.  Miss Betsy
Barker absolutely cried with sorrow and dismay; and it was said she
thought of trying a bath of oil.  This remedy, perhaps, was recommended
by some one of the number whose advice she asked; but the proposal, if
ever it was made, was knocked on the head by Captain Brown’s decided “Get
her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers, ma’am, if you wish to keep
her alive.  But my advice is, kill the poor creature at once.”

Miss Betsy Barker dried her eyes, and thanked the Captain heartily; she
set to work, and by-and-by all the town turned out to see the Alderney
meekly going to her pasture, clad in dark grey flannel.  I have watched
her myself many a time.  Do you ever see cows dressed in grey flannel in
London?

                  [Picture: Meekly going to her pasture]

Captain Brown had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town, where
he lived with his two daughters.  He must have been upwards of sixty at
the time of the first visit I paid to Cranford after I had left it as a
residence.  But he had a wiry, well-trained, elastic figure, a stiff
military throw-back of his head, and a springing step, which made him
appear much younger than he was.  His eldest daughter looked almost as
old as himself, and betrayed the fact that his real was more than his
apparent age.  Miss Brown must have been forty; she had a sickly, pained,
careworn expression on her face, and looked as if the gaiety of youth had
long faded out of sight.  Even when young she must have been plain and
hard-featured.  Miss Jessie Brown was ten years younger than her sister,
and twenty shades prettier.  Her face was round and dimpled.  Miss
Jenkyns once said, in a passion against Captain Brown (the cause of which
I will tell you presently), “that she thought it was time for Miss Jessie
to leave off her dimples, and not always to be trying to look like a
child.”  It was true there was something childlike in her face; and there
will be, I think, till she dies, though she should live to a hundred.
Her eyes were large blue wondering eyes, looking straight at you; her
nose was unformed and snub, and her lips were red and dewy; she wore her
hair, too, in little rows of curls, which heightened this appearance.  I
do not know whether she was pretty or not; but I liked her face, and so
did everybody, and I do not think she could help her dimples.  She had
something of her father’s jauntiness of gait and manner; and any female
observer might detect a slight difference in the attire of the two
sisters—that of Miss Jessie being about two pounds per annum more
expensive than Miss Brown’s.  Two pounds was a large sum in Captain
Brown’s annual disbursements.

Such was the impression made upon me by the Brown family when I first saw
them all together in Cranford Church.  The Captain I had met before—on
the occasion of the smoky chimney, which he had cured by some simple
alteration in the flue.  In church, he held his double eye-glass to his
eyes during the Morning Hymn, and then lifted up his head erect and sang
out loud and joyfully.  He made the responses louder than the clerk—an
old man with a piping feeble voice, who, I think, felt aggrieved at the
Captain’s sonorous bass, and quivered higher and higher in consequence.

On coming out of church, the brisk Captain paid the most gallant
attention to his two daughters.  He nodded and smiled to his
acquaintances; but he shook hands with none until he had helped Miss
Brown to unfurl her umbrella, had relieved her of her prayer-book, and
had waited patiently till she, with trembling nervous hands, had taken up
her gown to walk through the wet roads.

I wonder what the Cranford ladies did with Captain Brown at their
parties.  We had often rejoiced, in former days, that there was no
gentleman to be attended to, and to find conversation for, at the
card-parties.  We had congratulated ourselves upon the snugness of the
evenings; and, in our love for gentility, and distaste of mankind, we had
almost persuaded ourselves that to be a man was to be “vulgar”; so that
when I found my friend and hostess, Miss Jenkyns, was going to have a
party in my honour, and that Captain and the Miss Browns were invited, I
wondered much what would be the course of the evening.  Card-tables, with
green baize tops, were set out by daylight, just as usual; it was the
third week in November, so the evenings closed in about four.  Candles,
and clean packs of cards, were arranged on each table.  The fire was made
up; the neat maid-servant had received her last directions; and there we
stood, dressed in our best, each with a candle-lighter in our hands,
ready to dart at the candles as soon as the first knock came.  Parties in
Cranford were solemn festivities, making the ladies feel gravely elated
as they sat together in their best dresses.  As soon as three had
arrived, we sat down to “Preference,” I being the unlucky fourth.  The
next four comers were put down immediately to another table; and
presently the tea-trays, which I had seen set out in the store-room as I
passed in the morning, were placed each on the middle of a card-table.
The china was delicate egg-shell; the old-fashioned silver glittered with
polishing; but the eatables were of the slightest description.  While the
trays were yet on the tables, Captain and the Miss Browns came in; and I
could see that, somehow or other, the Captain was a favourite with all
the ladies present.  Ruffled brows were smoothed, sharp voices lowered at
his approach.  Miss Brown looked ill, and depressed almost to gloom.
Miss Jessie smiled as usual, and seemed nearly as popular as her father.
He immediately and quietly assumed the man’s place in the room; attended
to every one’s wants, lessened the pretty maid-servant’s labour by
waiting on empty cups and bread-and-butterless ladies; and yet did it all
in so easy and dignified a manner, and so much as if it were a matter of
course for the strong to attend to the weak, that he was a true man
throughout.  He played for threepenny points with as grave an interest as
if they had been pounds; and yet, in all his attention to strangers, he
had an eye on his suffering daughter—for suffering I was sure she was,
though to many eyes she might only appear to be irritable.  Miss Jessie
could not play cards: but she talked to the sitters-out, who, before her
coming, had been rather inclined to be cross.  She sang, too, to an old
cracked piano, which I think had been a spinet in its youth.  Miss Jessie
sang, “Jock of Hazeldean” a little out of tune; but we were none of us
musical, though Miss Jenkyns beat time, out of time, by way of appearing
to be so.

It was very good of Miss Jenkyns to do this; for I had seen that, a
little before, she had been a good deal annoyed by Miss Jessie Brown’s
unguarded admission (_à propos_ of Shetland wool) that she had an uncle,
her mother’s brother, who was a shop-keeper in Edinburgh.  Miss Jenkyns
tried to drown this confession by a terrible cough—for the Honourable Mrs
Jamieson was sitting at a card-table nearest Miss Jessie, and what would
she say or think if she found out she was in the same room with a
shop-keeper’s niece!  But Miss Jessie Brown (who had no tact, as we all
agreed the next morning) _would_ repeat the information, and assure Miss
Pole she could easily get her the identical Shetland wool required,
“through my uncle, who has the best assortment of Shetland goods of any
one in Edinbro’.”  It was to take the taste of this out of our mouths,
and the sound of this out of our ears, that Miss Jenkyns proposed music;
so I say again, it was very good of her to beat time to the song.

When the trays re-appeared with biscuits and wine, punctually at a
quarter to nine, there was conversation, comparing of cards, and talking
over tricks; but by-and-by Captain Brown sported a bit of literature.

“Have you seen any numbers of ‘The Pickwick Papers’?” said he.  (They
were then publishing in parts.)  “Capital thing!”

Now Miss Jenkyns was daughter of a deceased rector of Cranford; and, on
the strength of a number of manuscript sermons, and a pretty good library
of divinity, considered herself literary, and looked upon any
conversation about books as a challenge to her.  So she answered and
said, “Yes, she had seen them; indeed, she might say she had read them.”

“And what do you think of them?” exclaimed Captain Brown.  “Aren’t they
famously good?”

So urged Miss Jenkyns could not but speak.

“I must say, I don’t think they are by any means equal to Dr Johnson.
Still, perhaps, the author is young.  Let him persevere, and who knows
what he may become if he will take the great Doctor for his model?”  This
was evidently too much for Captain Brown to take placidly; and I saw the
words on the tip of his tongue before Miss Jenkyns had finished her
sentence.

“It is quite a different sort of thing, my dear madam,” he began.

“I am quite aware of that,” returned she.  “And I make allowances,
Captain Brown.”

“Just allow me to read you a scene out of this month’s number,” pleaded
he.  “I had it only this morning, and I don’t think the company can have
read it yet.”

“As you please,” said she, settling herself with an air of resignation.
He read the account of the “swarry” which Sam Weller gave at Bath.  Some
of us laughed heartily.  _I_ did not dare, because I was staying in the
house.  Miss Jenkyns sat in patient gravity.  When it was ended, she
turned to me, and said with mild dignity—

“Fetch me ‘Rasselas,’ my dear, out of the book-room.”

When I had brought it to her, she turned to Captain Brown—

“Now allow _me_ to read you a scene, and then the present company can
judge between your favourite, Mr Boz, and Dr Johnson.”

She read one of the conversations between Rasselas and Imlac, in a
high-pitched, majestic voice: and when she had ended, she said, “I
imagine I am now justified in my preference of Dr Johnson as a writer of
fiction.”  The Captain screwed his lips up, and drummed on the table, but
he did not speak.  She thought she would give him a finishing blow or
two.

         [Picture: Endeavouring to beguile her into conversation]

“I consider it vulgar, and below the dignity of literature, to publish in
numbers.”

“How was the _Rambler_ published, ma’am?” asked Captain Brown in a low
voice, which I think Miss Jenkyns could not have heard.

“Dr Johnson’s style is a model for young beginners.  My father
recommended it to me when I began to write letters—I have formed my own
style upon it; I recommended it to your favourite.”

“I should be very sorry for him to exchange his style for any such
pompous writing,” said Captain Brown.

Miss Jenkyns felt this as a personal affront, in a way of which the
Captain had not dreamed.  Epistolary writing she and her friends
considered as her _forte_.  Many a copy of many a letter have I seen
written and corrected on the slate, before she “seized the half-hour just
previous to post-time to assure” her friends of this or of that; and Dr
Johnson was, as she said, her model in these compositions.  She drew
herself up with dignity, and only replied to Captain Brown’s last remark
by saying, with marked emphasis on every syllable, “I prefer Dr Johnson
to Mr Boz.”

It is said—I won’t vouch for the fact—that Captain Brown was heard to
say, _sotto voce_, “D-n Dr Johnson!”  If he did, he was penitent
afterwards, as he showed by going to stand near Miss Jenkyns’ arm-chair,
and endeavouring to beguile her into conversation on some more pleasing
subject.  But she was inexorable.  The next day she made the remark I
have mentioned about Miss Jessie’s dimples.




CHAPTER II—THE CAPTAIN


IT was impossible to live a month at Cranford and not know the daily
habits of each resident; and long before my visit was ended I knew much
concerning the whole Brown trio.  There was nothing new to be discovered
respecting their poverty; for they had spoken simply and openly about
that from the very first.  They made no mystery of the necessity for
their being economical.  All that remained to be discovered was the
Captain’s infinite kindness of heart, and the various modes in which,
unconsciously to himself, he manifested it.  Some little anecdotes were
talked about for some time after they occurred.  As we did not read much,
and as all the ladies were pretty well suited with servants, there was a
dearth of subjects for conversation.  We therefore discussed the
circumstance of the Captain taking a poor old woman’s dinner out of her
hands one very slippery Sunday.  He had met her returning from the
bakehouse as he came from church, and noticed her precarious footing;
and, with the grave dignity with which he did everything, he relieved her
of her burden, and steered along the street by her side, carrying her
baked mutton and potatoes safely home.  This was thought very eccentric;
and it was rather expected that he would pay a round of calls, on the
Monday morning, to explain and apologise to the Cranford sense of
propriety: but he did no such thing: and then it was decided that he was
ashamed, and was keeping out of sight.  In a kindly pity for him, we
began to say, “After all, the Sunday morning’s occurrence showed great
goodness of heart,” and it was resolved that he should be comforted on
his next appearance amongst us; but, lo! he came down upon us, untouched
by any sense of shame, speaking loud and bass as ever, his head thrown
back, his wig as jaunty and well-curled as usual, and we were obliged to
conclude he had forgotten all about Sunday.

Miss Pole and Miss Jessie Brown had set up a kind of intimacy on the
strength of the Shetland wool and the new knitting stitches; so it
happened that when I went to visit Miss Pole I saw more of the Browns
than I had done while staying with Miss Jenkyns, who had never got over
what she called Captain Brown’s disparaging remarks upon Dr Johnson as a
writer of light and agreeable fiction.  I found that Miss Brown was
seriously ill of some lingering, incurable complaint, the pain occasioned
by which gave the uneasy expression to her face that I had taken for
unmitigated crossness.  Cross, too, she was at times, when the nervous
irritability occasioned by her disease became past endurance.  Miss
Jessie bore with her at these times, even more patiently than she did
with the bitter self-upbraidings by which they were invariably succeeded.
Miss Brown used to accuse herself, not merely of hasty and irritable
temper, but also of being the cause why her father and sister were
obliged to pinch, in order to allow her the small luxuries which were
necessaries in her condition.  She would so fain have made sacrifices for
them, and have lightened their cares, that the original generosity of her
disposition added acerbity to her temper.  All this was borne by Miss
Jessie and her father with more than placidity—with absolute tenderness.
I forgave Miss Jessie her singing out of tune, and her juvenility of
dress, when I saw her at home.  I came to perceive that Captain Brown’s
dark Brutus wig and padded coat (alas! too often threadbare) were
remnants of the military smartness of his youth, which he now wore
unconsciously.  He was a man of infinite resources, gained in his barrack
experience.  As he confessed, no one could black his boots to please him
except himself; but, indeed, he was not above saving the little
maid-servant’s labours in every way—knowing, most likely, that his
daughter’s illness made the place a hard one.

He endeavoured to make peace with Miss Jenkyns soon after the memorable
dispute I have named, by a present of a wooden fire-shovel (his own
making), having heard her say how much the grating of an iron one annoyed
her.  She received the present with cool gratitude, and thanked him
formally.  When he was gone, she bade me put it away in the lumber-room;
feeling, probably, that no present from a man who preferred Mr Boz to Dr
Johnson could be less jarring than an iron fire-shovel.

Such was the state of things when I left Cranford and went to Drumble.  I
had, however, several correspondents, who kept me _au fait_ as to the
proceedings of the dear little town.  There was Miss Pole, who was
becoming as much absorbed in crochet as she had been once in knitting,
and the burden of whose letter was something like, “But don’t you forget
the white worsted at Flint’s” of the old song; for at the end of every
sentence of news came a fresh direction as to some crochet commission
which I was to execute for her.  Miss Matilda Jenkyns (who did not mind
being called Miss Matty, when Miss Jenkyns was not by) wrote nice, kind,
rambling letters, now and then venturing into an opinion of her own; but
suddenly pulling herself up, and either begging me not to name what she
had said, as Deborah thought differently, and _she_ knew, or else putting
in a postscript to the effect that, since writing the above, she had been
talking over the subject with Deborah, and was quite convinced that,
etc.—(here probably followed a recantation of every opinion she had given
in the letter).  Then came Miss Jenkyns—Deborah, as she liked Miss Matty
to call her, her father having once said that the Hebrew name ought to be
so pronounced.  I secretly think she took the Hebrew prophetess for a
model in character; and, indeed, she was not unlike the stern prophetess
in some ways, making allowance, of course, for modern customs and
difference in dress.  Miss Jenkyns wore a cravat, and a little bonnet
like a jockey-cap, and altogether had the appearance of a strong-minded
woman; although she would have despised the modern idea of women being
equal to men.  Equal, indeed! she knew they were superior.  But to return
to her letters.  Everything in them was stately and grand like herself.
I have been looking them over (dear Miss Jenkyns, how I honoured her!)
and I will give an extract, more especially because it relates to our
friend Captain Brown:—

“The Honourable Mrs Jamieson has only just quitted me; and, in the course
of conversation, she communicated to me the intelligence that she had
yesterday received a call from her revered husband’s quondam friend, Lord
Mauleverer.  You will not easily conjecture what brought his lordship
within the precincts of our little town.  It was to see Captain Brown,
with whom, it appears, his lordship was acquainted in the ‘plumed wars,’
and who had the privilege of averting destruction from his lordship’s
head when some great peril was impending over it, off the misnomered Cape
of Good Hope.  You know our friend the Honourable Mrs Jamieson’s
deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity, and you will therefore
not be so much surprised when I tell you she was quite unable to disclose
to me the exact nature of the peril in question.  I was anxious, I
confess, to ascertain in what manner Captain Brown, with his limited
establishment, could receive so distinguished a guest; and I discovered
that his lordship retired to rest, and, let us hope, to refreshing
slumbers, at the Angel Hotel; but shared the Brunonian meals during the
two days that he honoured Cranford with his august presence.  Mrs
Johnson, our civil butcher’s wife, informs me that Miss Jessie purchased
a leg of lamb; but, besides this, I can hear of no preparation whatever
to give a suitable reception to so distinguished a visitor.  Perhaps they
entertained him with ‘the feast of reason and the flow of soul’; and to
us, who are acquainted with Captain Brown’s sad want of relish for ‘the
pure wells of English undefiled,’ it may be matter for congratulation
that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by holding
converse with an elegant and refined member of the British aristocracy.
But from some mundane failings who is altogether free?”

Miss Pole and Miss Matty wrote to me by the same post.  Such a piece of
news as Lord Mauleverer’s visit was not to be lost on the Cranford
letter-writers: they made the most of it.  Miss Matty humbly apologised
for writing at the same time as her sister, who was so much more capable
than she to describe the honour done to Cranford; but in spite of a
little bad spelling, Miss Matty’s account gave me the best idea of the
commotion occasioned by his lordship’s visit, after it had occurred; for,
except the people at the Angel, the Browns, Mrs Jamieson, and a little
lad his lordship had sworn at for driving a dirty hoop against the
aristocratic legs, I could not hear of any one with whom his lordship had
held conversation.

My next visit to Cranford was in the summer.  There had been neither
births, deaths, nor marriages since I was there last.  Everybody lived in
the same house, and wore pretty nearly the same well-preserved,
old-fashioned clothes.  The greatest event was, that Miss Jenkyns had
purchased a new carpet for the drawing-room.  Oh, the busy work Miss
Matty and I had in chasing the sunbeams, as they fell in an afternoon
right down on this carpet through the blindless window!  We spread
newspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work; and, lo!
in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved, and was blazing away on a
fresh spot; and down again we went on our knees to alter the position of
the newspapers.  We were very busy, too, one whole morning, before Miss
Jenkyns gave her party, in following her directions, and in cutting out
and stitching together pieces of newspaper so as to form little paths to
every chair set for the expected visitors, lest their shoes might dirty
or defile the purity of the carpet.  Do you make paper paths for every
guest to walk upon in London?

Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns were not very cordial to each other.  The
literary dispute, of which I had seen the beginning, was a “raw,” the
slightest touch on which made them wince.  It was the only difference of
opinion they had ever had; but that difference was enough.  Miss Jenkyns
could not refrain from talking at Captain Brown; and, though he did not
reply, he drummed with his fingers, which action she felt and resented as
very disparaging to Dr Johnson.  He was rather ostentatious in his
preference of the writings of Mr Boz; would walk through the streets so
absorbed in them that he all but ran against Miss Jenkyns; and though his
apologies were earnest and sincere, and though he did not, in fact, do
more than startle her and himself, she owned to me she had rather he had
knocked her down, if he had only been reading a higher style of
literature.  The poor, brave Captain! he looked older, and more worn, and
his clothes were very threadbare.  But he seemed as bright and cheerful
as ever, unless he was asked about his daughter’s health.

“She suffers a great deal, and she must suffer more: we do what we can to
alleviate her pain;—God’s will be done!”  He took off his hat at these
last words.  I found, from Miss Matty, that everything had been done, in
fact.  A medical man, of high repute in that country neighbourhood, had
been sent for, and every injunction he had given was attended to,
regardless of expense.  Miss Matty was sure they denied themselves many
things in order to make the invalid comfortable; but they never spoke
about it; and as for Miss Jessie!—“I really think she’s an angel,” said
poor Miss Matty, quite overcome.  “To see her way of bearing with Miss
Brown’s crossness, and the bright face she puts on after she’s been
sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it, is quite
beautiful.  Yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome the Captain at
breakfast-time as if she had been asleep in the Queen’s bed all night.
My dear! you could never laugh at her prim little curls or her pink bows
again if you saw her as I have done.”  I could only feel very penitent,
and greet Miss Jessie with double respect when I met her next.  She
looked faded and pinched; and her lips began to quiver, as if she was
very weak, when she spoke of her sister.  But she brightened, and sent
back the tears that were glittering in her pretty eyes, as she said—

“But, to be sure, what a town Cranford is for kindness!  I don’t suppose
any one has a better dinner than usual cooked but the best part of all
comes in a little covered basin for my sister.  The poor people will
leave their earliest vegetables at our door for her.  They speak short
and gruff, as if they were ashamed of it: but I am sure it often goes to
my heart to see their thoughtfulness.”  The tears now came back and
overflowed; but after a minute or two she began to scold herself, and
ended by going away the same cheerful Miss Jessie as ever.

“But why does not this Lord Mauleverer do something for the man who saved
his life?” said I.

“Why, you see, unless Captain Brown has some reason for it, he never
speaks about being poor; and he walked along by his lordship looking as
happy and cheerful as a prince; and as they never called attention to
their dinner by apologies, and as Miss Brown was better that day, and all
seemed bright, I daresay his lordship never knew how much care there was
in the background.  He did send game in the winter pretty often, but now
he is gone abroad.”

I had often occasion to notice the use that was made of fragments and
small opportunities in Cranford; the rose-leaves that were gathered ere
they fell to make into a potpourri for someone who had no garden; the
little bundles of lavender flowers sent to strew the drawers of some
town-dweller, or to burn in the chamber of some invalid.  Things that
many would despise, and actions which it seemed scarcely worth while to
perform, were all attended to in Cranford.  Miss Jenkyns stuck an apple
full of cloves, to be heated and smell pleasantly in Miss Brown’s room;
and as she put in each clove she uttered a Johnsonian sentence.  Indeed,
she never could think of the Browns without talking Johnson; and, as they
were seldom absent from her thoughts just then, I heard many a rolling,
three-piled sentence.

Captain Brown called one day to thank Miss Jenkyns for many little
kindnesses, which I did not know until then that she had rendered.  He
had suddenly become like an old man; his deep bass voice had a quavering
in it, his eyes looked dim, and the lines on his face were deep.  He did
not—could not—speak cheerfully of his daughter’s state, but he talked
with manly, pious resignation, and not much.  Twice over he said, “What
Jessie has been to us, God only knows!” and after the second time, he got
up hastily, shook hands all round without speaking, and left the room.

That afternoon we perceived little groups in the street, all listening
with faces aghast to some tale or other.  Miss Jenkyns wondered what
could be the matter for some time before she took the undignified step of
sending Jenny out to inquire.

Jenny came back with a white face of terror.  “Oh, ma’am!  Oh, Miss
Jenkyns, ma’am!  Captain Brown is killed by them nasty cruel railroads!”
and she burst into tears.  She, along with many others, had experienced
the poor Captain’s kindness.

“How?—where—where?  Good God!  Jenny, don’t waste time in crying, but
tell us something.”  Miss Matty rushed out into the street at once, and
collared the man who was telling the tale.

 [Picture: She brought the affrighted carter . . . into the drawing-room]

“Come in—come to my sister at once, Miss Jenkyns, the rector’s daughter.
Oh, man, man! say it is not true,” she cried, as she brought the
affrighted carter, sleeking down his hair, into the drawing-room, where
he stood with his wet boots on the new carpet, and no one regarded it.

“Please, mum, it is true.  I seed it myself,” and he shuddered at the
recollection.  “The Captain was a-reading some new book as he was deep
in, a-waiting for the down train; and there was a little lass as wanted
to come to its mammy, and gave its sister the slip, and came toddling
across the line.  And he looked up sudden, at the sound of the train
coming, and seed the child, and he darted on the line and cotched it up,
and his foot slipped, and the train came over him in no time.  O Lord,
Lord!  Mum, it’s quite true, and they’ve come over to tell his daughters.
The child’s safe, though, with only a bang on its shoulder as he threw it
to its mammy.  Poor Captain would be glad of that, mum, wouldn’t he?  God
bless him!”  The great rough carter puckered up his manly face, and
turned away to hide his tears.  I turned to Miss Jenkyns.  She looked
very ill, as if she were going to faint, and signed to me to open the
window.

“Matilda, bring me my bonnet.  I must go to those girls.  God pardon me,
if ever I have spoken contemptuously to the Captain!”

Miss Jenkyns arrayed herself to go out, telling Miss Matilda to give the
man a glass of wine.  While she was away, Miss Matty and I huddled over
the fire, talking in a low and awe-struck voice.  I know we cried quietly
all the time.

Miss Jenkyns came home in a silent mood, and we durst not ask her many
questions.  She told us that Miss Jessie had fainted, and that she and
Miss Pole had had some difficulty in bringing her round; but that, as
soon as she recovered, she begged one of them to go and sit with her
sister.

“Mr Hoggins says she cannot live many days, and she shall be spared this
shock,” said Miss Jessie, shivering with feelings to which she dared not
give way.

“But how can you manage, my dear?” asked Miss Jenkyns; “you cannot bear
up, she must see your tears.”

“God will help me—I will not give way—she was asleep when the news came;
she may be asleep yet.  She would be so utterly miserable, not merely at
my father’s death, but to think of what would become of me; she is so
good to me.”  She looked up earnestly in their faces with her soft true
eyes, and Miss Pole told Miss Jenkyns afterwards she could hardly bear
it, knowing, as she did, how Miss Brown treated her sister.

However, it was settled according to Miss Jessie’s wish.  Miss Brown was
to be told her father had been summoned to take a short journey on
railway business.  They had managed it in some way—Miss Jenkyns could not
exactly say how.  Miss Pole was to stop with Miss Jessie.  Mrs Jamieson
had sent to inquire.  And this was all we heard that night; and a
sorrowful night it was.  The next day a full account of the fatal
accident was in the county paper which Miss Jenkyns took in.  Her eyes
were very weak, she said, and she asked me to read it.  When I came to
the “gallant gentleman was deeply engaged in the perusal of a number of
‘Pickwick,’ which he had just received,” Miss Jenkyns shook her head long
and solemnly, and then sighed out, “Poor, dear, infatuated man!”

The corpse was to be taken from the station to the parish church, there
to be interred.  Miss Jessie had set her heart on following it to the
grave; and no dissuasives could alter her resolve.  Her restraint upon
herself made her almost obstinate; she resisted all Miss Pole’s
entreaties and Miss Jenkyns’ advice.  At last Miss Jenkyns gave up the
point; and after a silence, which I feared portended some deep
displeasure against Miss Jessie, Miss Jenkyns said she should accompany
the latter to the funeral.

“It is not fit for you to go alone.  It would be against both propriety
and humanity were I to allow it.”

Miss Jessie seemed as if she did not half like this arrangement; but her
obstinacy, if she had any, had been exhausted in her determination to go
to the interment.  She longed, poor thing, I have no doubt, to cry alone
over the grave of the dear father to whom she had been all in all, and to
give way, for one little half-hour, uninterrupted by sympathy and
unobserved by friendship.  But it was not to be.  That afternoon Miss
Jenkyns sent out for a yard of black crape, and employed herself busily
in trimming the little black silk bonnet I have spoken about.  When it
was finished she put it on, and looked at us for approbation—admiration
she despised.  I was full of sorrow, but, by one of those whimsical
thoughts which come unbidden into our heads, in times of deepest grief, I
no sooner saw the bonnet than I was reminded of a helmet; and in that
hybrid bonnet, half helmet, half jockey-cap, did Miss Jenkyns attend
Captain Brown’s funeral, and, I believe, supported Miss Jessie with a
tender, indulgent firmness which was invaluable, allowing her to weep her
passionate fill before they left.

Miss Pole, Miss Matty, and I, meanwhile attended to Miss Brown: and hard
work we found it to relieve her querulous and never-ending complaints.
But if we were so weary and dispirited, what must Miss Jessie have been!
Yet she came back almost calm as if she had gained a new strength.  She
put off her mourning dress, and came in, looking pale and gentle,
thanking us each with a soft long pressure of the hand.  She could even
smile—a faint, sweet, wintry smile—as if to reassure us of her power to
endure; but her look made our eyes fill suddenly with tears, more than if
she had cried outright.

It was settled that Miss Pole was to remain with her all the watching
livelong night; and that Miss Matty and I were to return in the morning
to relieve them, and give Miss Jessie the opportunity for a few hours of
sleep.  But when the morning came, Miss Jenkyns appeared at the
breakfast-table, equipped in her helmet-bonnet, and ordered Miss Matty to
stay at home, as she meant to go and help to nurse.  She was evidently in
a state of great friendly excitement, which she showed by eating her
breakfast standing, and scolding the household all round.

No nursing—no energetic strong-minded woman could help Miss Brown now.
There was that in the room as we entered which was stronger than us all,
and made us shrink into solemn awestruck helplessness.  Miss Brown was
dying.  We hardly knew her voice, it was so devoid of the complaining
tone we had always associated with it.  Miss Jessie told me afterwards
that it, and her face too, were just what they had been formerly, when
her mother’s death left her the young anxious head of the family, of whom
only Miss Jessie survived.

She was conscious of her sister’s presence, though not, I think, of ours.
We stood a little behind the curtain: Miss Jessie knelt with her face
near her sister’s, in order to catch the last soft awful whispers.

“Oh, Jessie!  Jessie!  How selfish I have been!  God forgive me for
letting you sacrifice yourself for me as you did!  I have so loved
you—and yet I have thought only of myself.  God forgive me!”

“Hush, love! hush!” said Miss Jessie, sobbing.

“And my father, my dear, dear father!  I will not complain now, if God
will give me strength to be patient.  But, oh, Jessie! tell my father how
I longed and yearned to see him at last, and to ask his forgiveness.  He
can never know now how I loved him—oh! if I might but tell him, before I
die!  What a life of sorrow his has been, and I have done so little to
cheer him!”

A light came into Miss Jessie’s face.  “Would it comfort you, dearest, to
think that he does know?—would it comfort you, love, to know that his
cares, his sorrows”—Her voice quivered, but she steadied it into
calmness—“Mary! he has gone before you to the place where the weary are
at rest.  He knows now how you loved him.”

A strange look, which was not distress, came over Miss Brown’s face.  She
did not speak for come time, but then we saw her lips form the words,
rather than heard the sound—“Father, mother, Harry, Archy;”—then, as if
it were a new idea throwing a filmy shadow over her darkened mind—“But
you will be alone, Jessie!”

Miss Jessie had been feeling this all during the silence, I think; for
the tears rolled down her cheeks like rain, at these words, and she could
not answer at first.  Then she put her hands together tight, and lifted
them up, and said—but not to us—“Though He slay me, yet will I trust in
Him.”

In a few moments more Miss Brown lay calm and still—never to sorrow or
murmur more.

After this second funeral, Miss Jenkyns insisted that Miss Jessie should
come to stay with her rather than go back to the desolate house, which,
in fact, we learned from Miss Jessie, must now be given up, as she had
not wherewithal to maintain it.  She had something above twenty pounds a
year, besides the interest of the money for which the furniture would
sell; but she could not live upon that: and so we talked over her
qualifications for earning money.

“I can sew neatly,” said she, “and I like nursing.  I think, too, I could
manage a house, if any one would try me as housekeeper; or I would go
into a shop as saleswoman, if they would have patience with me at first.”

Miss Jenkyns declared, in an angry voice, that she should do no such
thing; and talked to herself about “some people having no idea of their
rank as a captain’s daughter,” nearly an hour afterwards, when she
brought Miss Jessie up a basin of delicately-made arrowroot, and stood
over her like a dragoon until the last spoonful was finished: then she
disappeared.  Miss Jessie began to tell me some more of the plans which
had suggested themselves to her, and insensibly fell into talking of the
days that were past and gone, and interested me so much I neither knew
nor heeded how time passed.  We were both startled when Miss Jenkyns
reappeared, and caught us crying.  I was afraid lest she would be
displeased, as she often said that crying hindered digestion, and I knew
she wanted Miss Jessie to get strong; but, instead, she looked queer and
excited, and fidgeted round us without saying anything.  At last she
spoke.

“I have been so much startled—no, I’ve not been at all startled—don’t
mind me, my dear Miss Jessie—I’ve been very much surprised—in fact, I’ve
had a caller, whom you knew once, my dear Miss Jessie”—

Miss Jessie went very white, then flushed scarlet, and looked eagerly at
Miss Jenkyns.

“A gentleman, my dear, who wants to know if you would see him.”

“Is it?—it is not”—stammered out Miss Jessie—and got no farther.

“This is his card,” said Miss Jenkyns, giving it to Miss Jessie; and
while her head was bent over it, Miss Jenkyns went through a series of
winks and odd faces to me, and formed her lips into a long sentence, of
which, of course, I could not understand a word.

“May he come up?” asked Miss Jenkyns at last.

“Oh, yes! certainly!” said Miss Jessie, as much as to say, this is your
house, you may show any visitor where you like.  She took up some
knitting of Miss Matty’s and began to be very busy, though I could see
how she trembled all over.

Miss Jenkyns rang the bell, and told the servant who answered it to show
Major Gordon upstairs; and, presently, in walked a tall, fine,
frank-looking man of forty or upwards.  He shook hands with Miss Jessie;
but he could not see her eyes, she kept them so fixed on the ground.
Miss Jenkyns asked me if I would come and help her to tie up the
preserves in the store-room; and though Miss Jessie plucked at my gown,
and even looked up at me with begging eye, I durst not refuse to go where
Miss Jenkyns asked.  Instead of tying up preserves in the store-room,
however, we went to talk in the dining-room; and there Miss Jenkyns told
me what Major Gordon had told her; how he had served in the same regiment
with Captain Brown, and had become acquainted with Miss Jessie, then a
sweet-looking, blooming girl of eighteen; how the acquaintance had grown
into love on his part, though it had been some years before he had
spoken; how, on becoming possessed, through the will of an uncle, of a
good estate in Scotland, he had offered and been refused, though with so
much agitation and evident distress that he was sure she was not
indifferent to him; and how he had discovered that the obstacle was the
fell disease which was, even then, too surely threatening her sister.
She had mentioned that the surgeons foretold intense suffering; and there
was no one but herself to nurse her poor Mary, or cheer and comfort her
father during the time of illness.  They had had long discussions; and on
her refusal to pledge herself to him as his wife when all should be over,
he had grown angry, and broken off entirely, and gone abroad, believing
that she was a cold-hearted person whom he would do well to forget.  He
had been travelling in the East, and was on his return home when, at
Rome, he saw the account of Captain Brown’s death in _Galignani_.

Just then Miss Matty, who had been out all the morning, and had only
lately returned to the house, burst in with a face of dismay and outraged
propriety.

“Oh, goodness me!” she said.  “Deborah, there’s a gentleman sitting in
the drawing-room with his arm round Miss Jessie’s waist!”  Miss Matty’s
eyes looked large with terror.

          [Picture: “With his arm around Miss Jessie’s waist!”]

Miss Jenkyns snubbed her down in an instant.

“The most proper place in the world for his arm to be in.  Go away,
Matilda, and mind your own business.”  This from her sister, who had
hitherto been a model of feminine decorum, was a blow for poor Miss
Matty, and with a double shock she left the room.

The last time I ever saw poor Miss Jenkyns was many years after this.
Mrs Gordon had kept up a warm and affectionate intercourse with all at
Cranford.  Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, and Miss Pole had all been to visit
her, and returned with wonderful accounts of her house, her husband, her
dress, and her looks.  For, with happiness, something of her early bloom
returned; she had been a year or two younger than we had taken her for.
Her eyes were always lovely, and, as Mrs Gordon, her dimples were not out
of place.  At the time to which I have referred, when I last saw Miss
Jenkyns, that lady was old and feeble, and had lost something of her
strong mind.  Little Flora Gordon was staying with the Misses Jenkyns,
and when I came in she was reading aloud to Miss Jenkyns, who lay feeble
and changed on the sofa.  Flora put down the _Rambler_ when I came in.

“Ah!” said Miss Jenkyns, “you find me changed, my dear.  I can’t see as I
used to do.  If Flora were not here to read to me, I hardly know how I
should get through the day.  Did you ever read the _Rambler_?  It’s a
wonderful book—wonderful! and the most improving reading for Flora”
(which I daresay it would have been, if she could have read half the
words without spelling, and could have understood the meaning of a
third), “better than that strange old book, with the queer name, poor
Captain Brown was killed for reading—that book by Mr Boz, you know—‘Old
Poz’; when I was a girl—but that’s a long time ago—I acted Lucy in ‘Old
Poz.’”  She babbled on long enough for Flora to get a good long spell at
the “Christmas Carol,” which Miss Matty had left on the table.




CHAPTER III—A LOVE AFFAIR OF LONG AGO


I THOUGHT that probably my connection with Cranford would cease after
Miss Jenkyns’s death; at least, that it would have to be kept up by
correspondence, which bears much the same relation to personal
intercourse that the books of dried plants I sometimes see (“Hortus
Siccus,” I think they call the thing) do to the living and fresh flowers
in the lanes and meadows.  I was pleasantly surprised, therefore, by
receiving a letter from Miss Pole (who had always come in for a
supplementary week after my annual visit to Miss Jenkyns) proposing that
I should go and stay with her; and then, in a couple of days after my
acceptance, came a note from Miss Matty, in which, in a rather circuitous
and very humble manner, she told me how much pleasure I should confer if
I could spend a week or two with her, either before or after I had been
at Miss Pole’s; “for,” she said, “since my dear sister’s death I am well
aware I have no attractions to offer; it is only to the kindness of my
friends that I can owe their company.”

Of course I promised to come to dear Miss Matty as soon as I had ended my
visit to Miss Pole; and the day after my arrival at Cranford I went to
see her, much wondering what the house would be like without Miss
Jenkyns, and rather dreading the changed aspect of things.  Miss Matty
began to cry as soon as she saw me.  She was evidently nervous from
having anticipated my call.  I comforted her as well as I could; and I
found the best consolation I could give was the honest praise that came
from my heart as I spoke of the deceased.  Miss Matty slowly shook her
head over each virtue as it was named and attributed to her sister; and
at last she could not restrain the tears which had long been silently
flowing, but hid her face behind her handkerchief and sobbed aloud.

“Dear Miss Matty,” said I, taking her hand—for indeed I did not know in
what way to tell her how sorry I was for her, left deserted in the world.
She put down her handkerchief and said—

“My dear, I’d rather you did not call me Matty.  She did not like it; but
I did many a thing she did not like, I’m afraid—and now she’s gone!  If
you please, my love, will you call me Matilda?”

I promised faithfully, and began to practise the new name with Miss Pole
that very day; and, by degrees, Miss Matilda’s feeling on the subject was
known through Cranford, and we all tried to drop the more familiar name,
but with so little success that by-and-by we gave up the attempt.

My visit to Miss Pole was very quiet.  Miss Jenkyns had so long taken the
lead in Cranford that now she was gone, they hardly knew how to give a
party.  The Honourable Mrs Jamieson, to whom Miss Jenkyns herself had
always yielded the post of honour, was fat and inert, and very much at
the mercy of her old servants.  If they chose that she should give a
party, they reminded her of the necessity for so doing: if not, she let
it alone.  There was all the more time for me to hear old-world stories
from Miss Pole, while she sat knitting, and I making my father’s shirts.
I always took a quantity of plain sewing to Cranford; for, as we did not
read much, or walk much, I found it a capital time to get through my
work.  One of Miss Pole’s stories related to a shadow of a love affair
that was dimly perceived or suspected long years before.

Presently, the time arrived when I was to remove to Miss Matilda’s house.
I found her timid and anxious about the arrangements for my comfort.
Many a time, while I was unpacking, did she come backwards and forwards
to stir the fire which burned all the worse for being so frequently
poked.

“Have you drawers enough, dear?” asked she.  “I don’t know exactly how my
sister used to arrange them.  She had capital methods.  I am sure she
would have trained a servant in a week to make a better fire than this,
and Fanny has been with me four months.”

This subject of servants was a standing grievance, and I could not wonder
much at it; for if gentlemen were scarce, and almost unheard of in the
“genteel society” of Cranford, they or their counterparts—handsome young
men—abounded in the lower classes.  The pretty neat servant-maids had
their choice of desirable “followers”; and their mistresses, without
having the sort of mysterious dread of men and matrimony that Miss
Matilda had, might well feel a little anxious lest the heads of their
comely maids should be turned by the joiner, or the butcher, or the
gardener, who were obliged, by their callings, to come to the house, and
who, as ill-luck would have it, were generally handsome and unmarried.
Fanny’s lovers, if she had any—and Miss Matilda suspected her of so many
flirtations that, if she had not been very pretty, I should have doubted
her having one—were a constant anxiety to her mistress.  She was
forbidden, by the articles of her engagement, to have “followers”; and
though she had answered, innocently enough, doubling up the hem of her
apron as she spoke, “Please, ma’am, I never had more than one at a time,”
Miss Matty prohibited that one.  But a vision of a man seemed to haunt
the kitchen.  Fanny assured me that it was all fancy, or else I should
have said myself that I had seen a man’s coat-tails whisk into the
scullery once, when I went on an errand into the store-room at night; and
another evening, when, our watches having stopped, I went to look at the
clock, there was a very odd appearance, singularly like a young man
squeezed up between the clock and the back of the open kitchen-door: and
I thought Fanny snatched up the candle very hastily, so as to throw the
shadow on the clock face, while she very positively told me the time
half-an-hour too early, as we found out afterwards by the church clock.
But I did not add to Miss Matty’s anxieties by naming my suspicions,
especially as Fanny said to me, the next day, that it was such a queer
kitchen for having odd shadows about it, she really was almost afraid to
stay; “for you know, miss,” she added, “I don’t see a creature from six
o’clock tea, till Missus rings the bell for prayers at ten.”

However, it so fell out that Fanny had to leave and Miss Matilda begged
me to stay and “settle her” with the new maid; to which I consented,
after I had heard from my father that he did not want me at home.  The
new servant was a rough, honest-looking, country girl, who had only lived
in a farm place before; but I liked her looks when she came to be hired;
and I promised Miss Matilda to put her in the ways of the house.  The
said ways were religiously such as Miss Matilda thought her sister would
approve.  Many a domestic rule and regulation had been a subject of
plaintive whispered murmur to me during Miss Jenkyns’s life; but now that
she was gone, I do not think that even I, who was a favourite, durst have
suggested an alteration.  To give an instance: we constantly adhered to
the forms which were observed, at meal-times, in “my father, the rector’s
house.”  Accordingly, we had always wine and dessert; but the decanters
were only filled when there was a party, and what remained was seldom
touched, though we had two wine-glasses apiece every day after dinner,
until the next festive occasion arrived, when the state of the remainder
wine was examined into in a family council.  The dregs were often given
to the poor: but occasionally, when a good deal had been left at the last
party (five months ago, it might be), it was added to some of a fresh
bottle, brought up from the cellar.  I fancy poor Captain Brown did not
much like wine, for I noticed he never finished his first glass, and most
military men take several.  Then, as to our dessert, Miss Jenkyns used to
gather currants and gooseberries for it herself, which I sometimes
thought would have tasted better fresh from the trees; but then, as Miss
Jenkyns observed, there would have been nothing for dessert in
summer-time.  As it was, we felt very genteel with our two glasses
apiece, and a dish of gooseberries at the top, of currants and biscuits
at the sides, and two decanters at the bottom.  When oranges came in, a
curious proceeding was gone through.  Miss Jenkyns did not like to cut
the fruit; for, as she observed, the juice all ran out nobody knew where;
sucking (only I think she used some more recondite word) was in fact the
only way of enjoying oranges; but then there was the unpleasant
association with a ceremony frequently gone through by little babies; and
so, after dessert, in orange season, Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matty used to
rise up, possess themselves each of an orange in silence, and withdraw to
the privacy of their own rooms to indulge in sucking oranges.

I had once or twice tried, on such occasions, to prevail on Miss Matty to
stay, and had succeeded in her sister’s lifetime.  I held up a screen,
and did not look, and, as she said, she tried not to make the noise very
offensive; but now that she was left alone, she seemed quite horrified
when I begged her to remain with me in the warm dining-parlour, and enjoy
her orange as she liked best.  And so it was in everything.  Miss
Jenkyns’s rules were made more stringent than ever, because the framer of
them was gone where there could be no appeal.  In all things else Miss
Matilda was meek and undecided to a fault.  I have heard Fanny turn her
round twenty times in a morning about dinner, just as the little hussy
chose; and I sometimes fancied she worked on Miss Matilda’s weakness in
order to bewilder her, and to make her feel more in the power of her
clever servant.  I determined that I would not leave her till I had seen
what sort of a person Martha was; and, if I found her trustworthy, I
would tell her not to trouble her mistress with every little decision.

Martha was blunt and plain-spoken to a fault; otherwise she was a brisk,
well-meaning, but very ignorant girl.  She had not been with us a week
before Miss Matilda and I were astounded one morning by the receipt of a
letter from a cousin of hers, who had been twenty or thirty years in
India, and who had lately, as we had seen by the “Army List,” returned to
England, bringing with him an invalid wife who had never been introduced
to her English relations.  Major Jenkyns wrote to propose that he and his
wife should spend a night at Cranford, on his way to Scotland—at the inn,
if it did not suit Miss Matilda to receive them into her house; in which
case they should hope to be with her as much as possible during the day.
Of course it _must_ suit her, as she said; for all Cranford knew that she
had her sister’s bedroom at liberty; but I am sure she wished the Major
had stopped in India and forgotten his cousins out and out.

“Oh! how must I manage?” asked she helplessly.  “If Deborah had been
alive she would have known what to do with a gentleman-visitor.  Must I
put razors in his dressing-room?  Dear! dear! and I’ve got none.  Deborah
would have had them.  And slippers, and coat-brushes?”  I suggested that
probably he would bring all these things with him.  “And after dinner,
how am I to know when to get up and leave him to his wine?  Deborah would
have done it so well; she would have been quite in her element.  Will he
want coffee, do you think?”  I undertook the management of the coffee,
and told her I would instruct Martha in the art of waiting—in which it
must be owned she was terribly deficient—and that I had no doubt Major
and Mrs Jenkyns would understand the quiet mode in which a lady lived by
herself in a country town.  But she was sadly fluttered.  I made her
empty her decanters and bring up two fresh bottles of wine.  I wished I
could have prevented her from being present at my instructions to Martha,
for she frequently cut in with some fresh direction, muddling the poor
girl’s mind as she stood open-mouthed, listening to us both.

“Hand the vegetables round,” said I (foolishly, I see now—for it was
aiming at more than we could accomplish with quietness and simplicity);
and then, seeing her look bewildered, I added, “take the vegetables round
to people, and let them help themselves.”

“And mind you go first to the ladies,” put in Miss Matilda.  “Always go
to the ladies before gentlemen when you are waiting.”

“I’ll do it as you tell me, ma’am,” said Martha; “but I like lads best.”

We felt very uncomfortable and shocked at this speech of Martha’s, yet I
don’t think she meant any harm; and, on the whole, she attended very well
to our directions, except that she “nudged” the Major when he did not
help himself as soon as she expected to the potatoes, while she was
handing them round.

The major and his wife were quiet unpretending people enough when they
did come; languid, as all East Indians are, I suppose.  We were rather
dismayed at their bringing two servants with them, a Hindoo body-servant
for the Major, and a steady elderly maid for his wife; but they slept at
the inn, and took off a good deal of the responsibility by attending
carefully to their master’s and mistress’s comfort.  Martha, to be sure,
had never ended her staring at the East Indian’s white turban and brown
complexion, and I saw that Miss Matilda shrunk away from him a little as
he waited at dinner.  Indeed, she asked me, when they were gone, if he
did not remind me of Blue Beard?  On the whole, the visit was most
satisfactory, and is a subject of conversation even now with Miss
Matilda; at the time it greatly excited Cranford, and even stirred up the
apathetic and Honourable Mrs Jamieson to some expression of interest,
when I went to call and thank her for the kind answers she had vouchsafed
to Miss Matilda’s inquiries as to the arrangement of a gentleman’s
dressing-room—answers which I must confess she had given in the wearied
manner of the Scandinavian prophetess—

                       “Leave me, leave me to repose.”

And _now_ I come to the love affair.

It seems that Miss Pole had a cousin, once or twice removed, who had
offered to Miss Matty long ago.  Now this cousin lived four or five miles
from Cranford on his own estate; but his property was not large enough to
entitle him to rank higher than a yeoman; or rather, with something of
the “pride which apes humility,” he had refused to push himself on, as so
many of his class had done, into the ranks of the squires.  He would not
allow himself to be called Thomas Holbrook, _Esq._; he even sent back
letters with this address, telling the post-mistress at Cranford that his
name was _Mr_ Thomas Holbrook, yeoman.  He rejected all domestic
innovations; he would have the house door stand open in summer and shut
in winter, without knocker or bell to summon a servant.  The closed fist
or the knob of a stick did this office for him if he found the door
locked.  He despised every refinement which had not its root deep down in
humanity.  If people were not ill, he saw no necessity for moderating his
voice.  He spoke the dialect of the country in perfection, and constantly
used it in conversation; although Miss Pole (who gave me these
particulars) added, that he read aloud more beautifully and with more
feeling than any one she had ever heard, except the late rector.

“And how came Miss Matilda not to marry him?” asked I.

“Oh, I don’t know.  She was willing enough, I think; but you know Cousin
Thomas would not have been enough of a gentleman for the rector and Miss
Jenkyns.”

“Well! but they were not to marry him,” said I, impatiently.

“No; but they did not like Miss Matty to marry below her rank.  You know
she was the rector’s daughter, and somehow they are related to Sir Peter
Arley: Miss Jenkyns thought a deal of that.”

“Poor Miss Matty!” said I.

“Nay, now, I don’t know anything more than that he offered and was
refused.  Miss Matty might not like him—and Miss Jenkyns might never have
said a word—it is only a guess of mine.”

“Has she never seen him since?” I inquired.

“No, I think not.  You see Woodley, Cousin Thomas’s house, lies half-way
between Cranford and Misselton; and I know he made Misselton his
market-town very soon after he had offered to Miss Matty; and I don’t
think he has been into Cranford above once or twice since—once, when I
was walking with Miss Matty, in High Street, and suddenly she darted from
me, and went up Shire Lane.  A few minutes after I was startled by
meeting Cousin Thomas.”

“How old is he?” I asked, after a pause of castle-building.

“He must be about seventy, I think, my dear,” said Miss Pole, blowing up
my castle, as if by gun-powder, into small fragments.

Very soon after—at least during my long visit to Miss Matilda—I had the
opportunity of seeing Mr Holbrook; seeing, too, his first encounter with
his former love, after thirty or forty years’ separation.  I was helping
to decide whether any of the new assortment of coloured silks which they
had just received at the shop would do to match a grey and black
mousseline-delaine that wanted a new breadth, when a tall, thin, Don
Quixote-looking old man came into the shop for some woollen gloves.  I
had never seen the person (who was rather striking) before, and I watched
him rather attentively while Miss Matty listened to the shopman.  The
stranger wore a blue coat with brass buttons, drab breeches, and gaiters,
and drummed with his fingers on the counter until he was attended to.
When he answered the shop-boy’s question, “What can I have the pleasure
of showing you to-day, sir?” I saw Miss Matilda start, and then suddenly
sit down; and instantly I guessed who it was.  She had made some inquiry
which had to be carried round to the other shopman.

“Miss Jenkyns wants the black sarsenet two-and-twopence the yard”; and Mr
Holbrook had caught the name, and was across the shop in two strides.

“Matty—Miss Matilda—Miss Jenkyns!  God bless my soul!  I should not have
known you.  How are you? how are you?”  He kept shaking her hand in a way
which proved the warmth of his friendship; but he repeated so often, as
if to himself, “I should not have known you!” that any sentimental
romance which I might be inclined to build was quite done away with by
his manner.

However, he kept talking to us all the time we were in the shop; and then
waving the shopman with the unpurchased gloves on one side, with “Another
time, sir! another time!” he walked home with us.  I am happy to say my
client, Miss Matilda, also left the shop in an equally bewildered state,
not having purchased either green or red silk.  Mr Holbrook was evidently
full with honest loud-spoken joy at meeting his old love again; he
touched on the changes that had taken place; he even spoke of Miss
Jenkyns as “Your poor sister!  Well, well! we have all our faults”; and
bade us good-bye with many a hope that he should soon see Miss Matty
again.  She went straight to her room, and never came back till our early
tea-time, when I thought she looked as if she had been crying.

              [Picture: Mr Holbrook . . . bade us good-bye]




CHAPTER IV—A VISIT TO AN OLD BACHELOR


A FEW days after, a note came from Mr Holbrook, asking us—impartially
asking both of us—in a formal, old-fashioned style, to spend a day at his
house—a long June day—for it was June now.  He named that he had also
invited his cousin, Miss Pole; so that we might join in a fly, which
could be put up at his house.

I expected Miss Matty to jump at this invitation; but, no!  Miss Pole and
I had the greatest difficulty in persuading her to go.  She thought it
was improper; and was even half annoyed when we utterly ignored the idea
of any impropriety in her going with two other ladies to see her old
lover.  Then came a more serious difficulty.  She did not think Deborah
would have liked her to go.  This took us half a day’s good hard talking
to get over; but, at the first sentence of relenting, I seized the
opportunity, and wrote and despatched an acceptance in her name—fixing
day and hour, that all might be decided and done with.

The next morning she asked me if I would go down to the shop with her;
and there, after much hesitation, we chose out three caps to be sent home
and tried on, that the most becoming might be selected to take with us on
Thursday.

She was in a state of silent agitation all the way to Woodley.  She had
evidently never been there before; and, although she little dreamt I knew
anything of her early story, I could perceive she was in a tremor at the
thought of seeing the place which might have been her home, and round
which it is probable that many of her innocent girlish imaginations had
clustered.  It was a long drive there, through paved jolting lanes.  Miss
Matilda sat bolt upright, and looked wistfully out of the windows as we
drew near the end of our journey.  The aspect of the country was quiet
and pastoral.  Woodley stood among fields; and there was an old-fashioned
garden where roses and currant-bushes touched each other, and where the
feathery asparagus formed a pretty background to the pinks and
gilly-flowers; there was no drive up to the door.  We got out at a little
gate, and walked up a straight box-edged path.

“My cousin might make a drive, I think,” said Miss Pole, who was afraid
of ear-ache, and had only her cap on.

“I think it is very pretty,” said Miss Matty, with a soft plaintiveness
in her voice, and almost in a whisper, for just then Mr Holbrook appeared
at the door, rubbing his hands in very effervescence of hospitality.  He
looked more like my idea of Don Quixote than ever, and yet the likeness
was only external.  His respectable housekeeper stood modestly at the
door to bid us welcome; and, while she led the elder ladies upstairs to a
bedroom, I begged to look about the garden.  My request evidently pleased
the old gentleman, who took me all round the place and showed me his
six-and-twenty cows, named after the different letters of the alphabet.
As we went along, he surprised me occasionally by repeating apt and
beautiful quotations from the poets, ranging easily from Shakespeare and
George Herbert to those of our own day.  He did this as naturally as if
he were thinking aloud, and their true and beautiful words were the best
expression he could find for what he was thinking or feeling.  To be sure
he called Byron “my Lord Byrron,” and pronounced the name of Goethe
strictly in accordance with the English sound of the letters—“As Goethe
says, ‘Ye ever-verdant palaces,’” &c.  Altogether, I never met with a
man, before or since, who had spent so long a life in a secluded and not
impressive country, with ever-increasing delight in the daily and yearly
change of season and beauty.

When he and I went in, we found that dinner was nearly ready in the
kitchen—for so I suppose the room ought to be called, as there were oak
dressers and cupboards all round, all over by the side of the fireplace,
and only a small Turkey carpet in the middle of the flag-floor.  The room
might have been easily made into a handsome dark oak dining-parlour by
removing the oven and a few other appurtenances of a kitchen, which were
evidently never used, the real cooking-place being at some distance.  The
room in which we were expected to sit was a stiffly-furnished, ugly
apartment; but that in which we did sit was what Mr Holbrook called the
counting-house, where he paid his labourers their weekly wages at a great
desk near the door.  The rest of the pretty sitting-room—looking into the
orchard, and all covered over with dancing tree-shadows—was filled with
books.  They lay on the ground, they covered the walls, they strewed the
table.  He was evidently half ashamed and half proud of his extravagance
in this respect.  They were of all kinds—poetry and wild weird tales
prevailing.  He evidently chose his books in accordance with his own
tastes, not because such and such were classical or established
favourites.

“Ah!” he said, “we farmers ought not to have much time for reading; yet
somehow one can’t help it.”

“What a pretty room!” said Miss Matty, _sotto voce_.

“What a pleasant place!” said I, aloud, almost simultaneously.

“Nay! if you like it,” replied he; “but can you sit on these great, black
leather, three-cornered chairs?  I like it better than the best parlour;
but I thought ladies would take that for the smarter place.”

It was the smarter place, but, like most smart things, not at all pretty,
or pleasant, or home-like; so, while we were at dinner, the servant-girl
dusted and scrubbed the counting-house chairs, and we sat there all the
rest of the day.

We had pudding before meat; and I thought Mr Holbrook was going to make
some apology for his old-fashioned ways, for he began—

“I don’t know whether you like newfangled ways.”

“Oh, not at all!” said Miss Matty.

“No more do I,” said he.  “My house-keeper _will_ have these in her new
fashion; or else I tell her that, when I was a young man, we used to keep
strictly to my father’s rule, ‘No broth, no ball; no ball, no beef’; and
always began dinner with broth.  Then we had suet puddings, boiled in the
broth with the beef: and then the meat itself.  If we did not sup our
broth, we had no ball, which we liked a deal better; and the beef came
last of all, and only those had it who had done justice to the broth and
the ball.  Now folks begin with sweet things, and turn their dinners
topsy-turvy.”

When the ducks and green peas came, we looked at each other in dismay; we
had only two-pronged, black-handled forks.  It is true the steel was as
bright as silver; but what were we to do?  Miss Matty picked up her peas,
one by one, on the point of the prongs, much as Aminé ate her grains of
rice after her previous feast with the Ghoul.  Miss Pole sighed over her
delicate young peas as she left them on one side of her plate untasted,
for they _would_ drop between the prongs.  I looked at my host: the peas
were going wholesale into his capacious mouth, shovelled up by his large
round-ended knife.  I saw, I imitated, I survived!  My friends, in spite
of my precedent, could not muster up courage enough to do an ungenteel
thing; and, if Mr Holbrook had not been so heartily hungry, he would
probably have seen that the good peas went away almost untouched.

After dinner, a clay pipe was brought in, and a spittoon; and, asking us
to retire to another room, where he would soon join us, if we disliked
tobacco-smoke, he presented his pipe to Miss Matty, and requested her to
fill the bowl.  This was a compliment to a lady in his youth; but it was
rather inappropriate to propose it as an honour to Miss Matty, who had
been trained by her sister to hold smoking of every kind in utter
abhorrence.  But if it was a shock to her refinement, it was also a
gratification to her feelings to be thus selected; so she daintily
stuffed the strong tobacco into the pipe, and then we withdrew.

“It is very pleasant dining with a bachelor,” said Miss Matty softly, as
we settled ourselves in the counting-house.  “I only hope it is not
improper; so many pleasant things are!”

“What a number of books he has!” said Miss Pole, looking round the room.
“And how dusty they are!”

“I think it must be like one of the great Dr Johnson’s rooms,” said Miss
Matty.  “What a superior man your cousin must be!”

“Yes!” said Miss Pole, “he’s a great reader; but I am afraid he has got
into very uncouth habits with living alone.”

“Oh! uncouth is too hard a word.  I should call him eccentric; very
clever people always are!” replied Miss Matty.

            [Picture: Now, what colour are ash-buds in March]

When Mr Holbrook returned, he proposed a walk in the fields; but the two
elder ladies were afraid of damp, and dirt, and had only very unbecoming
calashes to put on over their caps; so they declined, and I was again his
companion in a turn which he said he was obliged to take to see after his
men.  He strode along, either wholly forgetting my existence, or soothed
into silence by his pipe—and yet it was not silence exactly.  He walked
before me with a stooping gait, his hands clasped behind him; and, as
some tree or cloud, or glimpse of distant upland pastures, struck him, he
quoted poetry to himself, saying it out loud in a grand sonorous voice,
with just the emphasis that true feeling and appreciation give.  We came
upon an old cedar tree, which stood at one end of the house—

    “The cedar spreads his dark-green layers of shade.”

“Capital term—‘layers!’  Wonderful man!”  I did not know whether he was
speaking to me or not; but I put in an assenting “wonderful,” although I
knew nothing about it, just because I was tired of being forgotten, and
of being consequently silent.

He turned sharp round.  “Ay! you may say ‘wonderful.’  Why, when I saw
the review of his poems in _Blackwood_, I set off within an hour, and
walked seven miles to Misselton (for the horses were not in the way) and
ordered them.  Now, what colour are ash-buds in March?”

Is the man going mad? thought I.  He is very like Don Quixote.

“What colour are they, I say?” repeated he vehemently.

“I am sure I don’t know, sir,” said I, with the meekness of ignorance.

“I knew you didn’t.  No more did I—an old fool that I am!—till this young
man comes and tells me.  Black as ash-buds in March.  And I’ve lived all
my life in the country; more shame for me not to know.  Black: they are
jet-black, madam.”  And he went off again, swinging along to the music of
some rhyme he had got hold of.

When we came back, nothing would serve him but he must read us the poems
he had been speaking of; and Miss Pole encouraged him in his proposal, I
thought, because she wished me to hear his beautiful reading, of which
she had boasted; but she afterwards said it was because she had got to a
difficult part of her crochet, and wanted to count her stitches without
having to talk.  Whatever he had proposed would have been right to Miss
Matty; although she did fall sound asleep within five minutes after he
had begun a long poem, called “Locksley Hall,” and had a comfortable nap,
unobserved, till he ended; when the cessation of his voice wakened her
up, and she said, feeling that something was expected, and that Miss Pole
was counting—

“What a pretty book!”

“Pretty, madam! it’s beautiful!  Pretty, indeed!”

“Oh yes!  I meant beautiful!” said she, fluttered at his disapproval of
her word.  “It is so like that beautiful poem of Dr Johnson’s my sister
used to read—I forget the name of it; what was it, my dear?” turning to
me.

“Which do you mean, ma’am?  What was it about?”

“I don’t remember what it was about, and I’ve quite forgotten what the
name of it was; but it was written by Dr Johnson, and was very beautiful,
and very like what Mr Holbrook has just been reading.”

“I don’t remember it,” said he reflectively.  “But I don’t know Dr
Johnson’s poems well.  I must read them.”

As we were getting into the fly to return, I heard Mr Holbrook say he
should call on the ladies soon, and inquire how they got home; and this
evidently pleased and fluttered Miss Matty at the time he said it; but
after we had lost sight of the old house among the trees her sentiments
towards the master of it were gradually absorbed into a distressing
wonder as to whether Martha had broken her word, and seized on the
opportunity of her mistress’s absence to have a “follower.”  Martha
looked good, and steady, and composed enough, as she came to help us out;
she was always careful of Miss Matty, and to-night she made use of this
unlucky speech—

“Eh! dear ma’am, to think of your going out in an evening in such a thin
shawl!  It’s no better than muslin.  At your age, ma’am, you should be
careful.”

“My age!” said Miss Matty, almost speaking crossly, for her, for she was
usually gentle—“My age!  Why, how old do you think I am, that you talk
about my age?”

“Well, ma’am, I should say you were not far short of sixty: but folks’
looks is often against them—and I’m sure I meant no harm.”

“Martha, I’m not yet fifty-two!” said Miss Matty, with grave emphasis;
for probably the remembrance of her youth had come very vividly before
her this day, and she was annoyed at finding that golden time so far away
in the past.

But she never spoke of any former and more intimate acquaintance with Mr
Holbrook.  She had probably met with so little sympathy in her early
love, that she had shut it up close in her heart; and it was only by a
sort of watching, which I could hardly avoid since Miss Pole’s
confidence, that I saw how faithful her poor heart had been in its sorrow
and its silence.

She gave me some good reason for wearing her best cap every day, and sat
near the window, in spite of her rheumatism, in order to see, without
being seen, down into the street.

He came.  He put his open palms upon his knees, which were far apart, as
he sat with his head bent down, whistling, after we had replied to his
inquiries about our safe return.  Suddenly he jumped up—

“Well, madam! have you any commands for Paris?  I am going there in a
week or two.”

“To Paris!” we both exclaimed.

“Yes, madam!  I’ve never been there, and always had a wish to go; and I
think if I don’t go soon, I mayn’t go at all; so as soon as the hay is
got in I shall go, before harvest time.”

We were so much astonished that we had no commissions.

Just as he was going out of the room, he turned back, with his favourite
exclamation—

“God bless my soul, madam! but I nearly forgot half my errand.  Here are
the poems for you you admired so much the other evening at my house.”  He
tugged away at a parcel in his coat-pocket.  “Good-bye, miss,” said he;
“good-bye, Matty! take care of yourself.”  And he was gone.  But he had
given her a book, and he had called her Matty, just as he used to do
thirty years to.

“I wish he would not go to Paris,” said Miss Matilda anxiously.  “I don’t
believe frogs will agree with him; he used to have to be very careful
what he ate, which was curious in so strong-looking a young man.”

Soon after this I took my leave, giving many an injunction to Martha to
look after her mistress, and to let me know if she thought that Miss
Matilda was not so well; in which case I would volunteer a visit to my
old friend, without noticing Martha’s intelligence to her.

Accordingly I received a line or two from Martha every now and then; and,
about November I had a note to say her mistress was “very low and sadly
off her food”; and the account made me so uneasy that, although Martha
did not decidedly summon me, I packed up my things and went.

I received a warm welcome, in spite of the little flurry produced by my
impromptu visit, for I had only been able to give a day’s notice.  Miss
Matilda looked miserably ill; and I prepared to comfort and cosset her.

I went down to have a private talk with Martha.

“How long has your mistress been so poorly?” I asked, as I stood by the
kitchen fire.

“Well!  I think it’s better than a fortnight; it is, I know; it was one
Tuesday, after Miss Pole had been, that she went into this moping way.  I
thought she was tired, and it would go off with a night’s rest; but no!
she has gone on and on ever since, till I thought it my duty to write to
you, ma’am.”

“You did quite right, Martha.  It is a comfort to think she has so
faithful a servant about her.  And I hope you find your place
comfortable?”

“Well, ma’am, missus is very kind, and there’s plenty to eat and drink,
and no more work but what I can do easily—but—” Martha hesitated.

“But what, Martha?”

“Why, it seems so hard of missus not to let me have any followers;
there’s such lots of young fellows in the town; and many a one has as
much as offered to keep company with me; and I may never be in such a
likely place again, and it’s like wasting an opportunity.  Many a girl as
I know would have ’em unbeknownst to missus; but I’ve given my word, and
I’ll stick to it; or else this is just the house for missus never to be
the wiser if they did come: and it’s such a capable kitchen—there’s such
dark corners in it—I’d be bound to hide any one.  I counted up last
Sunday night—for I’ll not deny I was crying because I had to shut the
door in Jem Hearn’s face, and he’s a steady young man, fit for any girl;
only I had given missus my word.”  Martha was all but crying again; and I
had little comfort to give her, for I knew, from old experience, of the
horror with which both the Miss Jenkynses looked upon “followers”; and in
Miss Matty’s present nervous state this dread was not likely to be
lessened.

I went to see Miss Pole the next day, and took her completely by
surprise, for she had not been to see Miss Matilda for two days.

“And now I must go back with you, my dear, for I promised to let her know
how Thomas Holbrook went on; and, I’m sorry to say, his housekeeper has
sent me word to-day that he hasn’t long to live.  Poor Thomas! that
journey to Paris was quite too much for him.  His housekeeper says he has
hardly ever been round his fields since, but just sits with his hands on
his knees in the counting-house, not reading or anything, but only saying
what a wonderful city Paris was!  Paris has much to answer for if it’s
killed my cousin Thomas, for a better man never lived.”

“Does Miss Matilda know of his illness?” asked I—a new light as to the
cause of her indisposition dawning upon me.

“Dear! to be sure, yes!  Has not she told you?  I let her know a
fortnight ago, or more, when first I heard of it.  How odd she shouldn’t
have told you!”

Not at all, I thought; but I did not say anything.  I felt almost guilty
of having spied too curiously into that tender heart, and I was not going
to speak of its secrets—hidden, Miss Matty believed, from all the world.
I ushered Miss Pole into Miss Matilda’s little drawing-room, and then
left them alone.  But I was not surprised when Martha came to my bedroom
door, to ask me to go down to dinner alone, for that missus had one of
her bad headaches.  She came into the drawing-room at tea-time, but it
was evidently an effort to her; and, as if to make up for some
reproachful feeling against her late sister, Miss Jenkyns, which had been
troubling her all the afternoon, and for which she now felt penitent, she
kept telling me how good and how clever Deborah was in her youth; how she
used to settle what gowns they were to wear at all the parties (faint,
ghostly ideas of grim parties, far away in the distance, when Miss Matty
and Miss Pole were young!); and how Deborah and her mother had started
the benefit society for the poor, and taught girls cooking and plain
sewing; and how Deborah had once danced with a lord; and how she used to
visit at Sir Peter Arley’s, and tried to remodel the quiet rectory
establishment on the plans of Arley Hall, where they kept thirty
servants; and how she had nursed Miss Matty through a long, long illness,
of which I had never heard before, but which I now dated in my own mind
as following the dismissal of the suit of Mr Holbrook.  So we talked
softly and quietly of old times through the long November evening.

The next day Miss Pole brought us word that Mr Holbrook was dead.  Miss
Matty heard the news in silence; in fact, from the account of the
previous day, it was only what we had to expect.  Miss Pole kept calling
upon us for some expression of regret, by asking if it was not sad that
he was gone, and saying—

“To think of that pleasant day last June, when he seemed so well!  And he
might have lived this dozen years if he had not gone to that wicked
Paris, where they are always having revolutions.”

She paused for some demonstration on our part.  I saw Miss Matty could
not speak, she was trembling so nervously; so I said what I really felt;
and after a call of some duration—all the time of which I have no doubt
Miss Pole thought Miss Matty received the news very calmly—our visitor
took her leave.

Miss Matty made a strong effort to conceal her feelings—a concealment she
practised even with me, for she has never alluded to Mr Holbrook again,
although the book he gave her lies with her Bible on the little table by
her bedside.  She did not think I heard her when she asked the little
milliner of Cranford to make her caps something like the Honourable Mrs
Jamieson’s, or that I noticed the reply—

“But she wears widows’ caps, ma’am?”

“Oh!  I only meant something in that style; not widows’, of course, but
rather like Mrs Jamieson’s.”

This effort at concealment was the beginning of the tremulous motion of
head and hands which I have seen ever since in Miss Matty.

The evening of the day on which we heard of Mr Holbrook’s death, Miss
Matilda was very silent and thoughtful; after prayers she called Martha
back and then she stood uncertain what to say.

“Martha!” she said, at last, “you are young”—and then she made so long a
pause that Martha, to remind her of her half-finished sentence, dropped a
curtsey, and said—

“Yes, please, ma’am; two-and-twenty last third of October, please,
ma’am.”

“And, perhaps, Martha, you may some time meet with a young man you like,
and who likes you.  I did say you were not to have followers; but if you
meet with such a young man, and tell me, and I find he is respectable, I
have no objection to his coming to see you once a week.  God forbid!”
said she in a low voice, “that I should grieve any young hearts.”  She
spoke as if she were providing for some distant contingency, and was
rather startled when Martha made her ready eager answer—

“Please, ma’am, there’s Jem Hearn, and he’s a joiner making
three-and-sixpence a-day, and six foot one in his stocking-feet, please,
ma’am; and if you’ll ask about him to-morrow morning, every one will give
him a character for steadiness; and he’ll be glad enough to come
to-morrow night, I’ll be bound.”

Though Miss Matty was startled, she submitted to Fate and Love.




CHAPTER V—OLD LETTERS


I HAVE often noticed that almost every one has his own individual small
economies—careful habits of saving fractions of pennies in some one
peculiar direction—any disturbance of which annoys him more than spending
shillings or pounds on some real extravagance.  An old gentleman of my
acquaintance, who took the intelligence of the failure of a Joint-Stock
Bank, in which some of his money was invested, with stoical mildness,
worried his family all through a long summer’s day because one of them
had torn (instead of cutting) out the written leaves of his now useless
bank-book; of course, the corresponding pages at the other end came out
as well, and this little unnecessary waste of paper (his private economy)
chafed him more than all the loss of his money.  Envelopes fretted his
soul terribly when they first came in; the only way in which he could
reconcile himself to such waste of his cherished article was by patiently
turning inside out all that were sent to him, and so making them serve
again.  Even now, though tamed by age, I see him casting wistful glances
at his daughters when they send a whole inside of a half-sheet of note
paper, with the three lines of acceptance to an invitation, written on
only one of the sides.  I am not above owning that I have this human
weakness myself.  String is my foible.  My pockets get full of little
hanks of it, picked up and twisted together, ready for uses that never
come.  I am seriously annoyed if any one cuts the string of a parcel
instead of patiently and faithfully undoing it fold by fold.  How people
can bring themselves to use india-rubber rings, which are a sort of
deification of string, as lightly as they do, I cannot imagine.  To me an
india-rubber ring is a precious treasure.  I have one which is not
new—one that I picked up off the floor nearly six years ago.  I have
really tried to use it, but my heart failed me, and I could not commit
the extravagance.

Small pieces of butter grieve others.  They cannot attend to conversation
because of the annoyance occasioned by the habit which some people have
of invariably taking more butter than they want.  Have you not seen the
anxious look (almost mesmeric) which such persons fix on the article?
They would feel it a relief if they might bury it out of their sight by
popping it into their own mouths and swallowing it down; and they are
really made happy if the person on whose plate it lies unused suddenly
breaks off a piece of toast (which he does not want at all) and eats up
his butter.  They think that this is not waste.

Now Miss Matty Jenkyns was chary of candles.  We had many devices to use
as few as possible.  In the winter afternoons she would sit knitting for
two or three hours—she could do this in the dark, or by firelight—and
when I asked if I might not ring for candles to finish stitching my
wristbands, she told me to “keep blind man’s holiday.”  They were usually
brought in with tea; but we only burnt one at a time.  As we lived in
constant preparation for a friend who might come in any evening (but who
never did), it required some contrivance to keep our two candles of the
same length, ready to be lighted, and to look as if we burnt two always.
The candles took it in turns; and, whatever we might be talking about or
doing, Miss Matty’s eyes were habitually fixed upon the candle, ready to
jump up and extinguish it and to light the other before they had become
too uneven in length to be restored to equality in the course of the
evening.

One night, I remember this candle economy particularly annoyed me.  I had
been very much tired of my compulsory “blind man’s holiday,” especially
as Miss Matty had fallen asleep, and I did not like to stir the fire and
run the risk of awakening her; so I could not even sit on the rug, and
scorch myself with sewing by firelight, according to my usual custom.  I
fancied Miss Matty must be dreaming of her early life; for she spoke one
or two words in her uneasy sleep bearing reference to persons who were
dead long before.  When Martha brought in the lighted candle and tea,
Miss Matty started into wakefulness, with a strange, bewildered look
around, as if we were not the people she expected to see about her.
There was a little sad expression that shadowed her face as she
recognised me; but immediately afterwards she tried to give me her usual
smile.  All through tea-time her talk ran upon the days of her childhood
and youth.  Perhaps this reminded her of the desirableness of looking
over all the old family letters, and destroying such as ought not to be
allowed to fall into the hands of strangers; for she had often spoken of
the necessity of this task, but had always shrunk from it, with a timid
dread of something painful.  To-night, however, she rose up after tea and
went for them—in the dark; for she piqued herself on the precise neatness
of all her chamber arrangements, and used to look uneasily at me when I
lighted a bed-candle to go to another room for anything.  When she
returned there was a faint, pleasant smell of Tonquin beans in the room.
I had always noticed this scent about any of the things which had
belonged to her mother; and many of the letters were addressed to
her—yellow bundles of love-letters, sixty or seventy years old.

Miss Matty undid the packet with a sigh; but she stifled it directly, as
if it were hardly right to regret the flight of time, or of life either.
We agreed to look them over separately, each taking a different letter
out of the same bundle and describing its contents to the other before
destroying it.  I never knew what sad work the reading of old letters was
before that evening, though I could hardly tell why.  The letters were as
happy as letters could be—at least those early letters were.  There was
in them a vivid and intense sense of the present time, which seemed so
strong and full, as if it could never pass away, and as if the warm,
living hearts that so expressed themselves could never die, and be as
nothing to the sunny earth.  I should have felt less melancholy, I
believe, if the letters had been more so.  I saw the tears stealing down
the well-worn furrows of Miss Matty’s cheeks, and her spectacles often
wanted wiping.  I trusted at last that she would light the other candle,
for my own eyes were rather dim, and I wanted more light to see the pale,
faded ink; but no, even through her tears, she saw and remembered her
little economical ways.

The earliest set of letters were two bundles tied together, and ticketed
(in Miss Jenkyns’s handwriting) “Letters interchanged between my
ever-honoured father and my dearly-beloved mother, prior to their
marriage, in July 1774.”  I should guess that the rector of Cranford was
about twenty-seven years of age when he wrote those letters; and Miss
Matty told me that her mother was just eighteen at the time of her
wedding.  With my idea of the rector derived from a picture in the
dining-parlour, stiff and stately, in a huge full-bottomed wig, with
gown, cassock, and bands, and his hand upon a copy of the only sermon he
ever published—it was strange to read these letters.  They were full of
eager, passionate ardour; short homely sentences, right fresh from the
heart (very different from the grand Latinised, Johnsonian style of the
printed sermon preached before some judge at assize time).  His letters
were a curious contrast to those of his girl-bride.  She was evidently
rather annoyed at his demands upon her for expressions of love, and could
not quite understand what he meant by repeating the same thing over in so
many different ways; but what she was quite clear about was a longing for
a white “Paduasoy”—whatever that might be; and six or seven letters were
principally occupied in asking her lover to use his influence with her
parents (who evidently kept her in good order) to obtain this or that
article of dress, more especially the white “Paduasoy.”  He cared nothing
how she was dressed; she was always lovely enough for him, as he took
pains to assure her, when she begged him to express in his answers a
predilection for particular pieces of finery, in order that she might
show what he said to her parents.  But at length he seemed to find out
that she would not be married till she had a “trousseau” to her mind; and
then he sent her a letter, which had evidently accompanied a whole box
full of finery, and in which he requested that she might be dressed in
everything her heart desired.  This was the first letter, ticketed in a
frail, delicate hand, “From my dearest John.”  Shortly afterwards they
were married, I suppose, from the intermission in their correspondence.

“We must burn them, I think,” said Miss Matty, looking doubtfully at me.
“No one will care for them when I am gone.”  And one by one she dropped
them into the middle of the fire, watching each blaze up, die out, and
rise away, in faint, white, ghostly semblance, up the chimney, before she
gave another to the same fate.  The room was light enough now; but I,
like her, was fascinated into watching the destruction of those letters,
into which the honest warmth of a manly heart had been poured forth.

The next letter, likewise docketed by Miss Jenkyns, was endorsed, “Letter
of pious congratulation and exhortation from my venerable grandfather to
my beloved mother, on occasion of my own birth.  Also some practical
remarks on the desirability of keeping warm the extremities of infants,
from my excellent grandmother.”

The first part was, indeed, a severe and forcible picture of the
responsibilities of mothers, and a warning against the evils that were in
the world, and lying in ghastly wait for the little baby of two days old.
His wife did not write, said the old gentleman, because he had forbidden
it, she being indisposed with a sprained ankle, which (he said) quite
incapacitated her from holding a pen.  However, at the foot of the page
was a small “T.O.,” and on turning it over, sure enough, there was a
letter to “my dear, dearest Molly,” begging her, when she left her room,
whatever she did, to go _up_ stairs before going _down_: and telling her
to wrap her baby’s feet up in flannel, and keep it warm by the fire,
although it was summer, for babies were so tender.

It was pretty to see from the letters, which were evidently exchanged
with some frequency between the young mother and the grandmother, how the
girlish vanity was being weeded out of her heart by love for her baby.
The white “Paduasoy” figured again in the letters, with almost as much
vigour as before.  In one, it was being made into a christening cloak for
the baby.  It decked it when it went with its parents to spend a day or
two at Arley Hall.  It added to its charms, when it was “the prettiest
little baby that ever was seen.  Dear mother, I wish you could see her!
Without any pershality, I do think she will grow up a regular bewty!”  I
thought of Miss Jenkyns, grey, withered, and wrinkled, and I wondered if
her mother had known her in the courts of heaven: and then I knew that
she had, and that they stood there in angelic guise.

There was a great gap before any of the rector’s letters appeared.  And
then his wife had changed her mode of her endorsement.  It was no longer
from, “My dearest John;” it was from “My Honoured Husband.”  The letters
were written on occasion of the publication of the same sermon which was
represented in the picture.  The preaching before “My Lord Judge,” and
the “publishing by request,” was evidently the culminating point—the
event of his life.  It had been necessary for him to go up to London to
superintend it through the press.  Many friends had to be called upon and
consulted before he could decide on any printer fit for so onerous a
task; and at length it was arranged that J. and J. Rivingtons were to
have the honourable responsibility.  The worthy rector seemed to be
strung up by the occasion to a high literary pitch, for he could hardly
write a letter to his wife without cropping out into Latin.  I remember
the end of one of his letters ran thus: “I shall ever hold the virtuous
qualities of my Molly in remembrance, _dum memor ipse mei_, _dum spiritus
regit artus_,” which, considering that the English of his correspondent
was sometimes at fault in grammar, and often in spelling, might be taken
as a proof of how much he “idealised his Molly;” and, as Miss Jenkyns
used to say, “People talk a great deal about idealising now-a-days,
whatever that may mean.”  But this was nothing to a fit of writing
classical poetry which soon seized him, in which his Molly figured away
as “Maria.”  The letter containing the _carmen_ was endorsed by her,
“Hebrew verses sent me by my honoured husband.  I thowt to have had a
letter about killing the pig, but must wait.  Mem., to send the poetry to
Sir Peter Arley, as my husband desires.”  And in a post-scriptum note in
his handwriting it was stated that the Ode had appeared in the
_Gentleman’s Magazine_, December 1782.

Her letters back to her husband (treasured as fondly by him as if they
had been _M. T. Ciceronis Epistolæ_) were more satisfactory to an absent
husband and father than his could ever have been to her.  She told him
how Deborah sewed her seam very neatly every day, and read to her in the
books he had set her; how she was a very “forrard,” good child, but would
ask questions her mother could not answer, but how she did not let
herself down by saying she did not know, but took to stirring the fire,
or sending the “forrard” child on an errand.  Matty was now the mother’s
darling, and promised (like her sister at her age), to be a great beauty.
I was reading this aloud to Miss Matty, who smiled and sighed a little at
the hope, so fondly expressed, that “little Matty might not be vain, even
if she were a bewty.”

“I had very pretty hair, my dear,” said Miss Matilda; “and not a bad
mouth.”  And I saw her soon afterwards adjust her cap and draw herself
up.

But to return to Mrs Jenkyns’s letters.  She told her husband about the
poor in the parish; what homely domestic medicines she had administered;
what kitchen physic she had sent.  She had evidently held his displeasure
as a rod in pickle over the heads of all the ne’er-do-wells.  She asked
for his directions about the cows and pigs; and did not always obtain
them, as I have shown before.

The kind old grandmother was dead when a little boy was born, soon after
the publication of the sermon; but there was another letter of
exhortation from the grandfather, more stringent and admonitory than
ever, now that there was a boy to be guarded from the snares of the
world.  He described all the various sins into which men might fall,
until I wondered how any man ever came to a natural death.  The gallows
seemed as if it must have been the termination of the lives of most of
the grandfather’s friends and acquaintance; and I was not surprised at
the way in which he spoke of this life being “a vale of tears.”

It seemed curious that I should never have heard of this brother before;
but I concluded that he had died young, or else surely his name would
have been alluded to by his sisters.

By-and-by we came to packets of Miss Jenkyns’s letters.  These Miss Matty
did regret to burn.  She said all the others had been only interesting to
those who loved the writers, and that it seemed as if it would have hurt
her to allow them to fall into the hands of strangers, who had not known
her dear mother, and how good she was, although she did not always spell,
quite in the modern fashion; but Deborah’s letters were so very superior!
Any one might profit by reading them.  It was a long time since she had
read Mrs Chapone, but she knew she used to think that Deborah could have
said the same things quite as well; and as for Mrs Carter! people thought
a deal of her letters, just because she had written “Epictetus,” but she
was quite sure Deborah would never have made use of such a common
expression as “I canna be fashed!”

     [Picture: I made use of the time to think of many other things]

Miss Matty did grudge burning these letters, it was evident.  She would
not let them be carelessly passed over with any quiet reading, and
skipping, to myself.  She took them from me, and even lighted the second
candle in order to read them aloud with a proper emphasis, and without
stumbling over the big words.  Oh dear! how I wanted facts instead of
reflections, before those letters were concluded!  They lasted us two
nights; and I won’t deny that I made use of the time to think of many
other things, and yet I was always at my post at the end of each
sentence.

The rector’s letters, and those of his wife and mother-in-law, had all
been tolerably short and pithy, written in a straight hand, with the
lines very close together.  Sometimes the whole letter was contained on a
mere scrap of paper.  The paper was very yellow, and the ink very brown;
some of the sheets were (as Miss Matty made me observe) the old original
post, with the stamp in the corner representing a post-boy riding for
life and twanging his horn.  The letters of Mrs Jenkyns and her mother
were fastened with a great round red wafer; for it was before Miss
Edgeworth’s “patronage” had banished wafers from polite society.  It was
evident, from the tenor of what was said, that franks were in great
request, and were even used as a means of paying debts by needy members
of Parliament.  The rector sealed his epistles with an immense coat of
arms, and showed by the care with which he had performed this ceremony
that he expected they should be cut open, not broken by any thoughtless
or impatient hand.  Now, Miss Jenkyns’s letters were of a later date in
form and writing.  She wrote on the square sheet which we have learned to
call old-fashioned.  Her hand was admirably calculated, together with her
use of many-syllabled words, to fill up a sheet, and then came the pride
and delight of crossing.  Poor Miss Matty got sadly puzzled with this,
for the words gathered size like snowballs, and towards the end of her
letter Miss Jenkyns used to become quite sesquipedalian.  In one to her
father, slightly theological and controversial in its tone, she had
spoken of Herod, Tetrarch of Idumea.  Miss Matty read it “Herod Petrarch
of Etruria,” and was just as well pleased as if she had been right.

I can’t quite remember the date, but I think it was in 1805 that Miss
Jenkyns wrote the longest series of letters—on occasion of her absence on
a visit to some friends near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  These friends were
intimate with the commandant of the garrison there, and heard from him of
all the preparations that were being made to repel the invasion of
Buonaparte, which some people imagined might take place at the mouth of
the Tyne.  Miss Jenkyns was evidently very much alarmed; and the first
part of her letters was often written in pretty intelligible English,
conveying particulars of the preparations which were made in the family
with whom she was residing against the dreaded event; the bundles of
clothes that were packed up ready for a flight to Alston Moor (a wild
hilly piece of ground between Northumberland and Cumberland); the signal
that was to be given for this flight, and for the simultaneous turning
out of the volunteers under arms—which said signal was to consist (if I
remember rightly) in ringing the church bells in a particular and ominous
manner.  One day, when Miss Jenkyns and her hosts were at a dinner-party
in Newcastle, this warning summons was actually given (not a very wise
proceeding, if there be any truth in the moral attached to the fable of
the Boy and the Wolf; but so it was), and Miss Jenkyns, hardly recovered
from her fright, wrote the next day to describe the sound, the breathless
shock, the hurry and alarm; and then, taking breath, she added, “How
trivial, my dear father, do all our apprehensions of the last evening
appear, at the present moment, to calm and enquiring minds!”  And here
Miss Matty broke in with—

“But, indeed, my dear, they were not at all trivial or trifling at the
time.  I know I used to wake up in the night many a time and think I
heard the tramp of the French entering Cranford.  Many people talked of
hiding themselves in the salt mines—and meat would have kept capitally
down there, only perhaps we should have been thirsty.  And my father
preached a whole set of sermons on the occasion; one set in the mornings,
all about David and Goliath, to spirit up the people to fighting with
spades or bricks, if need were; and the other set in the afternoons,
proving that Napoleon (that was another name for Bony, as we used to call
him) was all the same as an Apollyon and Abaddon.  I remember my father
rather thought he should be asked to print this last set; but the parish
had, perhaps, had enough of them with hearing.”

Peter Marmaduke Arley Jenkyns (“poor Peter!” as Miss Matty began to call
him) was at school at Shrewsbury by this time.  The rector took up his
pen, and rubbed up his Latin once more, to correspond with his boy.  It
was very clear that the lad’s were what are called show letters.  They
were of a highly mental description, giving an account of his studies,
and his intellectual hopes of various kinds, with an occasional quotation
from the classics; but, now and then, the animal nature broke out in such
a little sentence as this, evidently written in a trembling hurry, after
the letter had been inspected: “Mother dear, do send me a cake, and put
plenty of citron in.”  The “mother dear” probably answered her boy in the
form of cakes and “goody,” for there were none of her letters among this
set; but a whole collection of the rector’s, to whom the Latin in his
boy’s letters was like a trumpet to the old war-horse.  I do not know
much about Latin, certainly, and it is, perhaps, an ornamental language,
but not very useful, I think—at least to judge from the bits I remember
out of the rector’s letters.  One was, “You have not got that town in
your map of Ireland; but _Bonus Bernardus non videt omnia_, as the
Proverbia say.”  Presently it became very evident that “poor Peter” got
himself into many scrapes.  There were letters of stilted penitence to
his father, for some wrong-doing; and among them all was a badly-written,
badly-sealed, badly-directed, blotted note:—“My dear, dear, dear, dearest
mother, I will be a better boy; I will, indeed; but don’t, please, be ill
for me; I am not worth it; but I will be good, darling mother.”

Miss Matty could not speak for crying, after she had read this note.  She
gave it to me in silence, and then got up and took it to her sacred
recesses in her own room, for fear, by any chance, it might get burnt.
“Poor Peter!” she said; “he was always in scrapes; he was too easy.  They
led him wrong, and then left him in the lurch.  But he was too fond of
mischief.  He could never resist a joke.  Poor Peter!”




CHAPTER VI—POOR PETER


POOR Peter’s career lay before him rather pleasantly mapped out by kind
friends, but _Bonus Bernardus non videt omnia_, in this map too.  He was
to win honours at the Shrewsbury School, and carry them thick to
Cambridge, and after that, a living awaited him, the gift of his
godfather, Sir Peter Arley.  Poor Peter! his lot in life was very
different to what his friends had hoped and planned.  Miss Matty told me
all about it, and I think it was a relief when she had done so.

He was the darling of his mother, who seemed to dote on all her children,
though she was, perhaps, a little afraid of Deborah’s superior
acquirements.  Deborah was the favourite of her father, and when Peter
disappointed him, she became his pride.  The sole honour Peter brought
away from Shrewsbury was the reputation of being the best good fellow
that ever was, and of being the captain of the school in the art of
practical joking.  His father was disappointed, but set about remedying
the matter in a manly way.  He could not afford to send Peter to read
with any tutor, but he could read with him himself; and Miss Matty told
me much of the awful preparations in the way of dictionaries and lexicons
that were made in her father’s study the morning Peter began.

“My poor mother!” said she.  “I remember how she used to stand in the
hall, just near enough the study-door, to catch the tone of my father’s
voice.  I could tell in a moment if all was going right, by her face.
And it did go right for a long time.”

“What went wrong at last?” said I.  “That tiresome Latin, I dare say.”

“No! it was not the Latin.  Peter was in high favour with my father, for
he worked up well for him.  But he seemed to think that the Cranford
people might be joked about, and made fun of, and they did not like it;
nobody does.  He was always hoaxing them; ‘hoaxing’ is not a pretty word,
my dear, and I hope you won’t tell your father I used it, for I should
not like him to think that I was not choice in my language, after living
with such a woman as Deborah.  And be sure you never use it yourself.  I
don’t know how it slipped out of my mouth, except it was that I was
thinking of poor Peter and it was always his expression.  But he was a
very gentlemanly boy in many things.  He was like dear Captain Brown in
always being ready to help any old person or a child.  Still, he did like
joking and making fun; and he seemed to think the old ladies in Cranford
would believe anything.  There were many old ladies living here then; we
are principally ladies now, I know, but we are not so old as the ladies
used to be when I was a girl.  I could laugh to think of some of Peter’s
jokes.  No, my dear, I won’t tell you of them, because they might not
shock you as they ought to do, and they were very shocking.  He even took
in my father once, by dressing himself up as a lady that was passing
through the town and wished to see the Rector of Cranford, ‘who had
published that admirable Assize Sermon.’  Peter said he was awfully
frightened himself when he saw how my father took it all in, and even
offered to copy out all his Napoleon Buonaparte sermons for her—him, I
mean—no, her, for Peter was a lady then.  He told me he was more
terrified than he ever was before, all the time my father was speaking.
He did not think my father would have believed him; and yet if he had
not, it would have been a sad thing for Peter.  As it was, he was none so
glad of it, for my father kept him hard at work copying out all those
twelve Buonaparte sermons for the lady—that was for Peter himself, you
know.  He was the lady.  And once when he wanted to go fishing, Peter
said, ‘Confound the woman!’—very bad language, my dear, but Peter was not
always so guarded as he should have been; my father was so angry with
him, it nearly frightened me out of my wits: and yet I could hardly keep
from laughing at the little curtseys Peter kept making, quite slyly,
whenever my father spoke of the lady’s excellent taste and sound
discrimination.”

                      [Picture: Confound the woman]

“Did Miss Jenkyns know of these tricks?” said I.

“Oh, no!  Deborah would have been too much shocked.  No, no one knew but
me.  I wish I had always known of Peter’s plans; but sometimes he did not
tell me.  He used to say the old ladies in the town wanted something to
talk about; but I don’t think they did.  They had the _St James’s
Chronicle_ three times a week, just as we have now, and we have plenty to
say; and I remember the clacking noise there always was when some of the
ladies got together.  But, probably, schoolboys talk more than ladies.
At last there was a terrible, sad thing happened.”  Miss Matty got up,
went to the door, and opened it; no one was there.  She rang the bell for
Martha, and when Martha came, her mistress told her to go for eggs to a
farm at the other end of the town.

“I will lock the door after you, Martha.  You are not afraid to go, are
you?”

“No, ma’am, not at all; Jem Hearn will be only too proud to go with me.”

Miss Matty drew herself up, and as soon as we were alone, she wished that
Martha had more maidenly reserve.

“We’ll put out the candle, my dear.  We can talk just as well by
firelight, you know.  There!  Well, you see, Deborah had gone from home
for a fortnight or so; it was a very still, quiet day, I remember,
overhead; and the lilacs were all in flower, so I suppose it was spring.
My father had gone out to see some sick people in the parish; I recollect
seeing him leave the house with his wig and shovel-hat and cane.  What
possessed our poor Peter I don’t know; he had the sweetest temper, and
yet he always seemed to like to plague Deborah.  She never laughed at his
jokes, and thought him ungenteel, and not careful enough about improving
his mind; and that vexed him.

“Well! he went to her room, it seems, and dressed himself in her old
gown, and shawl, and bonnet; just the things she used to wear in
Cranford, and was known by everywhere; and he made the pillow into a
little—you are sure you locked the door, my dear, for I should not like
anyone to hear—into—into a little baby, with white long clothes.  It was
only, as he told me afterwards, to make something to talk about in the
town; he never thought of it as affecting Deborah.  And he went and
walked up and down in the Filbert walk—just half-hidden by the rails, and
half-seen; and he cuddled his pillow, just like a baby, and talked to it
all the nonsense people do.  Oh dear! and my father came stepping stately
up the street, as he always did; and what should he see but a little
black crowd of people—I daresay as many as twenty—all peeping through his
garden rails.  So he thought, at first, they were only looking at a new
rhododendron that was in full bloom, and that he was very proud of; and
he walked slower, that they might have more time to admire.  And he
wondered if he could make out a sermon from the occasion, and thought,
perhaps, there was some relation between the rhododendrons and the lilies
of the field.  My poor father!  When he came nearer, he began to wonder
that they did not see him; but their heads were all so close together,
peeping and peeping!  My father was amongst them, meaning, he said, to
ask them to walk into the garden with him, and admire the beautiful
vegetable production, when—oh, my dear, I tremble to think of it—he
looked through the rails himself, and saw—I don’t know what he thought he
saw, but old Clare told me his face went quite grey-white with anger, and
his eyes blazed out under his frowning black brows; and he spoke out—oh,
so terribly!—and bade them all stop where they were—not one of them to
go, not one of them to stir a step; and, swift as light, he was in at the
garden door, and down the Filbert walk, and seized hold of poor Peter,
and tore his clothes off his back—bonnet, shawl, gown, and all—and threw
the pillow among the people over the railings: and then he was very, very
angry indeed, and before all the people he lifted up his cane and flogged
Peter!

“My dear, that boy’s trick, on that sunny day, when all seemed going
straight and well, broke my mother’s heart, and changed my father for
life.  It did, indeed.  Old Clare said, Peter looked as white as my
father; and stood as still as a statue to be flogged; and my father
struck hard!  When my father stopped to take breath, Peter said, ‘Have
you done enough, sir?’ quite hoarsely, and still standing quite quiet.  I
don’t know what my father said—or if he said anything.  But old Clare
said, Peter turned to where the people outside the railing were, and made
them a low bow, as grand and as grave as any gentleman; and then walked
slowly into the house.  I was in the store-room helping my mother to make
cowslip wine.  I cannot abide the wine now, nor the scent of the flowers;
they turn me sick and faint, as they did that day, when Peter came in,
looking as haughty as any man—indeed, looking like a man, not like a boy.
‘Mother!’ he said, ‘I am come to say, God bless you for ever.’  I saw his
lips quiver as he spoke; and I think he durst not say anything more
loving, for the purpose that was in his heart.  She looked at him rather
frightened, and wondering, and asked him what was to do.  He did not
smile or speak, but put his arms round her and kissed her as if he did
not know how to leave off; and before she could speak again, he was gone.
We talked it over, and could not understand it, and she bade me go and
seek my father, and ask what it was all about.  I found him walking up
and down, looking very highly displeased.

“‘Tell your mother I have flogged Peter, and that he richly deserved it.’

“I durst not ask any more questions.  When I told my mother, she sat
down, quite faint, for a minute.  I remember, a few days after, I saw the
poor, withered cowslip flowers thrown out to the leaf heap, to decay and
die there.  There was no making of cowslip wine that year at the
rectory—nor, indeed, ever after.

“Presently my mother went to my father.  I know I thought of Queen Esther
and King Ahasuerus; for my mother was very pretty and delicate-looking,
and my father looked as terrible as King Ahasuerus.  Some time after they
came out together; and then my mother told me what had happened, and that
she was going up to Peter’s room at my father’s desire—though she was not
to tell Peter this—to talk the matter over with him.  But no Peter was
there.  We looked over the house; no Peter was there!  Even my father,
who had not liked to join in the search at first, helped us before long.
The rectory was a very old house—steps up into a room, steps down into a
room, all through.  At first, my mother went calling low and soft, as if
to reassure the poor boy, ‘Peter!  Peter, dear! it’s only me;’ but,
by-and-by, as the servants came back from the errands my father had sent
them, in different directions, to find where Peter was—as we found he was
not in the garden, nor the hayloft, nor anywhere about—my mother’s cry
grew louder and wilder, Peter!  Peter, my darling! where are you?’ for
then she felt and understood that that long kiss meant some sad kind of
‘good-bye.’  The afternoon went on—my mother never resting, but seeking
again and again in every possible place that had been looked into twenty
times before, nay, that she had looked into over and over again herself.
My father sat with his head in his hands, not speaking except when his
messengers came in, bringing no tidings; then he lifted up his face, so
strong and sad, and told them to go again in some new direction.  My
mother kept passing from room to room, in and out of the house, moving
noiselessly, but never ceasing.  Neither she nor my father durst leave
the house, which was the meeting-place for all the messengers.  At last
(and it was nearly dark), my father rose up.  He took hold of my mother’s
arm as she came with wild, sad pace through one door, and quickly towards
another.  She started at the touch of his hand, for she had forgotten all
in the world but Peter.

“‘Molly!’ said he, ‘I did not think all this would happen.’  He looked
into her face for comfort—her poor face all wild and white; for neither
she nor my father had dared to acknowledge—much less act upon—the terror
that was in their hearts, lest Peter should have made away with himself.
My father saw no conscious look in his wife’s hot, dreary eyes, and he
missed the sympathy that she had always been ready to give him—strong man
as he was, and at the dumb despair in her face his tears began to flow.
But when she saw this, a gentle sorrow came over her countenance, and she
said, ‘Dearest John! don’t cry; come with me, and we’ll find him,’ almost
as cheerfully as if she knew where he was.  And she took my father’s
great hand in her little soft one, and led him along, the tears dropping
as he walked on that same unceasing, weary walk, from room to room,
through house and garden.

“Oh, how I wished for Deborah!  I had no time for crying, for now all
seemed to depend on me.  I wrote for Deborah to come home.  I sent a
message privately to that same Mr Holbrook’s house—poor Mr Holbrook;—you
know who I mean.  I don’t mean I sent a message to him, but I sent one
that I could trust to know if Peter was at his house.  For at one time Mr
Holbrook was an occasional visitor at the rectory—you know he was Miss
Pole’s cousin—and he had been very kind to Peter, and taught him how to
fish—he was very kind to everybody, and I thought Peter might have gone
off there.  But Mr Holbrook was from home, and Peter had never been seen.
It was night now; but the doors were all wide open, and my father and
mother walked on and on; it was more than an hour since he had joined
her, and I don’t believe they had ever spoken all that time.  I was
getting the parlour fire lighted, and one of the servants was preparing
tea, for I wanted them to have something to eat and drink and warm them,
when old Clare asked to speak to me.

“‘I have borrowed the nets from the weir, Miss Matty.  Shall we drag the
ponds to-night, or wait for the morning?’

“I remember staring in his face to gather his meaning; and when I did, I
laughed out loud.  The horror of that new thought—our bright, darling
Peter, cold, and stark, and dead!  I remember the ring of my own laugh
now.

“The next day Deborah was at home before I was myself again.  She would
not have been so weak as to give way as I had done; but my screams (my
horrible laughter had ended in crying) had roused my sweet dear mother,
whose poor wandering wits were called back and collected as soon as a
child needed her care.  She and Deborah sat by my bedside; I knew by the
looks of each that there had been no news of Peter—no awful, ghastly
news, which was what I most had dreaded in my dull state between sleeping
and waking.

“The same result of all the searching had brought something of the same
relief to my mother, to whom, I am sure, the thought that Peter might
even then be hanging dead in some of the familiar home places had caused
that never-ending walk of yesterday.  Her soft eyes never were the same
again after that; they had always a restless, craving look, as if seeking
for what they could not find.  Oh! it was an awful time; coming down like
a thunder-bolt on the still sunny day when the lilacs were all in bloom.”

“Where was Mr Peter?” said I.

“He had made his way to Liverpool; and there was war then; and some of
the king’s ships lay off the mouth of the Mersey; and they were only too
glad to have a fine likely boy such as him (five foot nine he was), come
to offer himself.  The captain wrote to my father, and Peter wrote to my
mother.  Stay! those letters will be somewhere here.”

We lighted the candle, and found the captain’s letter and Peter’s too.
And we also found a little simple begging letter from Mrs Jenkyns to
Peter, addressed to him at the house of an old schoolfellow whither she
fancied he might have gone.  They had returned it unopened; and unopened
it had remained ever since, having been inadvertently put by among the
other letters of that time.  This is it:—

    “MY DEAREST PETER,—You did not think we should be so sorry as we are,
    I know, or you would never have gone away.  You are too good.  Your
    father sits and sighs till my heart aches to hear him.  He cannot
    hold up his head for grief; and yet he only did what he thought was
    right.  Perhaps he has been too severe, and perhaps I have not been
    kind enough; but God knows how we love you, my dear only boy.  Don
    looks so sorry you are gone.  Come back, and make us happy, who love
    you so much.  I know you will come back.”

But Peter did not come back.  That spring day was the last time he ever
saw his mother’s face.  The writer of the letter—the last—the only person
who had ever seen what was written in it, was dead long ago; and I, a
stranger, not born at the time when this occurrence took place, was the
one to open it.

The captain’s letter summoned the father and mother to Liverpool
instantly, if they wished to see their boy; and, by some of the wild
chances of life, the captain’s letter had been detained somewhere,
somehow.

Miss Matty went on, “And it was racetime, and all the post-horses at
Cranford were gone to the races; but my father and mother set off in our
own gig—and oh! my dear, they were too late—the ship was gone!  And now
read Peter’s letter to my mother!”

It was full of love, and sorrow, and pride in his new profession, and a
sore sense of his disgrace in the eyes of the people at Cranford; but
ending with a passionate entreaty that she would come and see him before
he left the Mersey: “Mother; we may go into battle.  I hope we shall, and
lick those French: but I must see you again before that time.”

“And she was too late,” said Miss Matty; “too late!”

We sat in silence, pondering on the full meaning of those sad, sad words.
At length I asked Miss Matty to tell me how her mother bore it.

“Oh!” she said, “she was patience itself.  She had never been strong, and
this weakened her terribly.  My father used to sit looking at her: far
more sad than she was.  He seemed as if he could look at nothing else
when she was by; and he was so humble—so very gentle now.  He would,
perhaps, speak in his old way—laying down the law, as it were—and then,
in a minute or two, he would come round and put his hand on our
shoulders, and ask us in a low voice, if he had said anything to hurt us.
I did not wonder at his speaking so to Deborah, for she was so clever;
but I could not bear to hear him talking so to me.

“But, you see, he saw what we did not—that it was killing my mother.
Yes! killing her (put out the candle, my dear; I can talk better in the
dark), for she was but a frail woman, and ill-fitted to stand the fright
and shock she had gone through; and she would smile at him and comfort
him, not in words, but in her looks and tones, which were always cheerful
when he was there.  And she would speak of how she thought Peter stood a
good chance of being admiral very soon—he was so brave and clever; and
how she thought of seeing him in his navy uniform, and what sort of hats
admirals wore; and how much more fit he was to be a sailor than a
clergyman; and all in that way, just to make my father think she was
quite glad of what came of that unlucky morning’s work, and the flogging
which was always in his mind, as we all knew.  But oh, my dear! the
bitter, bitter crying she had when she was alone; and at last, as she
grew weaker, she could not keep her tears in when Deborah or me was by,
and would give us message after message for Peter (his ship had gone to
the Mediterranean, or somewhere down there, and then he was ordered off
to India, and there was no overland route then); but she still said that
no one knew where their death lay in wait, and that we were not to think
hers was near.  We did not think it, but we knew it, as we saw her fading
away.

“Well, my dear, it’s very foolish of me, I know, when in all likelihood I
am so near seeing her again.

“And only think, love! the very day after her death—for she did not live
quite a twelvemonth after Peter went away—the very day after—came a
parcel for her from India—from her poor boy.  It was a large, soft, white
Indian shawl, with just a little narrow border all round; just what my
mother would have liked.

“We thought it might rouse my father, for he had sat with her hand in his
all night long; so Deborah took it in to him, and Peter’s letter to her,
and all.  At first, he took no notice; and we tried to make a kind of
light careless talk about the shawl, opening it out and admiring it.
Then, suddenly, he got up, and spoke: ‘She shall be buried in it,’ he
said; ‘Peter shall have that comfort; and she would have liked it.’

“Well, perhaps it was not reasonable, but what could we do or say?  One
gives people in grief their own way.  He took it up and felt it: ‘It is
just such a shawl as she wished for when she was married, and her mother
did not give it her.  I did not know of it till after, or she should have
had it—she should; but she shall have it now.’

“My mother looked so lovely in her death!  She was always pretty, and now
she looked fair, and waxen, and young—younger than Deborah, as she stood
trembling and shivering by her.  We decked her in the long soft folds;
she lay smiling, as if pleased; and people came—all Cranford came—to beg
to see her, for they had loved her dearly, as well they might; and the
countrywomen brought posies; old Clare’s wife brought some white violets
and begged they might lie on her breast.

“Deborah said to me, the day of my mother’s funeral, that if she had a
hundred offers she never would marry and leave my father.  It was not
very likely she would have so many—I don’t know that she had one; but it
was not less to her credit to say so.  She was such a daughter to my
father as I think there never was before or since.  His eyes failed him,
and she read book after book, and wrote, and copied, and was always at
his service in any parish business.  She could do many more things than
my poor mother could; she even once wrote a letter to the bishop for my
father.  But he missed my mother sorely; the whole parish noticed it.
Not that he was less active; I think he was more so, and more patient in
helping every one.  I did all I could to set Deborah at liberty to be
with him; for I knew I was good for little, and that my best work in the
world was to do odd jobs quietly, and set others at liberty.  But my
father was a changed man.”

“Did Mr Peter ever come home?”

“Yes, once.  He came home a lieutenant; he did not get to be admiral.
And he and my father were such friends!  My father took him into every
house in the parish, he was so proud of him.  He never walked out without
Peter’s arm to lean upon.  Deborah used to smile (I don’t think we ever
laughed again after my mother’s death), and say she was quite put in a
corner.  Not but what my father always wanted her when there was
letter-writing or reading to be done, or anything to be settled.”

“And then?” said I, after a pause.

“Then Peter went to sea again; and, by-and-by, my father died, blessing
us both, and thanking Deborah for all she had been to him; and, of
course, our circumstances were changed; and, instead of living at the
rectory, and keeping three maids and a man, we had to come to this small
house, and be content with a servant-of-all-work; but, as Deborah used to
say, we have always lived genteelly, even if circumstances have compelled
us to simplicity.  Poor Deborah!”

“And Mr Peter?” asked I.

“Oh, there was some great war in India—I forget what they call it—and we
have never heard of Peter since then.  I believe he is dead myself; and
it sometimes fidgets me that we have never put on mourning for him.  And
then again, when I sit by myself, and all the house is still, I think I
hear his step coming up the street, and my heart begins to flutter and
beat; but the sound always goes past—and Peter never comes.

“That’s Martha back?  No!  _I’ll_ go, my dear; I can always find my way
in the dark, you know.  And a blow of fresh air at the door will do my
head good, and it’s rather got a trick of aching.”

So she pattered off.  I had lighted the candle, to give the room a
cheerful appearance against her return.

“Was it Martha?” asked I.

“Yes.  And I am rather uncomfortable, for I heard such a strange noise,
just as I was opening the door.”

“Where?’ I asked, for her eyes were round with affright.

“In the street—just outside—it sounded like”—

“Talking?” I put in, as she hesitated a little.

“No! kissing”—




CHAPTER VII—VISITING


ONE morning, as Miss Matty and I sat at our work—it was before twelve
o’clock, and Miss Matty had not changed the cap with yellow ribbons that
had been Miss Jenkyns’s best, and which Miss Matty was now wearing out in
private, putting on the one made in imitation of Mrs Jamieson’s at all
times when she expected to be seen—Martha came up, and asked if Miss
Betty Barker might speak to her mistress.  Miss Matty assented, and
quickly disappeared to change the yellow ribbons, while Miss Barker came
upstairs; but, as she had forgotten her spectacles, and was rather
flurried by the unusual time of the visit, I was not surprised to see her
return with one cap on the top of the other.  She was quite unconscious
of it herself, and looked at us, with bland satisfaction.  Nor do I think
Miss Barker perceived it; for, putting aside the little circumstance that
she was not so young as she had been, she was very much absorbed in her
errand, which she delivered herself of with an oppressive modesty that
found vent in endless apologies.

Miss Betty Barker was the daughter of the old clerk at Cranford who had
officiated in Mr Jenkyns’s time.  She and her sister had had pretty good
situations as ladies’ maids, and had saved money enough to set up a
milliner’s shop, which had been patronised by the ladies in the
neighbourhood.  Lady Arley, for instance, would occasionally give Miss
Barkers the pattern of an old cap of hers, which they immediately copied
and circulated among the _élite_ of Cranford.  I say the _élite_, for
Miss Barkers had caught the trick of the place, and piqued themselves
upon their “aristocratic connection.”  They would not sell their caps and
ribbons to anyone without a pedigree.  Many a farmer’s wife or daughter
turned away huffed from Miss Barkers’ select millinery, and went rather
to the universal shop, where the profits of brown soap and moist sugar
enabled the proprietor to go straight to (Paris, he said, until he found
his customers too patriotic and John Bullish to wear what the Mounseers
wore) London, where, as he often told his customers, Queen Adelaide had
appeared, only the very week before, in a cap exactly like the one he
showed them, trimmed with yellow and blue ribbons, and had been
complimented by King William on the becoming nature of her head-dress.

Miss Barkers, who confined themselves to truth, and did not approve of
miscellaneous customers, throve notwithstanding.  They were self-denying,
good people.  Many a time have I seen the eldest of them (she that had
been maid to Mrs Jamieson) carrying out some delicate mess to a poor
person.  They only aped their betters in having “nothing to do” with the
class immediately below theirs.  And when Miss Barker died, their profits
and income were found to be such that Miss Betty was justified in
shutting up shop and retiring from business.  She also (as I think I have
before said) set up her cow; a mark of respectability in Cranford almost
as decided as setting up a gig is among some people.  She dressed finer
than any lady in Cranford; and we did not wonder at it; for it was
understood that she was wearing out all the bonnets and caps and
outrageous ribbons which had once formed her stock-in-trade.  It was five
or six years since she had given up shop, so in any other place than
Cranford her dress might have been considered _passée_.

And now Miss Betty Barker had called to invite Miss Matty to tea at her
house on the following Tuesday.  She gave me also an impromptu
invitation, as I happened to be a visitor—though I could see she had a
little fear lest, since my father had gone to live in Drumble, he might
have engaged in that “horrid cotton trade,” and so dragged his family
down out of “aristocratic society.”  She prefaced this invitation with so
many apologies that she quite excited my curiosity.  “Her presumption”
was to be excused.  What had she been doing?  She seemed so over-powered
by it I could only think that she had been writing to Queen Adelaide to
ask for a receipt for washing lace; but the act which she so
characterised was only an invitation she had carried to her sister’s
former mistress, Mrs Jamieson.  “Her former occupation considered, could
Miss Matty excuse the liberty?”  Ah! thought I, she has found out that
double cap, and is going to rectify Miss Matty’s head-dress.  No! it was
simply to extend her invitation to Miss Matty and to me.  Miss Matty
bowed acceptance; and I wondered that, in the graceful action, she did
not feel the unusual weight and extraordinary height of her head-dress.
But I do not think she did, for she recovered her balance, and went on
talking to Miss Betty in a kind, condescending manner, very different
from the fidgety way she would have had if she had suspected how singular
her appearance was.  “Mrs Jamieson is coming, I think you said?” asked
Miss Matty.

“Yes.  Mrs Jamieson most kindly and condescendingly said she would be
happy to come.  One little stipulation she made, that she should bring
Carlo.  I told her that if I had a weakness, it was for dogs.”

“And Miss Pole?” questioned Miss Matty, who was thinking of her pool at
Preference, in which Carlo would not be available as a partner.

“I am going to ask Miss Pole.  Of course, I could not think of asking her
until I had asked you, madam—the rector’s daughter, madam.  Believe me, I
do not forget the situation my father held under yours.”

“And Mrs Forrester, of course?”

“And Mrs Forrester.  I thought, in fact, of going to her before I went to
Miss Pole.  Although her circumstances are changed, madam, she was born
at Tyrrell, and we can never forget her alliance to the Bigges, of
Bigelow Hall.”

Miss Matty cared much more for the little circumstance of her being a
very good card-player.

“Mrs Fitz-Adam—I suppose”—

“No, madam.  I must draw a line somewhere.  Mrs Jamieson would not, I
think, like to meet Mrs Fitz-Adam.  I have the greatest respect for Mrs
Fitz-Adam—but I cannot think her fit society for such ladies as Mrs
Jamieson and Miss Matilda Jenkyns.”

Miss Betty Barker bowed low to Miss Matty, and pursed up her mouth.  She
looked at me with sidelong dignity, as much as to say, although a retired
milliner, she was no democrat, and understood the difference of ranks.

“May I beg you to come as near half-past six to my little dwelling, as
possible, Miss Matilda?  Mrs Jamieson dines at five, but has kindly
promised not to delay her visit beyond that time—half-past six.”  And
with a swimming curtsey Miss Betty Barker took her leave.

My prophetic soul foretold a visit that afternoon from Miss Pole, who
usually came to call on Miss Matilda after any event—or indeed in sight
of any event—to talk it over with her.

“Miss Betty told me it was to be a choice and select few,” said Miss
Pole, as she and Miss Matty compared notes.

“Yes, so she said.  Not even Mrs Fitz-Adam.”

Now Mrs Fitz-Adam was the widowed sister of the Cranford surgeon, whom I
have named before.  Their parents were respectable farmers, content with
their station.  The name of these good people was Hoggins.  Mr Hoggins
was the Cranford doctor now; we disliked the name and considered it
coarse; but, as Miss Jenkyns said, if he changed it to Piggins it would
not be much better.  We had hoped to discover a relationship between him
and that Marchioness of Exeter whose name was Molly Hoggins; but the man,
careless of his own interests, utterly ignored and denied any such
relationship, although, as dear Miss Jenkyns had said, he had a sister
called Mary, and the same Christian names were very apt to run in
families.

Soon after Miss Mary Hoggins married Mr Fitz-Adam, she disappeared from
the neighbourhood for many years.  She did not move in a sphere in
Cranford society sufficiently high to make any of us care to know what Mr
Fitz-Adam was.  He died and was gathered to his fathers without our ever
having thought about him at all.  And then Mrs Fitz-Adam reappeared in
Cranford (“as bold as a lion,” Miss Pole said), a well-to-do widow,
dressed in rustling black silk, so soon after her husband’s death that
poor Miss Jenkyns was justified in the remark she made, that “bombazine
would have shown a deeper sense of her loss.”

I remember the convocation of ladies who assembled to decide whether or
not Mrs Fitz-Adam should be called upon by the old blue-blooded
inhabitants of Cranford.  She had taken a large rambling house, which had
been usually considered to confer a patent of gentility upon its tenant,
because, once upon a time, seventy or eighty years before, the spinster
daughter of an earl had resided in it.  I am not sure if the inhabiting
this house was not also believed to convey some unusual power of
intellect; for the earl’s daughter, Lady Jane, had a sister, Lady Anne,
who had married a general officer in the time of the American war, and
this general officer had written one or two comedies, which were still
acted on the London boards, and which, when we saw them advertised, made
us all draw up, and feel that Drury Lane was paying a very pretty
compliment to Cranford.  Still, it was not at all a settled thing that
Mrs Fitz-Adam was to be visited, when dear Miss Jenkyns died; and, with
her, something of the clear knowledge of the strict code of gentility
went out too.  As Miss Pole observed, “As most of the ladies of good
family in Cranford were elderly spinsters, or widows without children, if
we did not relax a little, and become less exclusive, by-and-by we should
have no society at all.”

Mrs Forrester continued on the same side.

“She had always understood that Fitz meant something aristocratic; there
was Fitz-Roy—she thought that some of the King’s children had been called
Fitz-Roy; and there was Fitz-Clarence, now—they were the children of dear
good King William the Fourth.  Fitz-Adam!—it was a pretty name, and she
thought it very probably meant ‘Child of Adam.’  No one, who had not some
good blood in their veins, would dare to be called Fitz; there was a deal
in a name—she had had a cousin who spelt his name with two little
ffs—ffoulkes—and he always looked down upon capital letters and said they
belonged to lately-invented families.  She had been afraid he would die a
bachelor, he was so very choice.  When he met with a Mrs ffarringdon, at
a watering-place, he took to her immediately; and a very pretty genteel
woman she was—a widow, with a very good fortune; and ‘my cousin,’ Mr
ffoulkes, married her; and it was all owing to her two little ffs.”

Mrs Fitz-Adam did not stand a chance of meeting with a Mr Fitz-anything
in Cranford, so that could not have been her motive for settling there.
Miss Matty thought it might have been the hope of being admitted into the
society of the place, which would certainly be a very agreeable rise for
_ci-devant_ Miss Hoggins; and if this had been her hope it would be cruel
to disappoint her.

So everybody called upon Mrs Fitz-Adam—everybody but Mrs Jamieson, who
used to show how honourable she was by never seeing Mrs Fitz-Adam when
they met at the Cranford parties.  There would be only eight or ten
ladies in the room, and Mrs Fitz-Adam was the largest of all, and she
invariably used to stand up when Mrs Jamieson came in, and curtsey very
low to her whenever she turned in her direction—so low, in fact, that I
think Mrs Jamieson must have looked at the wall above her, for she never
moved a muscle of her face, no more than if she had not seen her.  Still
Mrs Fitz-Adam persevered.

The spring evenings were getting bright and long when three or four
ladies in calashes met at Miss Barker’s door.  Do you know what a calash
is?  It is a covering worn over caps, not unlike the heads fastened on
old-fashioned gigs; but sometimes it is not quite so large.  This kind of
head-gear always made an awful impression on the children in Cranford;
and now two or three left off their play in the quiet sunny little
street, and gathered in wondering silence round Miss Pole, Miss Matty,
and myself.  We were silent too, so that we could hear loud, suppressed
whispers inside Miss Barker’s house: “Wait, Peggy! wait till I’ve run
upstairs and washed my hands.  When I cough, open the door; I’ll not be a
minute.”

And, true enough it was not a minute before we heard a noise, between a
sneeze and a crow; on which the door flew open.  Behind it stood a
round-eyed maiden, all aghast at the honourable company of calashes, who
marched in without a word.  She recovered presence of mind enough to
usher us into a small room, which had been the shop, but was now
converted into a temporary dressing-room.  There we unpinned and shook
ourselves, and arranged our features before the glass into a sweet and
gracious company-face; and then, bowing backwards with “After you,
ma’am,” we allowed Mrs Forrester to take precedence up the narrow
staircase that led to Miss Barker’s drawing-room.  There she sat, as
stately and composed as though we had never heard that odd-sounding
cough, from which her throat must have been even then sore and rough.
Kind, gentle, shabbily-dressed Mrs Forrester was immediately conducted to
the second place of honour—a seat arranged something like Prince Albert’s
near the Queen’s—good, but not so good.  The place of pre-eminence was,
of course, reserved for the Honourable Mrs Jamieson, who presently came
panting up the stairs—Carlo rushing round her on her progress, as if he
meant to trip her up.

And now Miss Betty Barker was a proud and happy woman!  She stirred the
fire, and shut the door, and sat as near to it as she could, quite on the
edge of her chair.  When Peggy came in, tottering under the weight of the
tea-tray, I noticed that Miss Barker was sadly afraid lest Peggy should
not keep her distance sufficiently.  She and her mistress were on very
familiar terms in their every-day intercourse, and Peggy wanted now to
make several little confidences to her, which Miss Barker was on thorns
to hear, but which she thought it her duty, as a lady, to repress.  So
she turned away from all Peggy’s asides and signs; but she made one or
two very malapropos answers to what was said; and at last, seized with a
bright idea, she exclaimed, “Poor, sweet Carlo!  I’m forgetting him.
Come downstairs with me, poor ittie doggie, and it shall have its tea, it
shall!”

In a few minutes she returned, bland and benignant as before; but I
thought she had forgotten to give the “poor ittie doggie” anything to
eat, judging by the avidity with which he swallowed down chance pieces of
cake.  The tea-tray was abundantly loaded—I was pleased to see it, I was
so hungry; but I was afraid the ladies present might think it vulgarly
heaped up.  I know they would have done at their own houses; but somehow
the heaps disappeared here.  I saw Mrs Jamieson eating seed-cake, slowly
and considerately, as she did everything; and I was rather surprised, for
I knew she had told us, on the occasion of her last party, that she never
had it in her house, it reminded her so much of scented soap.  She always
gave us Savoy biscuits.  However, Mrs Jamieson was kindly indulgent to
Miss Barker’s want of knowledge of the customs of high life; and, to
spare her feelings, ate three large pieces of seed-cake, with a placid,
ruminating expression of countenance, not unlike a cow’s.

After tea there was some little demur and difficulty.  We were six in
number; four could play at Preference, and for the other two there was
Cribbage.  But all, except myself (I was rather afraid of the Cranford
ladies at cards, for it was the most earnest and serious business they
ever engaged in), were anxious to be of the “pool.”  Even Miss Barker,
while declaring she did not know Spadille from Manille, was evidently
hankering to take a hand.  The dilemma was soon put an end to by a
singular kind of noise.  If a baron’s daughter-in-law could ever be
supposed to snore, I should have said Mrs Jamieson did so then; for,
overcome by the heat of the room, and inclined to doze by nature, the
temptation of that very comfortable arm-chair had been too much for her,
and Mrs Jamieson was nodding.  Once or twice she opened her eyes with an
effort, and calmly but unconsciously smiled upon us; but by-and-by, even
her benevolence was not equal to this exertion, and she was sound asleep.

 [Picture: The temptation of the comfortable arm-chair had been too much
                                 for her]

“It is very gratifying to me,” whispered Miss Barker at the card-table to
her three opponents, whom, notwithstanding her ignorance of the game, she
was “basting” most unmercifully—“very gratifying indeed, to see how
completely Mrs Jamieson feels at home in my poor little dwelling; she
could not have paid me a greater compliment.”

Miss Barker provided me with some literature in the shape of three or
four handsomely-bound fashion-books ten or twelve years old, observing,
as she put a little table and a candle for my especial benefit, that she
knew young people liked to look at pictures.  Carlo lay and snorted, and
started at his mistress’s feet.  He, too, was quite at home.

The card-table was an animated scene to watch; four ladies’ heads, with
niddle-noddling caps, all nearly meeting over the middle of the table in
their eagerness to whisper quick enough and loud enough: and every now
and then came Miss Barker’s “Hush, ladies! if you please, hush!  Mrs
Jamieson is asleep.”

It was very difficult to steer clear between Mrs Forrester’s deafness and
Mrs Jamieson’s sleepiness.  But Miss Barker managed her arduous task
well.  She repeated the whisper to Mrs Forrester, distorting her face
considerably, in order to show, by the motions of her lips, what was
said; and then she smiled kindly all round at us, and murmured to
herself, “Very gratifying, indeed; I wish my poor sister had been alive
to see this day.”

Presently the door was thrown wide open; Carlo started to his feet, with
a loud snapping bark, and Mrs Jamieson awoke: or, perhaps, she had not
been asleep—as she said almost directly, the room had been so light she
had been glad to keep her eyes shut, but had been listening with great
interest to all our amusing and agreeable conversation.  Peggy came in
once more, red with importance.  Another tray!  “Oh, gentility!” thought
I, “can yon endure this last shock?”  For Miss Barker had ordered (nay, I
doubt not, prepared, although she did say, “Why, Peggy, what have you
brought us?” and looked pleasantly surprised at the unexpected pleasure)
all sorts of good things for supper—scalloped oysters, potted lobsters,
jelly, a dish called “little Cupids” (which was in great favour with the
Cranford ladies, although too expensive to be given, except on solemn and
state occasions—macaroons sopped in brandy, I should have called it, if I
had not known its more refined and classical name).  In short, we were
evidently to be feasted with all that was sweetest and best; and we
thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our
gentility—which never ate suppers in general, but which, like most
non-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.

Miss Barker, in her former sphere, had, I daresay, been made acquainted
with the beverage they call cherry-brandy.  We none of us had ever seen
such a thing, and rather shrank back when she proffered it us—“just a
little, leetle glass, ladies; after the oysters and lobsters, you know.
Shell-fish are sometimes thought not very wholesome.”  We all shook our
heads like female mandarins; but, at last, Mrs Jamieson suffered herself
to be persuaded, and we followed her lead.  It was not exactly
unpalatable, though so hot and so strong that we thought ourselves bound
to give evidence that we were not accustomed to such things by coughing
terribly—almost as strangely as Miss Barker had done, before we were
admitted by Peggy.

“It’s very strong,” said Miss Pole, as she put down her empty glass; “I
do believe there’s spirit in it.”

“Only a little drop—just necessary to make it keep,” said Miss Barker.
“You know we put brandy-pepper over our preserves to make them keep.  I
often feel tipsy myself from eating damson tart.”

I question whether damson tart would have opened Mrs Jamieson’s heart as
the cherry-brandy did; but she told us of a coming event, respecting
which she had been quite silent till that moment.

“My sister-in-law, Lady Glenmire, is coming to stay with me.”

There was a chorus of “Indeed!” and then a pause.  Each one rapidly
reviewed her wardrobe, as to its fitness to appear in the presence of a
baron’s widow; for, of course, a series of small festivals were always
held in Cranford on the arrival of a visitor at any of our friends’
houses.  We felt very pleasantly excited on the present occasion.

Not long after this the maids and the lanterns were announced.  Mrs
Jamieson had the sedan-chair, which had squeezed itself into Miss
Barker’s narrow lobby with some difficulty, and most literally “stopped
the way.”  It required some skilful manoeuvring on the part of the old
chairmen (shoemakers by day, but when summoned to carry the sedan dressed
up in a strange old livery—long great-coats, with small capes, coeval
with the sedan, and similar to the dress of the class in Hogarth’s
pictures) to edge, and back, and try at it again, and finally to succeed
in carrying their burden out of Miss Barker’s front door.  Then we heard
their quick pit-a-pat along the quiet little street as we put on our
calashes and pinned up our gowns; Miss Barker hovering about us with
offers of help, which, if she had not remembered her former occupation,
and wished us to forget it, would have been much more pressing.




CHAPTER VIII—“YOUR LADYSHIP”


EARLY the next morning—directly after twelve—Miss Pole made her
appearance at Miss Matty’s.  Some very trifling piece of business was
alleged as a reason for the call; but there was evidently something
behind.  At last out it came.

“By the way, you’ll think I’m strangely ignorant; but, do you really
know, I am puzzled how we ought to address Lady Glenmire.  Do you say,
‘Your Ladyship,’ where you would say ‘you’ to a common person?  I have
been puzzling all morning; and are we to say ‘My Lady,’ instead of
‘Ma’am?’  Now you knew Lady Arley—will you kindly tell me the most
correct way of speaking to the peerage?”

Poor Miss Matty! she took off her spectacles and she put them on
again—but how Lady Arley was addressed, she could not remember.

“It is so long ago,” she said.  “Dear! dear! how stupid I am!  I don’t
think I ever saw her more than twice.  I know we used to call Sir Peter,
‘Sir Peter’—but he came much oftener to see us than Lady Arley did.
Deborah would have known in a minute.  ‘My lady’—‘your ladyship.’  It
sounds very strange, and as if it was not natural.  I never thought of it
before; but, now you have named it, I am all in a puzzle.”

It was very certain Miss Pole would obtain no wise decision from Miss
Matty, who got more bewildered every moment, and more perplexed as to
etiquettes of address.

“Well, I really think,” said Miss Pole, “I had better just go and tell
Mrs Forrester about our little difficulty.  One sometimes grows nervous;
and yet one would not have Lady Glenmire think we were quite ignorant of
the etiquettes of high life in Cranford.”

“And will you just step in here, dear Miss Pole, as you come back,
please, and tell me what you decide upon?  Whatever you and Mrs Forrester
fix upon, will be quite right, I’m sure.  ‘Lady Arley,’ ‘Sir Peter,’”
said Miss Matty to herself, trying to recall the old forms of words.

“Who is Lady Glenmire?” asked I.

“Oh, she’s the widow of Mr Jamieson—that’s Mrs Jamieson’s late husband,
you know—widow of his eldest brother.  Mrs Jamieson was a Miss Walker,
daughter of Governor Walker.  ‘Your ladyship.’  My dear, if they fix on
that way of speaking, you must just let me practice a little on you
first, for I shall feel so foolish and hot saying it the first time to
Lady Glenmire.”

It was really a relief to Miss Matty when Mrs Jamieson came on a very
unpolite errand.  I notice that apathetic people have more quiet
impertinence than others; and Mrs Jamieson came now to insinuate pretty
plainly that she did not particularly wish that the Cranford ladies
should call upon her sister-in-law.  I can hardly say how she made this
clear; for I grew very indignant and warm, while with slow deliberation
she was explaining her wishes to Miss Matty, who, a true lady herself,
could hardly understand the feeling which made Mrs Jamieson wish to
appear to her noble sister-in-law as if she only visited “county”
families.  Miss Matty remained puzzled and perplexed long after I had
found out the object of Mrs Jamieson’s visit.

When she did understand the drift of the honourable lady’s call, it was
pretty to see with what quiet dignity she received the intimation thus
uncourteously given.  She was not in the least hurt—she was of too gentle
a spirit for that; nor was she exactly conscious of disapproving of Mrs
Jamieson’s conduct; but there was something of this feeling in her mind,
I am sure, which made her pass from the subject to others in a less
flurried and more composed manner than usual.  Mrs Jamieson was, indeed,
the more flurried of the two, and I could see she was glad to take her
leave.

A little while afterwards Miss Pole returned, red and indignant.  “Well!
to be sure!  You’ve had Mrs Jamieson here, I find from Martha; and we are
not to call on Lady Glenmire.  Yes!  I met Mrs Jamieson, half-way between
here and Mrs Forrester’s, and she told me; she took me so by surprise, I
had nothing to say.  I wish I had thought of something very sharp and
sarcastic; I dare say I shall to-night.  And Lady Glenmire is but the
widow of a Scotch baron after all!  I went on to look at Mrs Forrester’s
Peerage, to see who this lady was, that is to be kept under a glass case:
widow of a Scotch peer—never sat in the House of Lords—and as poor as
Job, I dare say; and she—fifth daughter of some Mr Campbell or other.
You are the daughter of a rector, at any rate, and related to the Arleys;
and Sir Peter might have been Viscount Arley, every one says.”

Miss Matty tried to soothe Miss Pole, but in vain.  That lady, usually so
kind and good-humoured, was now in a full flow of anger.

“And I went and ordered a cap this morning, to be quite ready,” said she
at last, letting out the secret which gave sting to Mrs Jamieson’s
intimation.  “Mrs Jamieson shall see if it is so easy to get me to make
fourth at a pool when she has none of her fine Scotch relations with
her!”

In coming out of church, the first Sunday on which Lady Glenmire appeared
in Cranford, we sedulously talked together, and turned our backs on Mrs
Jamieson and her guest.  If we might not call on her, we would not even
look at her, though we were dying with curiosity to know what she was
like.  We had the comfort of questioning Martha in the afternoon.  Martha
did not belong to a sphere of society whose observation could be an
implied compliment to Lady Glenmire, and Martha had made good use of her
eyes.

“Well, ma’am! is it the little lady with Mrs Jamieson, you mean?  I
thought you would like more to know how young Mrs Smith was dressed; her
being a bride.”  (Mrs Smith was the butcher’s wife).

Miss Pole said, “Good gracious me! as if we cared about a Mrs Smith;” but
was silent as Martha resumed her speech.

“The little lady in Mrs Jamieson’s pew had on, ma’am, rather an old black
silk, and a shepherd’s plaid cloak, ma’am, and very bright black eyes she
had, ma’am, and a pleasant, sharp face; not over young, ma’am, but yet, I
should guess, younger than Mrs Jamieson herself.  She looked up and down
the church, like a bird, and nipped up her petticoats, when she came out,
as quick and sharp as ever I see.  I’ll tell you what, ma’am, she’s more
like Mrs Deacon, at the ‘Coach and Horses,’ nor any one.”

“Hush, Martha!” said Miss Matty, “that’s not respectful.”

“Isn’t it, ma’am?  I beg pardon, I’m sure; but Jem Hearn said so as well.
He said, she was just such a sharp, stirring sort of a body”—

“Lady,” said Miss Pole.

“Lady—as Mrs Deacon.”

Another Sunday passed away, and we still averted our eyes from Mrs
Jamieson and her guest, and made remarks to ourselves that we thought
were very severe—almost too much so.  Miss Matty was evidently uneasy at
our sarcastic manner of speaking.

Perhaps by this time Lady Glenmire had found out that Mrs Jamieson’s was
not the gayest, liveliest house in the world; perhaps Mrs Jamieson had
found out that most of the county families were in London, and that those
who remained in the country were not so alive as they might have been to
the circumstance of Lady Glenmire being in their neighbourhood.  Great
events spring out of small causes; so I will not pretend to say what
induced Mrs Jamieson to alter her determination of excluding the Cranford
ladies, and send notes of invitation all round for a small party on the
following Tuesday.  Mr Mulliner himself brought them round.  He _would_
always ignore the fact of there being a back-door to any house, and gave
a louder rat-tat than his mistress, Mrs Jamieson.  He had three little
notes, which he carried in a large basket, in order to impress his
mistress with an idea of their great weight, though they might easily
have gone into his waistcoat pocket.

Miss Matty and I quietly decided that we would have a previous engagement
at home: it was the evening on which Miss Matty usually made
candle-lighters of all the notes and letters of the week; for on Mondays
her accounts were always made straight—not a penny owing from the week
before; so, by a natural arrangement, making candle-lighters fell upon a
Tuesday evening, and gave us a legitimate excuse for declining Mrs
Jamieson’s invitation.  But before our answer was written, in came Miss
Pole, with an open note in her hand.

“So!” she said.  “Ah!  I see you have got your note, too.  Better late
than never.  I could have told my Lady Glenmire she would be glad enough
of our society before a fortnight was over.”

“Yes,” said Miss Matty, “we’re asked for Tuesday evening.  And perhaps
you would just kindly bring your work across and drink tea with us that
night.  It is my usual regular time for looking over the last week’s
bills, and notes, and letters, and making candle-lighters of them; but
that does not seem quite reason enough for saying I have a previous
engagement at home, though I meant to make it do.  Now, if you would
come, my conscience would be quite at ease, and luckily the note is not
written yet.”

I saw Miss Pole’s countenance change while Miss Matty was speaking.

“Don’t you mean to go then?” asked she.

“Oh, no!” said, Miss Matty quietly.  “You don’t either, I suppose?”

“I don’t know,” replied Miss Pole.  “Yes, I think I do,” said she, rather
briskly; and on seeing Miss Matty look surprised, she added, “You see,
one would not like Mrs Jamieson to think that anything she could do, or
say, was of consequence enough to give offence; it would be a kind of
letting down of ourselves, that I, for one, should not like.  It would be
too flattering to Mrs Jamieson if we allowed her to suppose that what she
had said affected us a week, nay ten days afterwards.”

“Well!  I suppose it is wrong to be hurt and annoyed so long about
anything; and, perhaps, after all, she did not mean to vex us.  But I
must say, I could not have brought myself to say the things Mrs Jamieson
did about our not calling.  I really don’t think I shall go.”

“Oh, come!  Miss Matty, you must go; you know our friend Mrs Jamieson is
much more phlegmatic than most people, and does not enter into the little
delicacies of feeling which you possess in so remarkable a degree.”

“I thought you possessed them, too, that day Mrs Jamieson called to tell
us not to go,” said Miss Matty innocently.

But Miss Pole, in addition to her delicacies of feeling, possessed a very
smart cap, which she was anxious to show to an admiring world; and so she
seemed to forget all her angry words uttered not a fortnight before, and
to be ready to act on what she called the great Christian principle of
“Forgive and forget”; and she lectured dear Miss Matty so long on this
head that she absolutely ended by assuring her it was her duty, as a
deceased rector’s daughter, to buy a new cap and go to the party at Mrs
Jamieson’s.  So “we were most happy to accept,” instead of “regretting
that we were obliged to decline.”

                          [Picture: Mr Mulliner]

The expenditure on dress in Cranford was principally in that one article
referred to.  If the heads were buried in smart new caps, the ladies were
like ostriches, and cared not what became of their bodies.  Old gowns,
white and venerable collars, any number of brooches, up and down and
everywhere (some with dogs’ eyes painted in them; some that were like
small picture-frames with mausoleums and weeping-willows neatly executed
in hair inside; some, again, with miniatures of ladies and gentlemen
sweetly smiling out of a nest of stiff muslin), old brooches for a
permanent ornament, and new caps to suit the fashion of the day—the
ladies of Cranford always dressed with chaste elegance and propriety, as
Miss Barker once prettily expressed it.

And with three new caps, and a greater array of brooches than had ever
been seen together at one time since Cranford was a town, did Mrs
Forrester, and Miss Matty, and Miss Pole appear on that memorable Tuesday
evening.  I counted seven brooches myself on Miss Pole’s dress.  Two were
fixed negligently in her cap (one was a butterfly made of Scotch pebbles,
which a vivid imagination might believe to be the real insect); one
fastened her net neckerchief; one her collar; one ornamented the front of
her gown, midway between her throat and waist; and another adorned the
point of her stomacher.  Where the seventh was I have forgotten, but it
was somewhere about her, I am sure.

But I am getting on too fast, in describing the dresses of the company.
I should first relate the gathering on the way to Mrs Jamieson’s.  That
lady lived in a large house just outside the town.  A road which had
known what it was to be a street ran right before the house, which opened
out upon it without any intervening garden or court.  Whatever the sun
was about, he never shone on the front of that house.  To be sure, the
living-rooms were at the back, looking on to a pleasant garden; the front
windows only belonged to kitchens and housekeepers’ rooms, and pantries,
and in one of them Mr Mulliner was reported to sit.  Indeed, looking
askance, we often saw the back of a head covered with hair powder, which
also extended itself over his coat-collar down to his very waist; and
this imposing back was always engaged in reading the _St James’s
Chronicle_, opened wide, which, in some degree, accounted for the length
of time the said newspaper was in reaching us—equal subscribers with Mrs
Jamieson, though, in right of her honourableness, she always had the
reading of it first.  This very Tuesday, the delay in forwarding the last
number had been particularly aggravating; just when both Miss Pole and
Miss Matty, the former more especially, had been wanting to see it, in
order to coach up the Court news ready for the evening’s interview with
aristocracy.  Miss Pole told us she had absolutely taken time by the
forelock, and been dressed by five o’clock, in order to be ready if the
_St James’s Chronicle_ should come in at the last moment—the very _St
James’s Chronicle_ which the powdered head was tranquilly and composedly
reading as we passed the accustomed window this evening.

“The impudence of the man!” said Miss Pole, in a low indignant whisper.
“I should like to ask him whether his mistress pays her quarter-share for
his exclusive use.”

We looked at her in admiration of the courage of her thought; for Mr
Mulliner was an object of great awe to all of us.  He seemed never to
have forgotten his condescension in coming to live at Cranford.  Miss
Jenkyns, at times, had stood forth as the undaunted champion of her sex,
and spoken to him on terms of equality; but even Miss Jenkyns could get
no higher.  In his pleasantest and most gracious moods he looked like a
sulky cockatoo.  He did not speak except in gruff monosyllables.  He
would wait in the hall when we begged him not to wait, and then look
deeply offended because we had kept him there, while, with trembling,
hasty hands we prepared ourselves for appearing in company.

Miss Pole ventured on a small joke as we went upstairs, intended, though
addressed to us, to afford Mr Mulliner some slight amusement.  We all
smiled, in order to seem as if we felt at our ease, and timidly looked
for Mr Mulliner’s sympathy.  Not a muscle of that wooden face had
relaxed; and we were grave in an instant.

Mrs Jamieson’s drawing-room was cheerful; the evening sun came streaming
into it, and the large square window was clustered round with flowers.
The furniture was white and gold; not the later style, Louis Quatorze, I
think they call it, all shells and twirls; no, Mrs Jamieson’s chairs and
tables had not a curve or bend about them.  The chair and table legs
diminished as they neared the ground, and were straight and square in all
their corners.  The chairs were all a-row against the walls, with the
exception of four or five which stood in a circle round the fire.  They
were railed with white bars across the back and knobbed with gold;
neither the railings nor the knobs invited to ease.  There was a japanned
table devoted to literature, on which lay a Bible, a Peerage, and a
Prayer-Book.  There was another square Pembroke table dedicated to the
Fine Arts, on which were a kaleidoscope, conversation-cards, puzzle-cards
(tied together to an interminable length with faded pink satin ribbon),
and a box painted in fond imitation of the drawings which decorate
tea-chests.  Carlo lay on the worsted-worked rug, and ungraciously barked
at us as we entered.  Mrs Jamieson stood up, giving us each a torpid
smile of welcome, and looking helplessly beyond us at Mr Mulliner, as if
she hoped he would place us in chairs, for, if he did not, she never
could.  I suppose he thought we could find our way to the circle round
the fire, which reminded me of Stonehenge, I don’t know why.  Lady
Glenmire came to the rescue of our hostess, and, somehow or other, we
found ourselves for the first time placed agreeably, and not formally, in
Mrs Jamieson’s house.  Lady Glenmire, now we had time to look at her,
proved to be a bright little woman of middle age, who had been very
pretty in the days of her youth, and who was even yet very
pleasant-looking.  I saw Miss Pole appraising her dress in the first five
minutes, and I take her word when she said the next day—

“My dear! ten pounds would have purchased every stitch she had on—lace
and all.”

It was pleasant to suspect that a peeress could be poor, and partly
reconciled us to the fact that her husband had never sat in the House of
Lords; which, when we first heard of it, seemed a kind of swindling us
out of our prospects on false pretences; a sort of “A Lord and No Lord”
business.

We were all very silent at first.  We were thinking what we could talk
about, that should be high enough to interest My Lady.  There had been a
rise in the price of sugar, which, as preserving-time was near, was a
piece of intelligence to all our house-keeping hearts, and would have
been the natural topic if Lady Glenmire had not been by.  But we were not
sure if the peerage ate preserves—much less knew how they were made.  At
last, Miss Pole, who had always a great deal of courage and _savoir
faire_, spoke to Lady Glenmire, who on her part had seemed just as much
puzzled to know how to break the silence as we were.

“Has your ladyship been to Court lately?” asked she; and then gave a
little glance round at us, half timid and half triumphant, as much as to
say, “See how judiciously I have chosen a subject befitting the rank of
the stranger.”

“I never was there in my life,” said Lady Glenmire, with a broad Scotch
accent, but in a very sweet voice.  And then, as if she had been too
abrupt, she added: “We very seldom went to London—only twice, in fact,
during all my married life; and before I was married my father had far
too large a family” (fifth daughter of Mr Campbell was in all our minds,
I am sure) “to take us often from our home, even to Edinburgh.  Ye’ll
have been in Edinburgh, maybe?” said she, suddenly brightening up with
the hope of a common interest.  We had none of us been there; but Miss
Pole had an uncle who once had passed a night there, which was very
pleasant.

Mrs Jamieson, meanwhile, was absorbed in wonder why Mr Mulliner did not
bring the tea; and at length the wonder oozed out of her mouth.

“I had better ring the bell, my dear, had not I?” said Lady Glenmire
briskly.

“No—I think not—Mulliner does not like to be hurried.”

We should have liked our tea, for we dined at an earlier hour than Mrs
Jamieson.  I suspect Mr Mulliner had to finish the _St James’s Chronicle_
before he chose to trouble himself about tea.  His mistress fidgeted and
fidgeted, and kept saying, “I can’t think why Mulliner does not bring
tea.  I can’t think what he can be about.”  And Lady Glenmire at last
grew quite impatient, but it was a pretty kind of impatience after all;
and she rang the bell rather sharply, on receiving a half-permission from
her sister-in-law to do so.  Mr Mulliner appeared in dignified surprise.
“Oh!” said Mrs Jamieson, “Lady Glenmire rang the bell; I believe it was
for tea.”

In a few minutes tea was brought.  Very delicate was the china, very old
the plate, very thin the bread and butter, and very small the lumps of
sugar.  Sugar was evidently Mrs Jamieson’s favourite economy.  I question
if the little filigree sugar-tongs, made something like scissors, could
have opened themselves wide enough to take up an honest, vulgar
good-sized piece; and when I tried to seize two little minnikin pieces at
once, so as not to be detected in too many returns to the sugar-basin,
they absolutely dropped one, with a little sharp clatter, quite in a
malicious and unnatural manner.  But before this happened we had had a
slight disappointment.  In the little silver jug was cream, in the larger
one was milk.  As soon as Mr Mulliner came in, Carlo began to beg, which
was a thing our manners forebade us to do, though I am sure we were just
as hungry; and Mrs Jamieson said she was certain we would excuse her if
she gave her poor dumb Carlo his tea first.  She accordingly mixed a
saucerful for him, and put it down for him to lap; and then she told us
how intelligent and sensible the dear little fellow was; he knew cream
quite well, and constantly refused tea with only milk in it: so the milk
was left for us; but we silently thought we were quite as intelligent and
sensible as Carlo, and felt as if insult were added to injury when we
were called upon to admire the gratitude evinced by his wagging his tail
for the cream which should have been ours.

After tea we thawed down into common-life subjects.  We were thankful to
Lady Glenmire for having proposed some more bread and butter, and this
mutual want made us better acquainted with her than we should ever have
been with talking about the Court, though Miss Pole did say she had hoped
to know how the dear Queen was from some one who had seen her.

The friendship begun over bread and butter extended on to cards.  Lady
Glenmire played Preference to admiration, and was a complete authority as
to Ombre and Quadrille.  Even Miss Pole quite forgot to say “my lady,”
and “your ladyship,” and said “Basto! ma’am”; “you have Spadille, I
believe,” just as quietly as if we had never held the great Cranford
Parliament on the subject of the proper mode of addressing a peeress.

As a proof of how thoroughly we had forgotten that we were in the
presence of one who might have sat down to tea with a coronet, instead of
a cap, on her head, Mrs Forrester related a curious little fact to Lady
Glenmire—an anecdote known to the circle of her intimate friends, but of
which even Mrs Jamieson was not aware.  It related to some fine old lace,
the sole relic of better days, which Lady Glenmire was admiring on Mrs
Forrester’s collar.

“Yes,” said that lady, “such lace cannot be got now for either love or
money; made by the nuns abroad, they tell me.  They say that they can’t
make it now even there.  But perhaps they can, now they’ve passed the
Catholic Emancipation Bill.  I should not wonder.  But, in the meantime,
I treasure up my lace very much.  I daren’t even trust the washing of it
to my maid” (the little charity school-girl I have named before, but who
sounded well as “my maid”).  “I always wash it myself.  And once it had a
narrow escape.  Of course, your ladyship knows that such lace must never
be starched or ironed.  Some people wash it in sugar and water, and some
in coffee, to make it the right yellow colour; but I myself have a very
good receipt for washing it in milk, which stiffens it enough, and gives
it a very good creamy colour.  Well, ma’am, I had tacked it together (and
the beauty of this fine lace is that, when it is wet, it goes into a very
little space), and put it to soak in milk, when, unfortunately, I left
the room; on my return, I found pussy on the table, looking very like a
thief, but gulping very uncomfortably, as if she was half-chocked with
something she wanted to swallow and could not.  And, would you believe
it?  At first I pitied her, and said ‘Poor pussy! poor pussy!’ till, all
at once, I looked and saw the cup of milk empty—cleaned out!  ‘You
naughty cat!’ said I, and I believe I was provoked enough to give her a
slap, which did no good, but only helped the lace down—just as one slaps
a choking child on the back.  I could have cried, I was so vexed; but I
determined I would not give the lace up without a struggle for it.  I
hoped the lace might disagree with her, at any rate; but it would have
been too much for Job, if he had seen, as I did, that cat come in, quite
placid and purring, not a quarter of an hour after, and almost expecting
to be stroked.  ‘No, pussy!’ said I, ‘if you have any conscience you
ought not to expect that!’  And then a thought struck me; and I rang the
bell for my maid, and sent her to Mr Hoggins, with my compliments, and
would he be kind enough to lend me one of his top-boots for an hour?  I
did not think there was anything odd in the message; but Jenny said the
young men in the surgery laughed as if they would be ill at my wanting a
top-boot.  When it came, Jenny and I put pussy in, with her forefeet
straight down, so that they were fastened, and could not scratch, and we
gave her a teaspoonful of current-jelly in which (your ladyship must
excuse me) I had mixed some tartar emetic.  I shall never forget how
anxious I was for the next half-hour.  I took pussy to my own room, and
spread a clean towel on the floor.  I could have kissed her when she
returned the lace to sight, very much as it had gone down.  Jenny had
boiling water ready, and we soaked it and soaked it, and spread it on a
lavender-bush in the sun before I could touch it again, even to put it in
milk.  But now your ladyship would never guess that it had been in
pussy’s inside.”

          [Picture: We gave her a teaspoonful of current-jelly]

We found out, in the course of the evening, that Lady Glenmire was going
to pay Mrs Jamieson a long visit, as she had given up her apartments in
Edinburgh, and had no ties to take her back there in a hurry.  On the
whole, we were rather glad to hear this, for she had made a pleasant
impression upon us; and it was also very comfortable to find, from things
which dropped out in the course of conversation, that, in addition to
many other genteel qualities, she was far removed from the “vulgarity of
wealth.”

“Don’t you find it very unpleasant walking?” asked Mrs Jamieson, as our
respective servants were announced.  It was a pretty regular question
from Mrs Jamieson, who had her own carriage in the coach-house, and
always went out in a sedan-chair to the very shortest distances.  The
answers were nearly as much a matter of course.

“Oh dear, no! it is so pleasant and still at night!”  “Such a refreshment
after the excitement of a party!”  “The stars are so beautiful!”  This
last was from Miss Matty.

“Are you fond of astronomy?” Lady Glenmire asked.

“Not very,” replied Miss Matty, rather confused at the moment to remember
which was astronomy and which was astrology—but the answer was true under
either circumstance, for she read, and was slightly alarmed at Francis
Moore’s astrological predictions; and, as to astronomy, in a private and
confidential conversation, she had told me she never could believe that
the earth was moving constantly, and that she would not believe it if she
could, it made her feel so tired and dizzy whenever she thought about it.

In our pattens we picked our way home with extra care that night, so
refined and delicate were our perceptions after drinking tea with “my
lady.”




CHAPTER IX—SIGNOR BRUNONI


SOON after the events of which I gave an account in my last paper, I was
summoned home by my father’s illness; and for a time I forgot, in anxiety
about him, to wonder how my dear friends at Cranford were getting on, or
how Lady Glenmire could reconcile herself to the dulness of the long
visit which she was still paying to her sister-in-law, Mrs Jamieson.
When my father grew a little stronger I accompanied him to the seaside,
so that altogether I seemed banished from Cranford, and was deprived of
the opportunity of hearing any chance intelligence of the dear little
town for the greater part of that year.

Late in November—when we had returned home again, and my father was once
more in good health—I received a letter from Miss Matty; and a very
mysterious letter it was.  She began many sentences without ending them,
running them one into another, in much the same confused sort of way in
which written words run together on blotting-paper.  All I could make out
was that, if my father was better (which she hoped he was), and would
take warning and wear a great-coat from Michaelmas to Lady-day, if
turbans were in fashion, could I tell her?  Such a piece of gaiety was
going to happen as had not been seen or known of since Wombwell’s lions
came, when one of them ate a little child’s arm; and she was, perhaps,
too old to care about dress, but a new cap she must have; and, having
heard that turbans were worn, and some of the county families likely to
come, she would like to look tidy, if I would bring her a cap from the
milliner I employed; and oh, dear! how careless of her to forget that she
wrote to beg I would come and pay her a visit next Tuesday; when she
hoped to have something to offer me in the way of amusement, which she
would not now more particularly describe, only sea-green was her
favourite colour.  So she ended her letter; but in a P.S. she added, she
thought she might as well tell me what was the peculiar attraction to
Cranford just now; Signor Brunoni was going to exhibit his wonderful
magic in the Cranford Assembly Rooms on Wednesday and Friday evening in
the following week.

I was very glad to accept the invitation from my dear Miss Matty,
independently of the conjuror, and most particularly anxious to prevent
her from disfiguring her small, gentle, mousey face with a great
Saracen’s head turban; and accordingly, I bought her a pretty, neat,
middle-aged cap, which, however, was rather a disappointment to her when,
on my arrival, she followed me into my bedroom, ostensibly to poke the
fire, but in reality, I do believe, to see if the sea-green turban was
not inside the cap-box with which I had travelled.  It was in vain that I
twirled the cap round on my hand to exhibit back and side fronts: her
heart had been set upon a turban, and all she could do was to say, with
resignation in her look and voice—

“I am sure you did your best, my dear.  It is just like the caps all the
ladies in Cranford are wearing, and they have had theirs for a year, I
dare say.  I should have liked something newer, I confess—something more
like the turbans Miss Betty Barker tells me Queen Adelaide wears; but it
is very pretty, my dear.  And I dare say lavender will wear better than
sea-green.  Well, after all, what is dress, that we should care anything
about it?  You’ll tell me if you want anything, my dear.  Here is the
bell.  I suppose turbans have not got down to Drumble yet?”

So saying, the dear old lady gently bemoaned herself out of the room,
leaving me to dress for the evening, when, as she informed me, she
expected Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester, and she hoped I should not feel
myself too much tired to join the party.  Of course I should not; and I
made some haste to unpack and arrange my dress; but, with all my speed, I
heard the arrivals and the buzz of conversation in the next room before I
was ready.  Just as I opened the door, I caught the words, “I was foolish
to expect anything very genteel out of the Drumble shops; poor girl! she
did her best, I’ve no doubt.”  But, for all that, I had rather that she
blamed Drumble and me than disfigured herself with a turban.

Miss Pole was always the person, in the trio of Cranford ladies now
assembled, to have had adventures.  She was in the habit of spending the
morning in rambling from shop to shop, not to purchase anything (except
an occasional reel of cotton or a piece of tape), but to see the new
articles and report upon them, and to collect all the stray pieces of
intelligence in the town.  She had a way, too, of demurely popping hither
and thither into all sorts of places to gratify her curiosity on any
point—a way which, if she had not looked so very genteel and prim, might
have been considered impertinent.  And now, by the expressive way in
which she cleared her throat, and waited for all minor subjects (such as
caps and turbans) to be cleared off the course, we knew she had something
very particular to relate, when the due pause came—and I defy any people
possessed of common modesty to keep up a conversation long, where one
among them sits up aloft in silence, looking down upon all the things
they chance to say as trivial and contemptible compared to what they
could disclose, if properly entreated.  Miss Pole began—

“As I was stepping out of Gordon’s shop to-day, I chanced to go into the
‘George’ (my Betty has a second-cousin who is chambermaid there, and I
thought Betty would like to hear how she was), and, not seeing anyone
about, I strolled up the staircase, and found myself in the passage
leading to the Assembly Room (you and I remember the Assembly Room, I am
sure, Miss Matty! and the minuets de la cour!); so I went on, not
thinking of what I was about, when, all at once, I perceived that I was
in the middle of the preparations for to-morrow night—the room being
divided with great clothes-maids, over which Crosby’s men were tacking
red flannel; very dark and odd it seemed; it quite bewildered me, and I
was going on behind the screens, in my absence of mind, when a gentleman
(quite the gentleman, I can assure you) stepped forwards and asked if I
had any business he could arrange for me.  He spoke such pretty broken
English, I could not help thinking of Thaddeus of Warsaw, and the
Hungarian Brothers, and Santo Sebastiani; and while I was busy picturing
his past life to myself, he had bowed me out of the room.  But wait a
minute!  You have not heard half my story yet!  I was going downstairs,
when who should I meet but Betty’s second-cousin.  So, of course, I
stopped to speak to her for Betty’s sake; and she told me that I had
really seen the conjuror—the gentleman who spoke broken English was
Signor Brunoni himself.  Just at this moment he passed us on the stairs,
making such a graceful bow! in reply to which I dropped a curtsey—all
foreigners have such polite manners, one catches something of it.  But
when he had gone downstairs, I bethought me that I had dropped my glove
in the Assembly Room (it was safe in my muff all the time, but I never
found it till afterwards); so I went back, and, just as I was creeping up
the passage left on one side of the great screen that goes nearly across
the room, who should I see but the very same gentleman that had met me
before, and passed me on the stairs, coming now forwards from the inner
part of the room, to which there is no entrance—you remember, Miss
Matty—and just repeating, in his pretty broken English, the inquiry if I
had any business there—I don’t mean that he put it quite so bluntly, but
he seemed very determined that I should not pass the screen—so, of
course, I explained about my glove, which, curiously enough, I found at
that very moment.”

Miss Pole, then, had seen the conjuror—the real, live conjuror! and
numerous were the questions we all asked her.  “Had he a beard?”  “Was he
young, or old?”  “Fair, or dark?”  “Did he look”—(unable to shape my
question prudently, I put it in another form)—“How did he look?”  In
short, Miss Pole was the heroine of the evening, owing to her morning’s
encounter.  If she was not the rose (that is to say the conjuror) she had
been near it.

Conjuration, sleight of hand, magic, witchcraft, were the subjects of the
evening.  Miss Pole was slightly sceptical, and inclined to think there
might be a scientific solution found for even the proceedings of the
Witch of Endor.  Mrs Forrester believed everything, from ghosts to
death-watches.  Miss Matty ranged between the two—always convinced by the
last speaker.  I think she was naturally more inclined to Mrs Forrester’s
side, but a desire of proving herself a worthy sister to Miss Jenkyns
kept her equally balanced—Miss Jenkyns, who would never allow a servant
to call the little rolls of tallow that formed themselves round candles
“winding-sheets,” but insisted on their being spoken of as
“roley-poleys!”  A sister of hers to be superstitious!  It would never
do.

After tea, I was despatched downstairs into the dining-parlour for that
volume of the old Encyclopædia which contained the nouns beginning with
C, in order that Miss Pole might prime herself with scientific
explanations for the tricks of the following evening.  It spoilt the pool
at Preference which Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester had been looking forward
to, for Miss Pole became so much absorbed in her subject, and the plates
by which it was illustrated, that we felt it would be cruel to disturb
her otherwise than by one or two well-timed yawns, which I threw in now
and then, for I was really touched by the meek way in which the two
ladies were bearing their disappointment.  But Miss Pole only read the
more zealously, imparting to us no more information than this—

“Ah! I see; I comprehend perfectly.  A represents the ball.  Put A
between B and D—no! between C and F, and turn the second joint of the
third finger of your left hand over the wrist of your right H.  Very
clear indeed!  My dear Mrs Forrester, conjuring and witchcraft is a mere
affair of the alphabet.  Do let me read you this one passage?”

Mrs Forrester implored Miss Pole to spare her, saying, from a child
upwards, she never could understand being read aloud to; and I dropped
the pack of cards, which I had been shuffling very audibly, and by this
discreet movement I obliged Miss Pole to perceive that Preference was to
have been the order of the evening, and to propose, rather unwillingly,
that the pool should commence.  The pleasant brightness that stole over
the other two ladies’ faces on this!  Miss Matty had one or two twinges
of self-reproach for having interrupted Miss Pole in her studies: and did
not remember her cards well, or give her full attention to the game,
until she had soothed her conscience by offering to lend the volume of
the Encyclopædia to Miss Pole, who accepted it thankfully, and said Betty
should take it home when she came with the lantern.

The next evening we were all in a little gentle flutter at the idea of
the gaiety before us.  Miss Matty went up to dress betimes, and hurried
me until I was ready, when we found we had an hour-and-a-half to wait
before the “doors opened at seven precisely.”  And we had only twenty
yards to go!  However, as Miss Matty said, it would not do to get too
much absorbed in anything, and forget the time; so she thought we had
better sit quietly, without lighting the candles, till five minutes to
seven.  So Miss Matty dozed, and I knitted.

At length we set off; and at the door under the carriage-way at the
“George,” we met Mrs Forrester and Miss Pole: the latter was discussing
the subject of the evening with more vehemence than ever, and throwing
X’s and B’s at our heads like hailstones.  She had even copied one or two
of the “receipts”—as she called them—for the different tricks, on backs
of letters, ready to explain and to detect Signor Brunoni’s arts.

We went into the cloak-room adjoining the Assembly Room; Miss Matty gave
a sigh or two to her departed youth, and the remembrance of the last time
she had been there, as she adjusted her pretty new cap before the
strange, quaint old mirror in the cloak-room.  The Assembly Room had been
added to the inn, about a hundred years before, by the different county
families, who met together there once a month during the winter to dance
and play at cards.  Many a county beauty had first swung through the
minuet that she afterwards danced before Queen Charlotte in this very
room.  It was said that one of the Gunnings had graced the apartment with
her beauty; it was certain that a rich and beautiful widow, Lady
Williams, had here been smitten with the noble figure of a young artist,
who was staying with some family in the neighbourhood for professional
purposes, and accompanied his patrons to the Cranford Assembly.  And a
pretty bargain poor Lady Williams had of her handsome husband, if all
tales were true.  Now, no beauty blushed and dimpled along the sides of
the Cranford Assembly Room; no handsome artist won hearts by his bow,
_chapeau bras_ in hand; the old room was dingy; the salmon-coloured paint
had faded into a drab; great pieces of plaster had chipped off from the
fine wreaths and festoons on its walls; but still a mouldy odour of
aristocracy lingered about the place, and a dusty recollection of the
days that were gone made Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester bridle up as they
entered, and walk mincingly up the room, as if there were a number of
genteel observers, instead of two little boys with a stick of toffee
between them with which to beguile the time.

We stopped short at the second front row; I could hardly understand why,
until I heard Miss Pole ask a stray waiter if any of the county families
were expected; and when he shook his head, and believed not, Mrs
Forrester and Miss Matty moved forwards, and our party represented a
conversational square.  The front row was soon augmented and enriched by
Lady Glenmire and Mrs Jamieson.  We six occupied the two front rows, and
our aristocratic seclusion was respected by the groups of shop-keepers
who strayed in from time to time and huddled together on the back
benches.  At least I conjectured so, from the noise they made, and the
sonorous bumps they gave in sitting down; but when, in weariness of the
obstinate green curtain that would not draw up, but would stare at me
with two odd eyes, seen through holes, as in the old tapestry story, I
would fain have looked round at the merry chattering people behind me,
Miss Pole clutched my arm, and begged me not to turn, for “it was not the
thing.”  What “the thing” was, I never could find out, but it must have
been something eminently dull and tiresome.  However, we all sat eyes
right, square front, gazing at the tantalising curtain, and hardly
speaking intelligibly, we were so afraid of being caught in the vulgarity
of making any noise in a place of public amusement.  Mrs Jamieson was the
most fortunate, for she fell asleep.

At length the eyes disappeared—the curtain quivered—one side went up
before the other, which stuck fast; it was dropped again, and, with a
fresh effort, and a vigorous pull from some unseen hand, it flew up,
revealing to our sight a magnificent gentleman in the Turkish costume,
seated before a little table, gazing at us (I should have said with the
same eyes that I had last seen through the hole in the curtain) with calm
and condescending dignity, “like a being of another sphere,” as I heard a
sentimental voice ejaculate behind me.

“That’s not Signor Brunoni!” said Miss Pole decidedly; and so audibly
that I am sure he heard, for he glanced down over his flowing beard at
our party with an air of mute reproach.  “Signor Brunoni had no beard—but
perhaps he’ll come soon.”  So she lulled herself into patience.
Meanwhile, Miss Matty had reconnoitred through her eye-glass, wiped it,
and looked again.  Then she turned round, and said to me, in a kind,
mild, sorrowful tone—

“You see, my dear, turbans _are_ worn.”

But we had no time for more conversation.  The Grand Turk, as Miss Pole
chose to call him, arose and announced himself as Signor Brunoni.

“I don’t believe him!” exclaimed Miss Pole, in a defiant manner.  He
looked at her again, with the same dignified upbraiding in his
countenance.  “I don’t!” she repeated more positively than ever.  “Signor
Brunoni had not got that muffy sort of thing about his chin, but looked
like a close-shaved Christian gentleman.”

Miss Pole’s energetic speeches had the good effect of wakening up Mrs
Jamieson, who opened her eyes wide, in sign of the deepest attention—a
proceeding which silenced Miss Pole and encouraged the Grand Turk to
proceed, which he did in very broken English—so broken that there was no
cohesion between the parts of his sentences; a fact which he himself
perceived at last, and so left off speaking and proceeded to action.

Now we _were_ astonished.  How he did his tricks I could not imagine; no,
not even when Miss Pole pulled out her pieces of paper and began reading
aloud—or at least in a very audible whisper—the separate “receipts” for
the most common of his tricks.  If ever I saw a man frown and look
enraged, I saw the Grand Turk frown at Miss Pole; but, as she said, what
could be expected but unchristian looks from a Mussulman?  If Miss Pole
were sceptical, and more engrossed with her receipts and diagrams than
with his tricks, Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester were mystified and
perplexed to the highest degree.  Mrs Jamieson kept taking her spectacles
off and wiping them, as if she thought it was something defective in them
which made the legerdemain; and Lady Glenmire, who had seen many curious
sights in Edinburgh, was very much struck with the tricks, and would not
at all agree with Miss Pole, who declared that anybody could do them with
a little practice, and that she would, herself, undertake to do all he
did, with two hours given to study the Encyclopædia and make her third
finger flexible.

At last Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester became perfectly awestricken.  They
whispered together.  I sat just behind them, so I could not help hearing
what they were saying.  Miss Matty asked Mrs Forrester “if she thought it
was quite right to have come to see such things?  She could not help
fearing they were lending encouragement to something that was not quite”—
A little shake of the head filled up the blank.  Mrs Forrester replied,
that the same thought had crossed her mind; she too was feeling very
uncomfortable, it was so very strange.  She was quite certain that it was
her pocket-handkerchief which was in that loaf just now; and it had been
in her own hand not five minutes before.  She wondered who had furnished
the bread?  She was sure it could not be Dakin, because he was the
churchwarden.  Suddenly Miss Matty half-turned towards me—

“Will you look, my dear—you are a stranger in the town, and it won’t give
rise to unpleasant reports—will you just look round and see if the rector
is here?  If he is, I think we may conclude that this wonderful man is
sanctioned by the Church, and that will be a great relief to my mind.”

I looked, and I saw the tall, thin, dry, dusty rector, sitting surrounded
by National School boys, guarded by troops of his own sex from any
approach of the many Cranford spinsters.  His kind face was all agape
with broad smiles, and the boys around him were in chinks of laughing.  I
told Miss Matty that the Church was smiling approval, which set her mind
at ease.

                 [Picture: Afraid of matrimonial reports]

I have never named Mr Hayter, the rector, because I, as a well-to-do and
happy young woman, never came in contact with him.  He was an old
bachelor, but as afraid of matrimonial reports getting abroad about him
as any girl of eighteen: and he would rush into a shop or dive down an
entry, sooner than encounter any of the Cranford ladies in the street;
and, as for the Preference parties, I did not wonder at his not accepting
invitations to them.  To tell the truth, I always suspected Miss Pole of
having given very vigorous chase to Mr Hayter when he first came to
Cranford; and not the less, because now she appeared to share so vividly
in his dread lest her name should ever be coupled with his.  He found all
his interests among the poor and helpless; he had treated the National
School boys this very night to the performance; and virtue was for once
its own reward, for they guarded him right and left, and clung round him
as if he had been the queen-bee and they the swarm.  He felt so safe in
their environment that he could even afford to give our party a bow as we
filed out.  Miss Pole ignored his presence, and pretended to be absorbed
in convincing us that we had been cheated, and had not seen Signor
Brunoni after all.




CHAPTER X—THE PANIC


I THINK a series of circumstances dated from Signor Brunoni’s visit to
Cranford, which seemed at the time connected in our minds with him,
though I don’t know that he had anything really to do with them.  All at
once all sorts of uncomfortable rumours got afloat in the town.  There
were one or two robberies—real _bonâ fide_ robberies; men had up before
the magistrates and committed for trial—and that seemed to make us all
afraid of being robbed; and for a long time, at Miss Matty’s, I know, we
used to make a regular expedition all round the kitchens and cellars
every night, Miss Matty leading the way, armed with the poker, I
following with the hearth-brush, and Martha carrying the shovel and
fire-irons with which to sound the alarm; and by the accidental hitting
together of them she often frightened us so much that we bolted ourselves
up, all three together, in the back-kitchen, or store-room, or wherever
we happened to be, till, when our affright was over, we recollected
ourselves and set out afresh with double valiance.  By day we heard
strange stories from the shopkeepers and cottagers, of carts that went
about in the dead of night, drawn by horses shod with felt, and guarded
by men in dark clothes, going round the town, no doubt in search of some
unwatched house or some unfastened door.

Miss Pole, who affected great bravery herself, was the principal person
to collect and arrange these reports so as to make them assume their most
fearful aspect.  But we discovered that she had begged one of Mr
Hoggins’s worn-out hats to hang up in her lobby, and we (at least I) had
doubts as to whether she really would enjoy the little adventure of
having her house broken into, as she protested she should.  Miss Matty
made no secret of being an arrant coward, but she went regularly through
her housekeeper’s duty of inspection—only the hour for this became
earlier and earlier, till at last we went the rounds at half-past six,
and Miss Matty adjourned to bed soon after seven, “in order to get the
night over the sooner.”

Cranford had so long piqued itself on being an honest and moral town that
it had grown to fancy itself too genteel and well-bred to be otherwise,
and felt the stain upon its character at this time doubly.  But we
comforted ourselves with the assurance which we gave to each other that
the robberies could never have been committed by any Cranford person; it
must have been a stranger or strangers who brought this disgrace upon the
town, and occasioned as many precautions as if we were living among the
Red Indians or the French.

This last comparison of our nightly state of defence and fortification
was made by Mrs Forrester, whose father had served under General Burgoyne
in the American war, and whose husband had fought the French in Spain.
She indeed inclined to the idea that, in some way, the French were
connected with the small thefts, which were ascertained facts, and the
burglaries and highway robberies, which were rumours.  She had been
deeply impressed with the idea of French spies at some time in her life;
and the notion could never be fairly eradicated, but sprang up again from
time to time.  And now her theory was this:—The Cranford people respected
themselves too much, and were too grateful to the aristocracy who were so
kind as to live near the town, ever to disgrace their bringing up by
being dishonest or immoral; therefore, we must believe that the robbers
were strangers—if strangers, why not foreigners?—if foreigners, who so
likely as the French?  Signor Brunoni spoke broken English like a
Frenchman; and, though he wore a turban like a Turk, Mrs Forrester had
seen a print of Madame de Staël with a turban on, and another of Mr Denon
in just such a dress as that in which the conjuror had made his
appearance, showing clearly that the French, as well as the Turks, wore
turbans.  There could be no doubt Signor Brunoni was a Frenchman—a French
spy come to discover the weak and undefended places of England, and
doubtless he had his accomplices.  For her part, she, Mrs Forrester, had
always had her own opinion of Miss Pole’s adventure at the “George
Inn”—seeing two men where only one was believed to be.  French people had
ways and means which, she was thankful to say, the English knew nothing
about; and she had never felt quite easy in her mind about going to see
that conjuror—it was rather too much like a forbidden thing, though the
rector was there.  In short, Mrs Forrester grew more excited than we had
ever known her before, and, being an officer’s daughter and widow, we
looked up to her opinion, of course.

Really I do not know how much was true or false in the reports which flew
about like wildfire just at this time; but it seemed to me then that
there was every reason to believe that at Mardon (a small town about
eight miles from Cranford) houses and shops were entered by holes made in
the walls, the bricks being silently carried away in the dead of the
night, and all done so quietly that no sound was heard either in or out
of the house.  Miss Matty gave it up in despair when she heard of this.
“What was the use,” said she, “of locks and bolts, and bells to the
windows, and going round the house every night?  That last trick was fit
for a conjuror.  Now she did believe that Signor Brunoni was at the
bottom of it.”

One afternoon, about five o’clock, we were startled by a hasty knock at
the door.  Miss Matty bade me run and tell Martha on no account to open
the door till she (Miss Matty) had reconnoitred through the window; and
she armed herself with a footstool to drop down on the head of the
visitor, in case he should show a face covered with black crape, as he
looked up in answer to her inquiry of who was there.  But it was nobody
but Miss Pole and Betty.  The former came upstairs, carrying a little
hand-basket, and she was evidently in a state of great agitation.

“Take care of that!” said she to me, as I offered to relieve her of her
basket.  “It’s my plate.  I am sure there is a plan to rob my house
to-night.  I am come to throw myself on your hospitality, Miss Matty.
Betty is going to sleep with her cousin at the ‘George.’  I can sit up
here all night if you will allow me; but my house is so far from any
neighbours, and I don’t believe we could be heard if we screamed ever
so!”

“But,” said Miss Matty, “what has alarmed you so much?  Have you seen any
men lurking about the house?”

“Oh, yes!” answered Miss Pole.  “Two very bad-looking men have gone three
times past the house, very slowly; and an Irish beggar-woman came not
half-an-hour ago, and all but forced herself in past Betty, saying her
children were starving, and she must speak to the mistress.  You see, she
said ‘mistress,’ though there was a hat hanging up in the hall, and it
would have been more natural to have said ‘master.’  But Betty shut the
door in her face, and came up to me, and we got the spoons together, and
sat in the parlour-window watching till we saw Thomas Jones going from
his work, when we called to him and asked him to take care of us into the
town.”

We might have triumphed over Miss Pole, who had professed such bravery
until she was frightened; but we were too glad to perceive that she
shared in the weaknesses of humanity to exult over her; and I gave up my
room to her very willingly, and shared Miss Matty’s bed for the night.
But before we retired, the two ladies rummaged up, out of the recesses of
their memory, such horrid stories of robbery and murder that I quite
quaked in my shoes.  Miss Pole was evidently anxious to prove that such
terrible events had occurred within her experience that she was justified
in her sudden panic; and Miss Matty did not like to be outdone, and
capped every story with one yet more horrible, till it reminded me oddly
enough, of an old story I had read somewhere, of a nightingale and a
musician, who strove one against the other which could produce the most
admirable music, till poor Philomel dropped down dead.

One of the stories that haunted me for a long time afterwards was of a
girl who was left in charge of a great house in Cumberland on some
particular fair-day, when the other servants all went off to the
gaieties.  The family were away in London, and a pedlar came by, and
asked to leave his large and heavy pack in the kitchen, saying he would
call for it again at night; and the girl (a gamekeeper’s daughter),
roaming about in search of amusement, chanced to hit upon a gun hanging
up in the hall, and took it down to look at the chasing; and it went off
through the open kitchen door, hit the pack, and a slow dark thread of
blood came oozing out. (How Miss Pole enjoyed this part of the story,
dwelling on each word as if she loved it!)  She rather hurried over the
further account of the girl’s bravery, and I have but a confused idea
that, somehow, she baffled the robbers with Italian irons, heated
red-hot, and then restored to blackness by being dipped in grease.

We parted for the night with an awe-stricken wonder as to what we should
hear of in the morning—and, on my part, with a vehement desire for the
night to be over and gone: I was so afraid lest the robbers should have
seen, from some dark lurking-place, that Miss Pole had carried off her
plate, and thus have a double motive for attacking our house.

                 [Picture: Asked him to take care of us]

But until Lady Glenmire came to call next day we heard of nothing
unusual.  The kitchen fire-irons were in exactly the same position
against the back door as when Martha and I had skilfully piled them up,
like spillikins, ready to fall with an awful clatter if only a cat had
touched the outside panels.  I had wondered what we should all do if thus
awakened and alarmed, and had proposed to Miss Matty that we should cover
up our faces under the bedclothes so that there should be no danger of
the robbers thinking that we could identify them; but Miss Matty, who was
trembling very much, scouted this idea, and said we owed it to society to
apprehend them, and that she should certainly do her best to lay hold of
them and lock them up in the garret till morning.

When Lady Glenmire came, we almost felt jealous of her.  Mrs Jamieson’s
house had really been attacked; at least there were men’s footsteps to be
seen on the flower borders, underneath the kitchen windows, “where nae
men should be;” and Carlo had barked all through the night as if
strangers were abroad.  Mrs Jamieson had been awakened by Lady Glenmire,
and they had rung the bell which communicated with Mr Mulliner’s room in
the third storey, and when his night-capped head had appeared over the
bannisters, in answer to the summons, they had told him of their alarm,
and the reasons for it; whereupon he retreated into his bedroom, and
locked the door (for fear of draughts, as he informed them in the
morning), and opened the window, and called out valiantly to say, if the
supposed robbers would come to him he would fight them; but, as Lady
Glenmire observed, that was but poor comfort, since they would have to
pass by Mrs Jamieson’s room and her own before they could reach him, and
must be of a very pugnacious disposition indeed if they neglected the
opportunities of robbery presented by the unguarded lower storeys, to go
up to a garret, and there force a door in order to get at the champion of
the house.  Lady Glenmire, after waiting and listening for some time in
the drawing-room, had proposed to Mrs Jamieson that they should go to
bed; but that lady said she should not feel comfortable unless she sat up
and watched; and, accordingly, she packed herself warmly up on the sofa,
where she was found by the housemaid, when she came into the room at six
o’clock, fast asleep; but Lady Glenmire went to bed, and kept awake all
night.

When Miss Pole heard of this, she nodded her head in great satisfaction.
She had been sure we should hear of something happening in Cranford that
night; and we had heard.  It was clear enough they had first proposed to
attack her house; but when they saw that she and Betty were on their
guard, and had carried off the plate, they had changed their tactics and
gone to Mrs Jamieson’s, and no one knew what might have happened if Carlo
had not barked, like a good dog as he was!

Poor Carlo! his barking days were nearly over.  Whether the gang who
infested the neighbourhood were afraid of him, or whether they were
revengeful enough, for the way in which he had baffled them on the night
in question, to poison him; or whether, as some among the more uneducated
people thought, he died of apoplexy, brought on by too much feeding and
too little exercise; at any rate, it is certain that, two days after this
eventful night, Carlo was found dead, with his poor legs stretched out
stiff in the attitude of running, as if by such unusual exertion he could
escape the sure pursuer, Death.

We were all sorry for Carlo, the old familiar friend who had snapped at
us for so many years; and the mysterious mode of his death made us very
uncomfortable.  Could Signor Brunoni be at the bottom of this?  He had
apparently killed a canary with only a word of command; his will seemed
of deadly force; who knew but what he might yet be lingering in the
neighbourhood willing all sorts of awful things!

We whispered these fancies among ourselves in the evenings; but in the
mornings our courage came back with the daylight, and in a week’s time we
had got over the shock of Carlo’s death; all but Mrs Jamieson.  She, poor
thing, felt it as she had felt no event since her husband’s death;
indeed, Miss Pole said, that as the Honourable Mr Jamieson drank a good
deal, and occasioned her much uneasiness, it was possible that Carlo’s
death might be the greater affliction.  But there was always a tinge of
cynicism in Miss Pole’s remarks.  However, one thing was clear and
certain—it was necessary for Mrs Jamieson to have some change of scene;
and Mr Mulliner was very impressive on this point, shaking his head
whenever we inquired after his mistress, and speaking of her loss of
appetite and bad nights very ominously; and with justice too, for if she
had two characteristics in her natural state of health they were a
facility of eating and sleeping.  If she could neither eat nor sleep, she
must be indeed out of spirits and out of health.

Lady Glenmire (who had evidently taken very kindly to Cranford) did not
like the idea of Mrs Jamieson’s going to Cheltenham, and more than once
insinuated pretty plainly that it was Mr Mulliner’s doing, who had been
much alarmed on the occasion of the house being attacked, and since had
said, more than once, that he felt it a very responsible charge to have
to defend so many women.  Be that as it might, Mrs Jamieson went to
Cheltenham, escorted by Mr Mulliner; and Lady Glenmire remained in
possession of the house, her ostensible office being to take care that
the maid-servants did not pick up followers.  She made a very
pleasant-looking dragon; and, as soon as it was arranged for her stay in
Cranford, she found out that Mrs Jamieson’s visit to Cheltenham was just
the best thing in the world.  She had let her house in Edinburgh, and was
for the time house-less, so the charge of her sister-in-law’s comfortable
abode was very convenient and acceptable.

Miss Pole was very much inclined to instal herself as a heroine, because
of the decided steps she had taken in flying from the two men and one
woman, whom she entitled “that murderous gang.”  She described their
appearance in glowing colours, and I noticed that every time she went
over the story some fresh trait of villainy was added to their
appearance.  One was tall—he grew to be gigantic in height before we had
done with him; he of course had black hair—and by-and-by it hung in
elf-locks over his forehead and down his back.  The other was short and
broad—and a hump sprouted out on his shoulder before we heard the last of
him; he had red hair—which deepened into carroty; and she was almost sure
he had a cast in the eye—a decided squint.  As for the woman, her eyes
glared, and she was masculine-looking—a perfect virago; most probably a
man dressed in woman’s clothes; afterwards, we heard of a beard on her
chin, and a manly voice and a stride.

If Miss Pole was delighted to recount the events of that afternoon to all
inquirers, others were not so proud of their adventures in the robbery
line.  Mr Hoggins, the surgeon, had been attacked at his own door by two
ruffians, who were concealed in the shadow of the porch, and so
effectually silenced him that he was robbed in the interval between
ringing his bell and the servant’s answering it.  Miss Pole was sure it
would turn out that this robbery had been committed by “her men,” and
went the very day she heard the report to have her teeth examined, and to
question Mr Hoggins.  She came to us afterwards; so we heard what she had
heard, straight and direct from the source, while we were yet in the
excitement and flutter of the agitation caused by the first intelligence;
for the event had only occurred the night before.

“Well!” said Miss Pole, sitting down with the decision of a person who
has made up her mind as to the nature of life and the world (and such
people never tread lightly, or seat themselves without a bump), “well,
Miss Matty! men will be men.  Every mother’s son of them wishes to be
considered Samson and Solomon rolled into one—too strong ever to be
beaten or discomfited—too wise ever to be outwitted.  If you will notice,
they have always foreseen events, though they never tell one for one’s
warning before the events happen.  My father was a man, and I know the
sex pretty well.”

She had talked herself out of breath, and we should have been very glad
to fill up the necessary pause as chorus, but we did not exactly know
what to say, or which man had suggested this diatribe against the sex; so
we only joined in generally, with a grave shake of the head, and a soft
murmur of “They are very incomprehensible, certainly!”

“Now, only think,” said she.  “There, I have undergone the risk of having
one of my remaining teeth drawn (for one is terribly at the mercy of any
surgeon-dentist; and I, for one, always speak them fair till I have got
my mouth out of their clutches), and, after all, Mr Hoggins is too much
of a man to own that he was robbed last night.”

“Not robbed!” exclaimed the chorus.

“Don’t tell me!” Miss Pole exclaimed, angry that we could be for a moment
imposed upon.  “I believe he was robbed, just as Betty told me, and he is
ashamed to own it; and, to be sure, it was very silly of him to be robbed
just at his own door; I daresay he feels that such a thing won’t raise
him in the eyes of Cranford society, and is anxious to conceal it—but he
need not have tried to impose upon me, by saying I must have heard an
exaggerated account of some petty theft of a neck of mutton, which, it
seems, was stolen out of the safe in his yard last week; he had the
impertinence to add, he believed that that was taken by the cat.  I have
no doubt, if I could get at the bottom of it, it was that Irishman
dressed up in woman’s clothes, who came spying about my house, with the
story about the starving children.”

After we had duly condemned the want of candour which Mr Hoggins had
evinced, and abused men in general, taking him for the representative and
type, we got round to the subject about which we had been talking when
Miss Pole came in; namely, how far, in the present disturbed state of the
country, we could venture to accept an invitation which Miss Matty had
just received from Mrs Forrester, to come as usual and keep the
anniversary of her wedding-day by drinking tea with her at five o’clock,
and playing a quiet pool afterwards.  Mrs Forrester had said that she
asked us with some diffidence, because the roads were, she feared, very
unsafe.  But she suggested that perhaps one of us would not object to
take the sedan, and that the others, by walking briskly, might keep up
with the long trot of the chairmen, and so we might all arrive safely at
Over Place, a suburb of the town.  (No; that is too large an expression:
a small cluster of houses separated from Cranford by about two hundred
yards of a dark and lonely lane.)  There was no doubt but that a similar
note was awaiting Miss Pole at home; so her call was a very fortunate
affair, as it enabled us to consult together.  We would all much rather
have declined this invitation; but we felt that it would not be quite
kind to Mrs Forrester, who would otherwise be left to a solitary
retrospect of her not very happy or fortunate life.  Miss Matty and Miss
Pole had been visitors on this occasion for many years, and now they
gallantly determined to nail their colours to the mast, and to go through
Darkness Lane rather than fail in loyalty to their friend.

But when the evening came, Miss Matty (for it was she who was voted into
the chair, as she had a cold), before being shut down in the sedan, like
jack-in-a-box, implored the chairmen, whatever might befall, not to run
away and leave her fastened up there, to be murdered; and even after they
had promised, I saw her tighten her features into the stern determination
of a martyr, and she gave me a melancholy and ominous shake of the head
through the glass.  However, we got there safely, only rather out of
breath, for it was who could trot hardest through Darkness Lane, and I am
afraid poor Miss Matty was sadly jolted.

Mrs Forrester had made extra preparations, in acknowledgment of our
exertion in coming to see her through such dangers.  The usual forms of
genteel ignorance as to what her servants might send up were all gone
through; and harmony and Preference seemed likely to be the order of the
evening, but for an interesting conversation that began I don’t know how,
but which had relation, of course, to the robbers who infested the
neighbourhood of Cranford.

Having braved the dangers of Darkness Lane, and thus having a little
stock of reputation for courage to fall back upon; and also, I daresay,
desirous of proving ourselves superior to men (_videlicet_ Mr Hoggins) in
the article of candour, we began to relate our individual fears, and the
private precautions we each of us took.  I owned that my pet apprehension
was eyes—eyes looking at me, and watching me, glittering out from some
dull, flat, wooden surface; and that if I dared to go up to my
looking-glass when I was panic-stricken, I should certainly turn it
round, with its back towards me, for fear of seeing eyes behind me
looking out of the darkness.  I saw Miss Matty nerving herself up for a
confession; and at last out it came.  She owned that, ever since she had
been a girl, she had dreaded being caught by her last leg, just as she
was getting into bed, by some one concealed under it.  She said, when she
was younger and more active, she used to take a flying leap from a
distance, and so bring both her legs up safely into bed at once; but that
this had always annoyed Deborah, who piqued herself upon getting into bed
gracefully, and she had given it up in consequence.  But now the old
terror would often come over her, especially since Miss Pole’s house had
been attacked (we had got quite to believe in the fact of the attack
having taken place), and yet it was very unpleasant to think of looking
under a bed, and seeing a man concealed, with a great, fierce face
staring out at you; so she had bethought herself of something—perhaps I
had noticed that she had told Martha to buy her a penny ball, such as
children play with—and now she rolled this ball under the bed every
night: if it came out on the other side, well and good; if not she always
took care to have her hand on the bell-rope, and meant to call out John
and Harry, just as if she expected men-servants to answer her ring.

We all applauded this ingenious contrivance, and Miss Matty sank back
into satisfied silence, with a look at Mrs Forrester as if to ask for
_her_ private weakness.

Mrs Forrester looked askance at Miss Pole, and tried to change the
subject a little by telling us that she had borrowed a boy from one of
the neighbouring cottages and promised his parents a hundredweight of
coals at Christmas, and his supper every evening, for the loan of him at
nights.  She had instructed him in his possible duties when he first
came; and, finding him sensible, she had given him the Major’s sword (the
Major was her late husband), and desired him to put it very carefully
behind his pillow at night, turning the edge towards the head of the
pillow.  He was a sharp lad, she was sure; for, spying out the Major’s
cocked hat, he had said, if he might have that to wear, he was sure he
could frighten two Englishmen, or four Frenchmen any day.  But she had
impressed upon him anew that he was to lose no time in putting on hats or
anything else; but, if he heard any noise, he was to run at it with his
drawn sword.  On my suggesting that some accident might occur from such
slaughterous and indiscriminate directions, and that he might rush on
Jenny getting up to wash, and have spitted her before he had discovered
that she was not a Frenchman, Mrs Forrester said she did not think that
that was likely, for he was a very sound sleeper, and generally had to be
well shaken or cold-pigged in a morning before they could rouse him.  She
sometimes thought such dead sleep must be owing to the hearty suppers the
poor lad ate, for he was half-starved at home, and she told Jenny to see
that he got a good meal at night.

          [Picture: Slaughterous and indiscriminate directions]

Still this was no confession of Mrs Forrester’s peculiar timidity, and we
urged her to tell us what she thought would frighten her more than
anything.  She paused, and stirred the fire, and snuffed the candles, and
then she said, in a sounding whisper—

“Ghosts!”

She looked at Miss Pole, as much as to say, she had declared it, and
would stand by it.  Such a look was a challenge in itself.  Miss Pole
came down upon her with indigestion, spectral illusions, optical
delusions, and a great deal out of Dr Ferrier and Dr Hibbert besides.
Miss Matty had rather a leaning to ghosts, as I have mentioned before,
and what little she did say was all on Mrs Forrester’s side, who,
emboldened by sympathy, protested that ghosts were a part of her
religion; that surely she, the widow of a major in the army, knew what to
be frightened at, and what not; in short, I never saw Mrs Forrester so
warm either before or since, for she was a gentle, meek, enduring old
lady in most things.  Not all the elder-wine that ever was mulled could
this night wash out the remembrance of this difference between Miss Pole
and her hostess.  Indeed, when the elder-wine was brought in, it gave
rise to a new burst of discussion; for Jenny, the little maiden who
staggered under the tray, had to give evidence of having seen a ghost
with her own eyes, not so many nights ago, in Darkness Lane, the very
lane we were to go through on our way home.

In spite of the uncomfortable feeling which this last consideration gave
me, I could not help being amused at Jenny’s position, which was
exceedingly like that of a witness being examined and cross-examined by
two counsel who are not at all scrupulous about asking leading questions.
The conclusion I arrived at was, that Jenny had certainly seen something
beyond what a fit of indigestion would have caused.  A lady all in white,
and without her head, was what she deposed and adhered to, supported by a
consciousness of the secret sympathy of her mistress under the withering
scorn with which Miss Pole regarded her.  And not only she, but many
others, had seen this headless lady, who sat by the roadside wringing her
hands as in deep grief.  Mrs Forrester looked at us from time to time
with an air of conscious triumph; but then she had not to pass through
Darkness Lane before she could bury herself beneath her own familiar
bed-clothes.

We preserved a discreet silence as to the headless lady while we were
putting on our things to go home, for there was no knowing how near the
ghostly head and ears might be, or what spiritual connection they might
be keeping up with the unhappy body in Darkness Lane; and, therefore,
even Miss Pole felt that it was as well not to speak lightly on such
subjects, for fear of vexing or insulting that woebegone trunk.  At
least, so I conjecture; for, instead of the busy clatter usual in the
operation, we tied on our cloaks as sadly as mutes at a funeral.  Miss
Matty drew the curtains round the windows of the chair to shut out
disagreeable sights, and the men (either because they were in spirits
that their labours were so nearly ended, or because they were going down
hill), set off at such a round and merry pace, that it was all Miss Pole
and I could do to keep up with them.  She had breath for nothing beyond
an imploring “Don’t leave me!” uttered as she clutched my arm so tightly
that I could not have quitted her, ghost or no ghost.  What a relief it
was when the men, weary of their burden and their quick trot, stopped
just where Headingley Causeway branches off from Darkness Lane!  Miss
Pole unloosed me and caught at one of the men—

“Could not you—could not you take Miss Matty round by Headingley
Causeway?—the pavement in Darkness Lane jolts so, and she is not very
strong.”

A smothered voice was heard from the inside of the chair—

“Oh! pray go on!  What is the matter?  What is the matter?  I will give
you sixpence more to go on very fast; pray don’t stop here.”

“And I’ll give you a shilling,” said Miss Pole, with tremulous dignity,
“if you’ll go by Headingley Causeway.”

The two men grunted acquiescence and took up the chair, and went along
the causeway, which certainly answered Miss Pole’s kind purpose of saving
Miss Matty’s bones; for it was covered with soft, thick mud, and even a
fall there would have been easy till the getting-up came, when there
might have been some difficulty in extrication.




CHAPTER XI—SAMUEL BROWN


THE next morning I met Lady Glenmire and Miss Pole setting out on a long
walk to find some old woman who was famous in the neighbourhood for her
skill in knitting woollen stockings.  Miss Pole said to me, with a smile
half-kindly and half-contemptuous upon her countenance, “I have been just
telling Lady Glenmire of our poor friend Mrs Forrester, and her terror of
ghosts.  It comes from living so much alone, and listening to the
bug-a-boo stories of that Jenny of hers.”  She was so calm and so much
above superstitious fears herself that I was almost ashamed to say how
glad I had been of her Headingley Causeway proposition the night before,
and turned off the conversation to something else.

In the afternoon Miss Pole called on Miss Matty to tell her of the
adventure—the real adventure they had met with on their morning’s walk.
They had been perplexed about the exact path which they were to take
across the fields in order to find the knitting old woman, and had
stopped to inquire at a little wayside public-house, standing on the high
road to London, about three miles from Cranford.  The good woman had
asked them to sit down and rest themselves while she fetched her husband,
who could direct them better than she could; and, while they were sitting
in the sanded parlour, a little girl came in.  They thought that she
belonged to the landlady, and began some trifling conversation with her;
but, on Mrs Roberts’s return, she told them that the little thing was the
only child of a couple who were staying in the house.  And then she began
a long story, out of which Lady Glenmire and Miss Pole could only gather
one or two decided facts, which were that, about six weeks ago, a light
spring-cart had broken down just before their door, in which there were
two men, one woman, and this child.  One of the men was seriously hurt—no
bones broken, only “shaken,” the landlady called it; but he had probably
sustained some severe internal injury, for he had languished in their
house ever since, attended by his wife, the mother of this little girl.
Miss Pole had asked what he was, what he looked like.  And Mrs Roberts
had made answer that he was not like a gentleman, nor yet like a common
person; if it had not been that he and his wife were such decent, quiet
people, she could almost have thought he was a mountebank, or something
of that kind, for they had a great box in the cart, full of she did not
know what.  She had helped to unpack it, and take out their linen and
clothes, when the other man—his twin-brother, she believed he was—had
gone off with the horse and cart.

Miss Pole had begun to have her suspicions at this point, and expressed
her idea that it was rather strange that the box and cart and horse and
all should have disappeared; but good Mrs Roberts seemed to have become
quite indignant at Miss Pole’s implied suggestion; in fact, Miss Pole
said she was as angry as if Miss Pole had told her that she herself was a
swindler.  As the best way of convincing the ladies, she bethought her of
begging them to see the wife; and, as Miss Pole said, there was no
doubting the honest, worn, bronzed face of the woman, who at the first
tender word from Lady Glenmire, burst into tears, which she was too weak
to check until some word from the landlady made her swallow down her
sobs, in order that she might testify to the Christian kindness shown by
Mr and Mrs Roberts.  Miss Pole came round with a swing to as vehement a
belief in the sorrowful tale as she had been sceptical before; and, as a
proof of this, her energy in the poor sufferer’s behalf was nothing
daunted when she found out that he, and no other, was our Signor Brunoni,
to whom all Cranford had been attributing all manner of evil this six
weeks past!  Yes! his wife said his proper name was Samuel Brown—“Sam,”
she called him—but to the last we preferred calling him “the Signor”; it
sounded so much better.

The end of their conversation with the Signora Brunoni was that it was
agreed that he should be placed under medical advice, and for any expense
incurred in procuring this Lady Glenmire promised to hold herself
responsible, and had accordingly gone to Mr Hoggins to beg him to ride
over to the “Rising Sun” that very afternoon, and examine into the
signor’s real state; and, as Miss Pole said, if it was desirable to
remove him to Cranford to be more immediately under Mr Hoggins’s eye, she
would undertake to see for lodgings and arrange about the rent.  Mrs
Roberts had been as kind as could be all throughout, but it was evident
that their long residence there had been a slight inconvenience.

Before Miss Pole left us, Miss Matty and I were as full of the morning’s
adventure as she was.  We talked about it all the evening, turning it in
every possible light, and we went to bed anxious for the morning, when we
should surely hear from someone what Mr Hoggins thought and recommended;
for, as Miss Matty observed, though Mr Hoggins did say “Jack’s up,” “a
fig for his heels,” and called Preference “Pref.” she believed he was a
very worthy man and a very clever surgeon.  Indeed, we were rather proud
of our doctor at Cranford, as a doctor.  We often wished, when we heard
of Queen Adelaide or the Duke of Wellington being ill, that they would
send for Mr Hoggins; but, on consideration, we were rather glad they did
not, for, if we were ailing, what should we do if Mr Hoggins had been
appointed physician-in-ordinary to the Royal Family?  As a surgeon we
were proud of him; but as a man—or rather, I should say, as a
gentleman—we could only shake our heads over his name and himself, and
wished that he had read Lord Chesterfield’s Letters in the days when his
manners were susceptible of improvement.  Nevertheless, we all regarded
his dictum in the signor’s case as infallible, and when he said that with
care and attention he might rally, we had no more fear for him.

But, although we had no more fear, everybody did as much as if there was
great cause for anxiety—as indeed there was until Mr Hoggins took charge
of him.  Miss Pole looked out clean and comfortable, if homely, lodgings;
Miss Matty sent the sedan-chair for him, and Martha and I aired it well
before it left Cranford by holding a warming-pan full of red-hot coals in
it, and then shutting it up close, smoke and all, until the time when he
should get into it at the “Rising Sun.”  Lady Glenmire undertook the
medical department under Mr Hoggins’s directions, and rummaged up all Mrs
Jamieson’s medicine glasses, and spoons, and bed-tables, in a
free-and-easy way, that made Miss Matty feel a little anxious as to what
that lady and Mr Mulliner might say, if they knew.  Mrs Forrester made
some of the bread-jelly, for which she was so famous, to have ready as a
refreshment in the lodgings when he should arrive.  A present of this
bread-jelly was the highest mark of favour dear Mrs Forrester could
confer.  Miss Pole had once asked her for the receipt, but she had met
with a very decided rebuff; that lady told her that she could not part
with it to any one during her life, and that after her death it was
bequeathed, as her executors would find, to Miss Matty.  What Miss Matty,
or, as Mrs Forrester called her (remembering the clause in her will and
the dignity of the occasion), Miss Matilda Jenkyns—might choose to do
with the receipt when it came into her possession—whether to make it
public, or to hand it down as an heirloom—she did not know, nor would she
dictate.  And a mould of this admirable, digestible, unique bread-jelly
was sent by Mrs Forrester to our poor sick conjuror.  Who says that the
aristocracy are proud?  Here was a lady by birth a Tyrrell, and descended
from the great Sir Walter that shot King Rufus, and in whose veins ran
the blood of him who murdered the little princes in the Tower, going
every day to see what dainty dishes she could prepare for Samuel Brown, a
mountebank!  But, indeed, it was wonderful to see what kind feelings were
called out by this poor man’s coming amongst us.  And also wonderful to
see how the great Cranford panic, which had been occasioned by his first
coming in his Turkish dress, melted away into thin air on his second
coming—pale and feeble, and with his heavy, filmy eyes, that only
brightened a very little when they fell upon the countenance of his
faithful wife, or their pale and sorrowful little girl.

Somehow we all forgot to be afraid.  I daresay it was that finding out
that he, who had first excited our love of the marvellous by his
unprecedented arts, had not sufficient every-day gifts to manage a shying
horse, made us feel as if we were ourselves again.  Miss Pole came with
her little basket at all hours of the evening, as if her lonely house and
the unfrequented road to it had never been infested by that “murderous
gang”; Mrs Forrester said she thought that neither Jenny nor she need
mind the headless lady who wept and wailed in Darkness Lane, for surely
the power was never given to such beings to harm those who went about to
try to do what little good was in their power, to which Jenny tremblingly
assented; but the mistress’s theory had little effect on the maid’s
practice until she had sewn two pieces of red flannel in the shape of a
cross on her inner garment.

I found Miss Matty covering her penny ball—the ball that she used to roll
under her bed—with gay-coloured worsted in rainbow stripes.

“My dear,” said she, “my heart is sad for that little careworn child.
Although her father is a conjuror, she looks as if she had never had a
good game of play in her life.  I used to make very pretty balls in this
way when I was a girl, and I thought I would try if I could not make this
one smart and take it to Phoebe this afternoon.  I think ‘the gang’ must
have left the neighbourhood, for one does not hear any more of their
violence and robbery now.”

We were all of us far too full of the signor’s precarious state to talk
either about robbers or ghosts.  Indeed, Lady Glenmire said she never had
heard of any actual robberies, except that two little boys had stolen
some apples from Farmer Benson’s orchard, and that some eggs had been
missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward’s stall.  But that was expecting
too much of us; we could not acknowledge that we had only had this small
foundation for all our panic.  Miss Pole drew herself up at this remark
of Lady Glenmire’s, and said “that she wished she could agree with her as
to the very small reason we had had for alarm, but with the recollection
of a man disguised as a woman who had endeavoured to force himself into
her house while his confederates waited outside; with the knowledge
gained from Lady Glenmire herself, of the footprints seen on Mrs
Jamieson’s flower borders; with the fact before her of the audacious
robbery committed on Mr Hoggins at his own door”—But here Lady Glenmire
broke in with a very strong expression of doubt as to whether this last
story was not an entire fabrication founded upon the theft of a cat; she
grew so red while she was saying all this that I was not surprised at
Miss Pole’s manner of bridling up, and I am certain, if Lady Glenmire had
not been “her ladyship,” we should have had a more emphatic contradiction
than the “Well, to be sure!” and similar fragmentary ejaculations, which
were all that she ventured upon in my lady’s presence.  But when she was
gone Miss Pole began a long congratulation to Miss Matty that so far they
had escaped marriage, which she noticed always made people credulous to
the last degree; indeed, she thought it argued great natural credulity in
a woman if she could not keep herself from being married; and in what
Lady Glenmire had said about Mr Hoggins’s robbery we had a specimen of
what people came to if they gave way to such a weakness; evidently Lady
Glenmire would swallow anything if she could believe the poor vamped-up
story about a neck of mutton and a pussy with which he had tried to
impose on Miss Pole, only she had always been on her guard against
believing too much of what men said.

We were thankful, as Miss Pole desired us to be, that we had never been
married; but I think, of the two, we were even more thankful that the
robbers had left Cranford; at least I judge so from a speech of Miss
Matty’s that evening, as we sat over the fire, in which she evidently
looked upon a husband as a great protector against thieves, burglars, and
ghosts; and said that she did not think that she should dare to be always
warning young people against matrimony, as Miss Pole did continually; to
be sure, marriage was a risk, as she saw, now she had had some
experience; but she remembered the time when she had looked forward to
being married as much as any one.

“Not to any particular person, my dear,” said she, hastily checking
herself up, as if she were afraid of having admitted too much; “only the
old story, you know, of ladies always saying, ‘_When_ I marry,’ and
gentlemen, ‘_If_ I marry.’”  It was a joke spoken in rather a sad tone,
and I doubt if either of us smiled; but I could not see Miss Matty’s face
by the flickering fire-light.  In a little while she continued—

“But, after all, I have not told you the truth.  It is so long ago, and
no one ever knew how much I thought of it at the time, unless, indeed, my
dear mother guessed; but I may say that there was a time when I did not
think I should have been only Miss Matty Jenkyns all my life; for even if
I did meet with any one who wished to marry me now (and, as Miss Pole
says, one is never too safe), I could not take him—I hope he would not
take it too much to heart, but I could _not_ take him—or any one but the
person I once thought I should be married to; and he is dead and gone,
and he never knew how it all came about that I said ‘No,’ when I had
thought many and many a time—Well, it’s no matter what I thought.  God
ordains it all, and I am very happy, my dear.  No one has such kind
friends as I,” continued she, taking my hand and holding it in hers.

If I had never known of Mr Holbrook, I could have said something in this
pause, but as I had, I could not think of anything that would come in
naturally, and so we both kept silence for a little time.

“My father once made us,” she began, “keep a diary, in two columns; on
one side we were to put down in the morning what we thought would be the
course and events of the coming day, and at night we were to put down on
the other side what really had happened.  It would be to some people
rather a sad way of telling their lives,” (a tear dropped upon my hand at
these words)—“I don’t mean that mine has been sad, only so very different
to what I expected.  I remember, one winter’s evening, sitting over our
bedroom fire with Deborah—I remember it as if it were yesterday—and we
were planning our future lives, both of us were planning, though only she
talked about it.  She said she should like to marry an archdeacon, and
write his charges; and you know, my dear, she never was married, and, for
aught I know, she never spoke to an unmarried archdeacon in her life.  I
never was ambitious, nor could I have written charges, but I thought I
could manage a house (my mother used to call me her right hand), and I
was always so fond of little children—the shyest babies would stretch out
their little arms to come to me; when I was a girl, I was half my leisure
time nursing in the neighbouring cottages; but I don’t know how it was,
when I grew sad and grave—which I did a year or two after this time—the
little things drew back from me, and I am afraid I lost the knack, though
I am just as fond of children as ever, and have a strange yearning at my
heart whenever I see a mother with her baby in her arms.  Nay, my dear”
(and by a sudden blaze which sprang up from a fall of the unstirred
coals, I saw that her eyes were full of tears—gazing intently on some
vision of what might have been), “do you know I dream sometimes that I
have a little child—always the same—a little girl of about two years old;
she never grows older, though I have dreamt about her for many years.  I
don’t think I ever dream of any words or sound she makes; she is very
noiseless and still, but she comes to me when she is very sorry or very
glad, and I have wakened with the clasp of her dear little arms round my
neck.  Only last night—perhaps because I had gone to sleep thinking of
this ball for Phoebe—my little darling came in my dream, and put up her
mouth to be kissed, just as I have seen real babies do to real mothers
before going to bed.  But all this is nonsense, dear! only don’t be
frightened by Miss Pole from being married.  I can fancy it may be a very
happy state, and a little credulity helps one on through life very
smoothly—better than always doubting and doubting and seeing difficulties
and disagreeables in everything.”

              [Picture: Would stretch out their little arms]

If I had been inclined to be daunted from matrimony, it would not have
been Miss Pole to do it; it would have been the lot of poor Signor
Brunoni and his wife.  And yet again, it was an encouragement to see how,
through all their cares and sorrows, they thought of each other and not
of themselves; and how keen were their joys, if they only passed through
each other, or through the little Phoebe.

The signora told me, one day, a good deal about their lives up to this
period.  It began by my asking her whether Miss Pole’s story of the
twin-brothers were true; it sounded so wonderful a likeness, that I
should have had my doubts, if Miss Pole had not been unmarried.  But the
signora, or (as we found out she preferred to be called) Mrs Brown, said
it was quite true; that her brother-in-law was by many taken for her
husband, which was of great assistance to them in their profession;
“though,” she continued, “how people can mistake Thomas for the real
Signor Brunoni, I can’t conceive; but he says they do; so I suppose I
must believe him.  Not but what he is a very good man; I am sure I don’t
know how we should have paid our bill at the ‘Rising Sun’ but for the
money he sends; but people must know very little about art if they can
take him for my husband.  Why, Miss, in the ball trick, where my husband
spreads his fingers wide, and throws out his little finger with quite an
air and a grace, Thomas just clumps up his hand like a fist, and might
have ever so many balls hidden in it.  Besides, he has never been in
India, and knows nothing of the proper sit of a turban.”

“Have you been in India?” said I, rather astonished.

“Oh, yes! many a year, ma’am.  Sam was a sergeant in the 31st; and when
the regiment was ordered to India, I drew a lot to go, and I was more
thankful than I can tell; for it seemed as if it would only be a slow
death to me to part from my husband.  But, indeed, ma’am, if I had known
all, I don’t know whether I would not rather have died there and then
than gone through what I have done since.  To be sure, I’ve been able to
comfort Sam, and to be with him; but, ma’am, I’ve lost six children,”
said she, looking up at me with those strange eyes that I’ve never
noticed but in mothers of dead children—with a kind of wild look in them,
as if seeking for what they never more might find.  “Yes!  Six children
died off, like little buds nipped untimely, in that cruel India.  I
thought, as each died, I never could—I never would—love a child again;
and when the next came, it had not only its own love, but the deeper love
that came from the thoughts of its little dead brothers and sisters.  And
when Phoebe was coming, I said to my husband, ‘Sam, when the child is
born, and I am strong, I shall leave you; it will cut my heart cruel; but
if this baby dies too, I shall go mad; the madness is in me now; but if
you let me go down to Calcutta, carrying my baby step by step, it will,
maybe, work itself off; and I will save, and I will hoard, and I will
beg—and I will die, to get a passage home to England, where our baby may
live?’  God bless him! he said I might go; and he saved up his pay, and I
saved every pice I could get for washing or any way; and when Phoebe
came, and I grew strong again, I set off.  It was very lonely; through
the thick forests, dark again with their heavy trees—along by the river’s
side (but I had been brought up near the Avon in Warwickshire, so that
flowing noise sounded like home)—from station to station, from Indian
village to village, I went along, carrying my child.  I had seen one of
the officer’s ladies with a little picture, ma’am—done by a Catholic
foreigner, ma’am—of the Virgin and the little Saviour, ma’am.  She had
him on her arm, and her form was softly curled round him, and their
cheeks touched.  Well, when I went to bid good-bye to this lady, for whom
I had washed, she cried sadly; for she, too, had lost her children, but
she had not another to save, like me; and I was bold enough to ask her
would she give me that print.  And she cried the more, and said her
children were with that little blessed Jesus; and gave it me, and told me
that she had heard it had been painted on the bottom of a cask, which
made it have that round shape.  And when my body was very weary, and my
heart was sick (for there were times when I misdoubted if I could ever
reach my home, and there were times when I thought of my husband, and one
time when I thought my baby was dying), I took out that picture and
looked at it, till I could have thought the mother spoke to me, and
comforted me.  And the natives were very kind.  We could not understand
one another; but they saw my baby on my breast, and they came out to me,
and brought me rice and milk, and sometimes flowers—I have got some of
the flowers dried.  Then, the next morning, I was so tired; and they
wanted me to stay with them—I could tell that—and tried to frighten me
from going into the deep woods, which, indeed, looked very strange and
dark; but it seemed to me as if Death was following me to take my baby
away from me; and as if I must go on, and on—and I thought how God had
cared for mothers ever since the world was made, and would care for me;
so I bade them good-bye, and set off afresh.  And once when my baby was
ill, and both she and I needed rest, He led me to a place where I found a
kind Englishman lived, right in the midst of the natives.”

“And you reached Calcutta safely at last?”

“Yes, safely!  Oh! when I knew I had only two days’ journey more before
me, I could not help it, ma’am—it might be idolatry, I cannot tell—but I
was near one of the native temples, and I went into it with my baby to
thank God for His great mercy; for it seemed to me that where others had
prayed before to their God, in their joy or in their agony, was of itself
a sacred place.  And I got as servant to an invalid lady, who grew quite
fond of my baby aboard-ship; and, in two years’ time, Sam earned his
discharge, and came home to me, and to our child.  Then he had to fix on
a trade; but he knew of none; and once, once upon a time, he had learnt
some tricks from an Indian juggler; so he set up conjuring, and it
answered so well that he took Thomas to help him—as his man, you know,
not as another conjuror, though Thomas has set it up now on his own hook.
But it has been a great help to us that likeness between the twins, and
made a good many tricks go off well that they made up together.  And
Thomas is a good brother, only he has not the fine carriage of my
husband, so that I can’t think how he can be taken for Signor Brunoni
himself, as he says he is.”

“Poor little Phoebe!” said I, my thoughts going back to the baby she
carried all those hundred miles.

“Ah! you may say so!  I never thought I should have reared her, though,
when she fell ill at Chunderabaddad; but that good, kind Aga Jenkyns took
us in, which I believe was the very saving of her.”

“Jenkyns!” said I.

“Yes, Jenkyns.  I shall think all people of that name are kind; for here
is that nice old lady who comes every day to take Phoebe a walk!”

But an idea had flashed through my head; could the Aga Jenkyns be the
lost Peter?  True he was reported by many to be dead.  But, equally true,
some had said that he had arrived at the dignity of Great Lama of Thibet.
Miss Matty thought he was alive.  I would make further inquiry.




CHAPTER XII—ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED


WAS the “poor Peter” of Cranford the Aga Jenkyns of Chunderabaddad, or
was he not?  As somebody says, that was the question.

In my own home, whenever people had nothing else to do, they blamed me
for want of discretion.  Indiscretion was my bug-bear fault.  Everybody
has a bug-bear fault, a sort of standing characteristic—a _pièce de
résistance_ for their friends to cut at; and in general they cut and come
again.  I was tired of being called indiscreet and incautious; and I
determined for once to prove myself a model of prudence and wisdom.  I
would not even hint my suspicions respecting the Aga.  I would collect
evidence and carry it home to lay before my father, as the family friend
of the two Miss Jenkynses.

In my search after facts, I was often reminded of a description my father
had once given of a ladies’ committee that he had had to preside over.
He said he could not help thinking of a passage in Dickens, which spoke
of a chorus in which every man took the tune he knew best, and sang it to
his own satisfaction.  So, at this charitable committee, every lady took
the subject uppermost in her mind, and talked about it to her own great
contentment, but not much to the advancement of the subject they had met
to discuss.  But even that committee could have been nothing to the
Cranford ladies when I attempted to gain some clear and definite
information as to poor Peter’s height, appearance, and when and where he
was seen and heard of last.  For instance, I remember asking Miss Pole
(and I thought the question was very opportune, for I put it when I met
her at a call at Mrs Forrester’s, and both the ladies had known Peter,
and I imagined that they might refresh each other’s memories)—I asked
Miss Pole what was the very last thing they had ever heard about him; and
then she named the absurd report to which I have alluded, about his
having been elected Great Lama of Thibet; and this was a signal for each
lady to go off on her separate idea.  Mrs Forrester’s start was made on
the veiled prophet in Lalla Rookh—whether I thought he was meant for the
Great Lama, though Peter was not so ugly, indeed rather handsome, if he
had not been freckled.  I was thankful to see her double upon Peter; but,
in a moment, the delusive lady was off upon Rowland’s Kalydor, and the
merits of cosmetics and hair oils in general, and holding forth so
fluently that I turned to listen to Miss Pole, who (through the llamas,
the beasts of burden) had got to Peruvian bonds, and the share market,
and her poor opinion of joint-stock banks in general, and of that one in
particular in which Miss Matty’s money was invested.  In vain I put in
“When was it—in what year was it that you heard that Mr Peter was the
Great Lama?”  They only joined issue to dispute whether llamas were
carnivorous animals or not; in which dispute they were not quite on fair
grounds, as Mrs Forrester (after they had grown warm and cool again)
acknowledged that she always confused carnivorous and graminivorous
together, just as she did horizontal and perpendicular; but then she
apologised for it very prettily, by saying that in her day the only use
people made of four-syllabled words was to teach how they should be
spelt.

The only fact I gained from this conversation was that certainly Peter
had last been heard of in India, “or that neighbourhood”; and that this
scanty intelligence of his whereabouts had reached Cranford in the year
when Miss Pole had brought her Indian muslin gown, long since worn out
(we washed it and mended it, and traced its decline and fall into a
window-blind before we could go on); and in a year when Wombwell came to
Cranford, because Miss Matty had wanted to see an elephant in order that
she might the better imagine Peter riding on one; and had seen a
boa-constrictor too, which was more than she wished to imagine in her
fancy-pictures of Peter’s locality; and in a year when Miss Jenkyns had
learnt some piece of poetry off by heart, and used to say, at all the
Cranford parties, how Peter was “surveying mankind from China to Peru,”
which everybody had thought very grand, and rather appropriate, because
India was between China and Peru, if you took care to turn the globe to
the left instead of the right.

I suppose all these inquiries of mine, and the consequent curiosity
excited in the minds of my friends, made us blind and deaf to what was
going on around us.  It seemed to me as if the sun rose and shone, and as
if the rain rained on Cranford, just as usual, and I did not notice any
sign of the times that could be considered as a prognostic of any
uncommon event; and, to the best of my belief, not only Miss Matty and
Mrs Forrester, but even Miss Pole herself, whom we looked upon as a kind
of prophetess, from the knack she had of foreseeing things before they
came to pass—although she did not like to disturb her friends by telling
them her foreknowledge—even Miss Pole herself was breathless with
astonishment when she came to tell us of the astounding piece of news.
But I must recover myself; the contemplation of it, even at this distance
of time, has taken away my breath and my grammar, and unless I subdue my
emotion, my spelling will go too.

We were sitting—Miss Matty and I—much as usual, she in the blue chintz
easy-chair, with her back to the light, and her knitting in her hand, I
reading aloud the _St James’s Chronicle_.  A few minutes more, and we
should have gone to make the little alterations in dress usual before
calling-time (twelve o’clock) in Cranford.  I remember the scene and the
date well.  We had been talking of the signor’s rapid recovery since the
warmer weather had set in, and praising Mr Hoggins’s skill, and lamenting
his want of refinement and manner (it seems a curious coincidence that
this should have been our subject, but so it was), when a knock was
heard—a caller’s knock—three distinct taps—and we were flying (that is to
say, Miss Matty could not walk very fast, having had a touch of
rheumatism) to our rooms, to change cap and collars, when Miss Pole
arrested us by calling out, as she came up the stairs, “Don’t go—I can’t
wait—it is not twelve, I know—but never mind your dress—I must speak to
you.”  We did our best to look as if it was not we who had made the
hurried movement, the sound of which she had heard; for, of course, we
did not like to have it supposed that we had any old clothes that it was
convenient to wear out in the “sanctuary of home,” as Miss Jenkyns once
prettily called the back parlour, where she was tying up preserves.  So
we threw our gentility with double force into our manners, and very
genteel we were for two minutes while Miss Pole recovered breath, and
excited our curiosity strongly by lifting up her hands in amazement, and
bringing them down in silence, as if what she had to say was too big for
words, and could only be expressed by pantomime.

“What do you think, Miss Matty?  What _do_ you think?  Lady Glenmire is
to marry—is to be married, I mean—Lady Glenmire—Mr Hoggins—Mr Hoggins is
going to marry Lady Glenmire!”

“Marry!” said we.  “Marry!  Madness!”

                 [Picture: What do you think, Miss Matty]

“Marry!” said Miss Pole, with the decision that belonged to her
character.  “_I_ said marry! as you do; and I also said, ‘What a fool my
lady is going to make of herself!’  I could have said ‘Madness!’ but I
controlled myself, for it was in a public shop that I heard of it.  Where
feminine delicacy is gone to, I don’t know!  You and I, Miss Matty, would
have been ashamed to have known that our marriage was spoken of in a
grocer’s shop, in the hearing of shopmen!”

“But,” said Miss Matty, sighing as one recovering from a blow, “perhaps
it is not true.  Perhaps we are doing her injustice.”

“No,” said Miss Pole.  “I have taken care to ascertain that.  I went
straight to Mrs Fitz-Adam, to borrow a cookery-book which I knew she had;
and I introduced my congratulations _à propos_ of the difficulty
gentlemen must have in house-keeping; and Mrs Fitz-Adam bridled up, and
said that she believed it was true, though how and where I could have
heard it she did not know.  She said her brother and Lady Glenmire had
come to an understanding at last.  ‘Understanding!’ such a coarse word!
But my lady will have to come down to many a want of refinement.  I have
reason to believe Mr Hoggins sups on bread-and-cheese and beer every
night.

“Marry!” said Miss Matty once again.  “Well!  I never thought of it.  Two
people that we know going to be married.  It’s coming very near!”

“So near that my heart stopped beating when I heard of it, while you
might have counted twelve,” said Miss Pole.

“One does not know whose turn may come next.  Here, in Cranford, poor
Lady Glenmire might have thought herself safe,” said Miss Matty, with a
gentle pity in her tones.

“Bah!” said Miss Pole, with a toss of her head.  “Don’t you remember poor
dear Captain Brown’s song ‘Tibbie Fowler,’ and the line—

    ‘Set her on the Tintock tap,
    The wind will blaw a man till her.’”

“That was because ‘Tibbie Fowler’ was rich, I think.”

“Well! there was a kind of attraction about Lady Glenmire that I, for
one, should be ashamed to have.”

I put in my wonder.  “But how can she have fancied Mr Hoggins?  I am not
surprised that Mr Hoggins has liked her.”

“Oh!  I don’t know.  Mr Hoggins is rich, and very pleasant-looking,” said
Miss Matty, “and very good-tempered and kind-hearted.”

“She has married for an establishment, that’s it.  I suppose she takes
the surgery with it,” said Miss Pole, with a little dry laugh at her own
joke.  But, like many people who think they have made a severe and
sarcastic speech, which yet is clever of its kind, she began to relax in
her grimness from the moment when she made this allusion to the surgery;
and we turned to speculate on the way in which Mrs Jamieson would receive
the news.  The person whom she had left in charge of her house to keep
off followers from her maids to set up a follower of her own!  And that
follower a man whom Mrs Jamieson had tabooed as vulgar, and inadmissible
to Cranford society, not merely on account of his name, but because of
his voice, his complexion, his boots, smelling of the stable, and
himself, smelling of drugs.  Had he ever been to see Lady Glenmire at Mrs
Jamieson’s?  Chloride of lime would not purify the house in its owner’s
estimation if he had.  Or had their interviews been confined to the
occasional meetings in the chamber of the poor sick conjuror, to whom,
with all our sense of the _mésalliance_, we could not help allowing that
they had both been exceedingly kind?  And now it turned out that a
servant of Mrs Jamieson’s had been ill, and Mr Hoggins had been attending
her for some weeks.  So the wolf had got into the fold, and now he was
carrying off the shepherdess.  What would Mrs Jamieson say?  We looked
into the darkness of futurity as a child gazes after a rocket up in the
cloudy sky, full of wondering expectation of the rattle, the discharge,
and the brilliant shower of sparks and light.  Then we brought ourselves
down to earth and the present time by questioning each other (being all
equally ignorant, and all equally without the slightest data to build any
conclusions upon) as to when IT would take place?  Where?  How much a
year Mr Hoggins had?  Whether she would drop her title?  And how Martha
and the other correct servants in Cranford would ever be brought to
announce a married couple as Lady Glenmire and Mr Hoggins?  But would
they be visited?  Would Mrs Jamieson let us?  Or must we choose between
the Honourable Mrs Jamieson and the degraded Lady Glenmire?  We all liked
Lady Glenmire the best.  She was bright, and kind, and sociable, and
agreeable; and Mrs Jamieson was dull, and inert, and pompous, and
tiresome.  But we had acknowledged the sway of the latter so long, that
it seemed like a kind of disloyalty now even to meditate disobedience to
the prohibition we anticipated.

Mrs Forrester surprised us in our darned caps and patched collars; and we
forgot all about them in our eagerness to see how she would bear the
information, which we honourably left to Miss Pole, to impart, although,
if we had been inclined to take unfair advantage, we might have rushed in
ourselves, for she had a most out-of-place fit of coughing for five
minutes after Mrs Forrester entered the room.  I shall never forget the
imploring expression of her eyes, as she looked at us over her
pocket-handkerchief.  They said, as plain as words could speak, “Don’t
let Nature deprive me of the treasure which is mine, although for a time
I can make no use of it.”  And we did not.

Mrs Forrester’s surprise was equal to ours; and her sense of injury
rather greater, because she had to feel for her Order, and saw more fully
than we could do how such conduct brought stains on the aristocracy.

When she and Miss Pole left us we endeavoured to subside into calmness;
but Miss Matty was really upset by the intelligence she had heard.  She
reckoned it up, and it was more than fifteen years since she had heard of
any of her acquaintance going to be married, with the one exception of
Miss Jessie Brown; and, as she said, it gave her quite a shock, and made
her feel as if she could not think what would happen next.

I don’t know whether it is a fancy of mine, or a real fact, but I have
noticed that, just after the announcement of an engagement in any set,
the unmarried ladies in that set flutter out in an unusual gaiety and
newness of dress, as much as to say, in a tacit and unconscious manner,
“We also are spinsters.”  Miss Matty and Miss Pole talked and thought
more about bonnets, gowns, caps, and shawls, during the fortnight that
succeeded this call, than I had known them do for years before.  But it
might be the spring weather, for it was a warm and pleasant March; and
merinoes and beavers, and woollen materials of all sorts were but
ungracious receptacles of the bright sun’s glancing rays.  It had not
been Lady Glenmire’s dress that had won Mr Hoggins’s heart, for she went
about on her errands of kindness more shabby than ever.  Although in the
hurried glimpses I caught of her at church or elsewhere she appeared
rather to shun meeting any of her friends, her face seemed to have almost
something of the flush of youth in it; her lips looked redder and more
trembling full than in their old compressed state, and her eyes dwelt on
all things with a lingering light, as if she was learning to love
Cranford and its belongings.  Mr Hoggins looked broad and radiant, and
creaked up the middle aisle at church in a brand-new pair of top-boots—an
audible, as well as visible, sign of his purposed change of state; for
the tradition went, that the boots he had worn till now were the
identical pair in which he first set out on his rounds in Cranford
twenty-five years ago; only they had been new-pieced, high and low, top
and bottom, heel and sole, black leather and brown leather, more times
than any one could tell.

None of the ladies in Cranford chose to sanction the marriage by
congratulating either of the parties.  We wished to ignore the whole
affair until our liege lady, Mrs Jamieson, returned.  Till she came back
to give us our cue, we felt that it would be better to consider the
engagement in the same light as the Queen of Spain’s legs—facts which
certainly existed, but the less said about the better.  This restraint
upon our tongues—for you see if we did not speak about it to any of the
parties concerned, how could we get answers to the questions that we
longed to ask?—was beginning to be irksome, and our idea of the dignity
of silence was paling before our curiosity, when another direction was
given to our thoughts, by an announcement on the part of the principal
shopkeeper of Cranford, who ranged the trades from grocer and
cheesemonger to man-milliner, as occasion required, that the spring
fashions were arrived, and would be exhibited on the following Tuesday at
his rooms in High Street.  Now Miss Matty had been only waiting for this
before buying herself a new silk gown.  I had offered, it is true, to
send to Drumble for patterns, but she had rejected my proposal, gently
implying that she had not forgotten her disappointment about the
sea-green turban.  I was thankful that I was on the spot now, to
counteract the dazzling fascination of any yellow or scarlet silk.

I must say a word or two here about myself.  I have spoken of my father’s
old friendship for the Jenkyns family; indeed, I am not sure if there was
not some distant relationship.  He had willingly allowed me to remain all
the winter at Cranford, in consideration of a letter which Miss Matty had
written to him about the time of the panic, in which I suspect she had
exaggerated my powers and my bravery as a defender of the house.  But now
that the days were longer and more cheerful, he was beginning to urge the
necessity of my return; and I only delayed in a sort of odd forlorn hope
that if I could obtain any clear information, I might make the account
given by the signora of the Aga Jenkyns tally with that of “poor Peter,”
his appearance and disappearance, which I had winnowed out of the
conversation of Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester.




CHAPTER XIII—STOPPED PAYMENT


THE very Tuesday morning on which Mr Johnson was going to show the
fashions, the post-woman brought two letters to the house.  I say the
post-woman, but I should say the postman’s wife.  He was a lame
shoemaker, a very clean, honest man, much respected in the town; but he
never brought the letters round except on unusual occasions, such as
Christmas Day or Good Friday; and on those days the letters, which should
have been delivered at eight in the morning, did not make their
appearance until two or three in the afternoon, for every one liked poor
Thomas, and gave him a welcome on these festive occasions.  He used to
say, “He was welly stawed wi’ eating, for there were three or four houses
where nowt would serve ’em but he must share in their breakfast;” and by
the time he had done his last breakfast, he came to some other friend who
was beginning dinner; but come what might in the way of temptation, Tom
was always sober, civil, and smiling; and, as Miss Jenkyns used to say,
it was a lesson in patience, that she doubted not would call out that
precious quality in some minds, where, but for Thomas, it might have lain
dormant and undiscovered.  Patience was certainly very dormant in Miss
Jenkyns’s mind.  She was always expecting letters, and always drumming on
the table till the post-woman had called or gone past.  On Christmas Day
and Good Friday she drummed from breakfast till church, from church-time
till two o’clock—unless when the fire wanted stirring, when she
invariably knocked down the fire-irons, and scolded Miss Matty for it.
But equally certain was the hearty welcome and the good dinner for
Thomas; Miss Jenkyns standing over him like a bold dragoon, questioning
him as to his children—what they were doing—what school they went to;
upbraiding him if another was likely to make its appearance, but sending
even the little babies the shilling and the mince-pie which was her gift
to all the children, with half-a-crown in addition for both father and
mother.  The post was not half of so much consequence to dear Miss Matty;
but not for the world would she have diminished Thomas’s welcome and his
dole, though I could see that she felt rather shy over the ceremony,
which had been regarded by Miss Jenkyns as a glorious opportunity for
giving advice and benefiting her fellow-creatures.  Miss Matty would
steal the money all in a lump into his hand, as if she were ashamed of
herself.  Miss Jenkyns gave him each individual coin separate, with a
“There! that’s for yourself; that’s for Jenny,” etc.  Miss Matty would
even beckon Martha out of the kitchen while he ate his food: and once, to
my knowledge, winked at its rapid disappearance into a blue cotton
pocket-handkerchief.  Miss Jenkyns almost scolded him if he did not leave
a clean plate, however heaped it might have been, and gave an injunction
with every mouthful.

             [Picture: Standing over him like a bold dragoon]

I have wandered a long way from the two letters that awaited us on the
breakfast-table that Tuesday morning.  Mine was from my father.  Miss
Matty’s was printed.  My father’s was just a man’s letter; I mean it was
very dull, and gave no information beyond that he was well, that they had
had a good deal of rain, that trade was very stagnant, and there were
many disagreeable rumours afloat.  He then asked me if I knew whether
Miss Matty still retained her shares in the Town and County Bank, as
there were very unpleasant reports about it; though nothing more than he
had always foreseen, and had prophesied to Miss Jenkyns years ago, when
she would invest their little property in it—the only unwise step that
clever woman had ever taken, to his knowledge (the only time she ever
acted against his advice, I knew).  However, if anything had gone wrong,
of course I was not to think of leaving Miss Matty while I could be of
any use, etc.

“Who is your letter from, my dear?  Mine is a very civil invitation,
signed ‘Edwin Wilson,’ asking me to attend an important meeting of the
shareholders of the Town and County Bank, to be held in Drumble, on
Thursday the twenty-first.  I am sure, it is very attentive of them to
remember me.”

I did not like to hear of this “important meeting,” for, though I did not
know much about business, I feared it confirmed what my father said:
however, I thought, ill news always came fast enough, so I resolved to
say nothing about my alarm, and merely told her that my father was well,
and sent his kind regards to her.  She kept turning over and admiring her
letter.  At last she spoke—

“I remember their sending one to Deborah just like this; but that I did
not wonder at, for everybody knew she was so clear-headed.  I am afraid I
could not help them much; indeed, if they came to accounts, I should be
quite in the way, for I never could do sums in my head.  Deborah, I know,
rather wished to go, and went so far as to order a new bonnet for the
occasion: but when the time came she had a bad cold; so they sent her a
very polite account of what they had done.  Chosen a director, I think it
was.  Do you think they want me to help them to choose a director?  I am
sure I should choose your father at once!’

“My father has no shares in the bank,” said I.

“Oh, no!  I remember.  He objected very much to Deborah’s buying any, I
believe.  But she was quite the woman of business, and always judged for
herself; and here, you see, they have paid eight per cent. all these
years.”

It was a very uncomfortable subject to me, with my half-knowledge; so I
thought I would change the conversation, and I asked at what time she
thought we had better go and see the fashions.  “Well, my dear,” she
said, “the thing is this: it is not etiquette to go till after twelve;
but then, you see, all Cranford will be there, and one does not like to
be too curious about dress and trimmings and caps with all the world
looking on.  It is never genteel to be over-curious on these occasions.
Deborah had the knack of always looking as if the latest fashion was
nothing new to her; a manner she had caught from Lady Arley, who did see
all the new modes in London, you know.  So I thought we would just slip
down—for I do want this morning, soon after breakfast half-a-pound of
tea—and then we could go up and examine the things at our leisure, and
see exactly how my new silk gown must be made; and then, after twelve, we
could go with our minds disengaged, and free from thoughts of dress.”

We began to talk of Miss Matty’s new silk gown.  I discovered that it
would be really the first time in her life that she had had to choose
anything of consequence for herself: for Miss Jenkyns had always been the
more decided character, whatever her taste might have been; and it is
astonishing how such people carry the world before them by the mere force
of will.  Miss Matty anticipated the sight of the glossy folds with as
much delight as if the five sovereigns, set apart for the purchase, could
buy all the silks in the shop; and (remembering my own loss of two hours
in a toyshop before I could tell on what wonder to spend a silver
threepence) I was very glad that we were going early, that dear Miss
Matty might have leisure for the delights of perplexity.

If a happy sea-green could be met with, the gown was to be sea-green: if
not, she inclined to maize, and I to silver gray; and we discussed the
requisite number of breadths until we arrived at the shop-door.  We were
to buy the tea, select the silk, and then clamber up the iron corkscrew
stairs that led into what was once a loft, though now a fashion
show-room.

The young men at Mr Johnson’s had on their best looks; and their best
cravats, and pivoted themselves over the counter with surprising
activity.  They wanted to show us upstairs at once; but on the principle
of business first and pleasure afterwards, we stayed to purchase the tea.
Here Miss Matty’s absence of mind betrayed itself.  If she was made aware
that she had been drinking green tea at any time, she always thought it
her duty to lie awake half through the night afterward (I have known her
take it in ignorance many a time without such effects), and consequently
green tea was prohibited the house; yet to-day she herself asked for the
obnoxious article, under the impression that she was talking about the
silk.  However, the mistake was soon rectified; and then the silks were
unrolled in good truth.  By this time the shop was pretty well filled,
for it was Cranford market-day, and many of the farmers and country
people from the neighbourhood round came in, sleeking down their hair,
and glancing shyly about, from under their eyelids, as anxious to take
back some notion of the unusual gaiety to the mistress or the lasses at
home, and yet feeling that they were out of place among the smart shopmen
and gay shawls and summer prints.  One honest-looking man, however, made
his way up to the counter at which we stood, and boldly asked to look at
a shawl or two.  The other country folk confined themselves to the
grocery side; but our neighbour was evidently too full of some kind
intention towards mistress, wife or daughter, to be shy; and it soon
became a question with me, whether he or Miss Matty would keep their
shopmen the longest time.  He thought each shawl more beautiful than the
last; and, as for Miss Matty, she smiled and sighed over each fresh bale
that was brought out; one colour set off another, and the heap together
would, as she said, make even the rainbow look poor.

“I am afraid,” said she, hesitating, “Whichever I choose I shall wish I
had taken another.  Look at this lovely crimson! it would be so warm in
winter.  But spring is coming on, you know.  I wish I could have a gown
for every season,” said she, dropping her voice—as we all did in Cranford
whenever we talked of anything we wished for but could not afford.
“However,” she continued in a louder and more cheerful tone, “it would
give me a great deal of trouble to take care of them if I had them; so, I
think, I’ll only take one.  But which must it be, my dear?”

And now she hovered over a lilac with yellow spots, while I pulled out a
quiet sage-green that had faded into insignificance under the more
brilliant colours, but which was nevertheless a good silk in its humble
way.  Our attention was called off to our neighbour.  He had chosen a
shawl of about thirty shillings’ value; and his face looked broadly
happy, under the anticipation, no doubt, of the pleasant surprise he
would give to some Molly or Jenny at home; he had tugged a leathern purse
out of his breeches-pocket, and had offered a five-pound note in payment
for the shawl, and for some parcels which had been brought round to him
from the grocery counter; and it was just at this point that he attracted
our notice.  The shopman was examining the note with a puzzled, doubtful
air.

“Town and County Bank!  I am not sure, sir, but I believe we have
received a warning against notes issued by this bank only this morning.
I will just step and ask Mr Johnson, sir; but I’m afraid I must trouble
you for payment in cash, or in a note of a different bank.”

I never saw a man’s countenance fall so suddenly into dismay and
bewilderment.  It was almost piteous to see the rapid change.

“Dang it!” said he, striking his fist down on the table, as if to try
which was the harder, “the chap talks as if notes and gold were to be had
for the picking up.”

Miss Matty had forgotten her silk gown in her interest for the man.  I
don’t think she had caught the name of the bank, and in my nervous
cowardice I was anxious that she should not; and so I began admiring the
yellow-spotted lilac gown that I had been utterly condemning only a
minute before.  But it was of no use.

“What bank was it?  I mean, what bank did your note belong to?”

“Town and County Bank.”

“Let me see it,” said she quietly to the shopman, gently taking it out of
his hand, as he brought it back to return it to the farmer.

Mr Johnson was very sorry, but, from information he had received, the
notes issued by that bank were little better than waste paper.

“I don’t understand it,” said Miss Matty to me in a low voice.  “That is
our bank, is it not?—the Town and County Bank?”

“Yes,” said I.  “This lilac silk will just match the ribbons in your new
cap, I believe,” I continued, holding up the folds so as to catch the
light, and wishing that the man would make haste and be gone, and yet
having a new wonder, that had only just sprung up, how far it was wise or
right in me to allow Miss Matty to make this expensive purchase, if the
affairs of the bank were really so bad as the refusal of the note
implied.

But Miss Matty put on the soft dignified manner, peculiar to her, rarely
used, and yet which became her so well, and laying her hand gently on
mine, she said—

“Never mind the silks for a few minutes, dear.  I don’t understand you,
sir,” turning now to the shopman, who had been attending to the farmer.
“Is this a forged note?”

“Oh, no, ma’am.  It is a true note of its kind; but you see, ma’am, it is
a joint-stock bank, and there are reports out that it is likely to break.
Mr Johnson is only doing his duty, ma’am, as I am sure Mr Dobson knows.”

But Mr Dobson could not respond to the appealing bow by any answering
smile.  He was turning the note absently over in his fingers, looking
gloomily enough at the parcel containing the lately-chosen shawl.

“It’s hard upon a poor man,” said he, “as earns every farthing with the
sweat of his brow.  However, there’s no help for it.  You must take back
your shawl, my man; Lizzle must go on with her cloak for a while.  And
yon figs for the little ones—I promised them to ’em—I’ll take them; but
the ’bacco, and the other things”—

“I will give you five sovereigns for your note, my good man,” said Miss
Matty.  “I think there is some great mistake about it, for I am one of
the shareholders, and I’m sure they would have told me if things had not
been going on right.”

The shopman whispered a word or two across the table to Miss Matty.  She
looked at him with a dubious air.

“Perhaps so,” said she.  “But I don’t pretend to understand business; I
only know that if it is going to fail, and if honest people are to lose
their money because they have taken our notes—I can’t explain myself,”
said she, suddenly becoming aware that she had got into a long sentence
with four people for audience; “only I would rather exchange my gold for
the note, if you please,” turning to the farmer, “and then you can take
your wife the shawl.  It is only going without my gown a few days
longer,” she continued, speaking to me.  “Then, I have no doubt,
everything will be cleared up.”

“But if it is cleared up the wrong way?” said I.

“Why, then it will only have been common honesty in me, as a shareholder,
to have given this good man the money.  I am quite clear about it in my
own mind; but, you know, I can never speak quite as comprehensibly as
others can, only you must give me your note, Mr Dobson, if you please,
and go on with your purchases with these sovereigns.”

     [Picture: You must give me your note, Mr Dobson, if you please]

The man looked at her with silent gratitude—too awkward to put his thanks
into words; but he hung back for a minute or two, fumbling with his note.

“I’m loth to make another one lose instead of me, if it is a loss; but,
you see, five pounds is a deal of money to a man with a family; and, as
you say, ten to one in a day or two the note will be as good as gold
again.”

“No hope of that, my friend,” said the shopman.

“The more reason why I should take it,” said Miss Matty quietly.  She
pushed her sovereigns towards the man, who slowly laid his note down in
exchange.  “Thank you.  I will wait a day or two before I purchase any of
these silks; perhaps you will then have a greater choice.  My dear, will
you come upstairs?”

We inspected the fashions with as minute and curious an interest as if
the gown to be made after them had been bought.  I could not see that the
little event in the shop below had in the least damped Miss Matty’s
curiosity as to the make of sleeves or the sit of skirts.  She once or
twice exchanged congratulations with me on our private and leisurely view
of the bonnets and shawls; but I was, all the time, not so sure that our
examination was so utterly private, for I caught glimpses of a figure
dodging behind the cloaks and mantles; and, by a dexterous move, I came
face to face with Miss Pole, also in morning costume (the principal
feature of which was her being without teeth, and wearing a veil to
conceal the deficiency), come on the same errand as ourselves.  But she
quickly took her departure, because, as she said, she had a bad headache,
and did not feel herself up to conversation.

As we came down through the shop, the civil Mr Johnson was awaiting us;
he had been informed of the exchange of the note for gold, and with much
good feeling and real kindness, but with a little want of tact, he wished
to condole with Miss Matty, and impress upon her the true state of the
case.  I could only hope that he had heard an exaggerated rumour for he
said that her shares were worse than nothing, and that the bank could not
pay a shilling in the pound.  I was glad that Miss Matty seemed still a
little incredulous; but I could not tell how much of this was real or
assumed, with that self-control which seemed habitual to ladies of Miss
Matty’s standing in Cranford, who would have thought their dignity
compromised by the slightest expression of surprise, dismay, or any
similar feeling to an inferior in station, or in a public shop.  However,
we walked home very silently.  I am ashamed to say, I believe I was
rather vexed and annoyed at Miss Matty’s conduct in taking the note to
herself so decidedly.  I had so set my heart upon her having a new silk
gown, which she wanted sadly; in general she was so undecided anybody
might turn her round; in this case I had felt that it was no use
attempting it, but I was not the less put out at the result.

Somehow, after twelve o’clock, we both acknowledged to a sated curiosity
about the fashions, and to a certain fatigue of body (which was, in fact,
depression of mind) that indisposed us to go out again.  But still we
never spoke of the note; till, all at once, something possessed me to ask
Miss Matty if she would think it her duty to offer sovereigns for all the
notes of the Town and County Bank she met with?  I could have bitten my
tongue out the minute I had said it.  She looked up rather sadly, and as
if I had thrown a new perplexity into her already distressed mind; and
for a minute or two she did not speak.  Then she said—my own dear Miss
Matty—without a shade of reproach in her voice—

“My dear, I never feel as if my mind was what people call very strong;
and it’s often hard enough work for me to settle what I ought to do with
the case right before me.  I was very thankful to—I was very thankful,
that I saw my duty this morning, with the poor man standing by me; but
its rather a strain upon me to keep thinking and thinking what I should
do if such and such a thing happened; and, I believe, I had rather wait
and see what really does come; and I don’t doubt I shall be helped then
if I don’t fidget myself, and get too anxious beforehand.  You know,
love, I’m not like Deborah.  If Deborah had lived, I’ve no doubt she
would have seen after them, before they had got themselves into this
state.”

We had neither of us much appetite for dinner, though we tried to talk
cheerfully about indifferent things.  When we returned into the
drawing-room, Miss Matty unlocked her desk and began to look over her
account-books.  I was so penitent for what I had said in the morning,
that I did not choose to take upon myself the presumption to suppose that
I could assist her; I rather left her alone, as, with puzzled brow, her
eye followed her pen up and down the ruled page.  By-and-by she shut the
book, locked the desk, and came and drew a chair to mine, where I sat in
moody sorrow over the fire.  I stole my hand into hers; she clasped it,
but did not speak a word.  At last she said, with forced composure in her
voice, “If that bank goes wrong, I shall lose one hundred and forty-nine
pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a year; I shall only have
thirteen pounds a year left.”  I squeezed her hand hard and tight.  I did
not know what to say.  Presently (it was too dark to see her face) I felt
her fingers work convulsively in my grasp; and I knew she was going to
speak again.  I heard the sobs in her voice as she said, “I hope it’s not
wrong—not wicked—but, oh!  I am so glad poor Deborah is spared this.  She
could not have borne to come down in the world—she had such a noble,
lofty spirit.”

This was all she said about the sister who had insisted upon investing
their little property in that unlucky bank.  We were later in lighting
the candle than usual that night, and until that light shamed us into
speaking, we sat together very silently and sadly.

However, we took to our work after tea with a kind of forced cheerfulness
(which soon became real as far as it went), talking of that never-ending
wonder, Lady Glenmire’s engagement.  Miss Matty was almost coming round
to think it a good thing.

“I don’t mean to deny that men are troublesome in a house.  I don’t judge
from my own experience, for my father was neatness itself, and wiped his
shoes on coming in as carefully as any woman; but still a man has a sort
of knowledge of what should be done in difficulties, that it is very
pleasant to have one at hand ready to lean upon.  Now, Lady Glenmire,
instead of being tossed about, and wondering where she is to settle, will
be certain of a home among pleasant and kind people, such as our good
Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester.  And Mr Hoggins is really a very personable
man; and as for his manners, why, if they are not very polished, I have
known people with very good hearts and very clever minds too, who were
not what some people reckoned refined, but who were both true and
tender.”

She fell off into a soft reverie about Mr Holbrook, and I did not
interrupt her, I was so busy maturing a plan I had had in my mind for
some days, but which this threatened failure of the bank had brought to a
crisis.  That night, after Miss Matty went to bed, I treacherously
lighted the candle again, and sat down in the drawing-room to compose a
letter to the Aga Jenkyns, a letter which should affect him if he were
Peter, and yet seem a mere statement of dry facts if he were a stranger.
The church clock pealed out two before I had done.

The next morning news came, both official and otherwise, that the Town
and County Bank had stopped payment.  Miss Matty was ruined.

She tried to speak quietly to me; but when she came to the actual fact
that she would have but about five shillings a week to live upon, she
could not restrain a few tears.

“I am not crying for myself, dear,” said she, wiping them away; “I
believe I am crying for the very silly thought of how my mother would
grieve if she could know; she always cared for us so much more than for
herself.  But many a poor person has less, and I am not very extravagant,
and, thank God, when the neck of mutton, and Martha’s wages, and the rent
are paid, I have not a farthing owing.  Poor Martha!  I think she’ll be
sorry to leave me.”

Miss Matty smiled at me through her tears, and she would fain have had me
see only the smile, not the tears.




CHAPTER XIV—FRIENDS IN NEED


IT was an example to me, and I fancy it might be to many others, to see
how immediately Miss Matty set about the retrenchment which she knew to
be right under her altered circumstances.  While she went down to speak
to Martha, and break the intelligence to her, I stole out with my letter
to the Aga Jenkyns, and went to the signor’s lodgings to obtain the exact
address.  I bound the signora to secrecy; and indeed her military manners
had a degree of shortness and reserve in them which made her always say
as little as possible, except when under the pressure of strong
excitement.  Moreover (which made my secret doubly sure), the signor was
now so far recovered as to be looking forward to travelling and conjuring
again in the space of a few days, when he, his wife, and little Phoebe
would leave Cranford.  Indeed, I found him looking over a great black and
red placard, in which the Signor Brunoni’s accomplishments were set
forth, and to which only the name of the town where he would next display
them was wanting.  He and his wife were so much absorbed in deciding
where the red letters would come in with most effect (it might have been
the Rubric for that matter), that it was some time before I could get my
question asked privately, and not before I had given several decisions,
the which I questioned afterwards with equal wisdom of sincerity as soon
as the signor threw in his doubts and reasons on the important subject.
At last I got the address, spelt by sound, and very queer it looked.  I
dropped it in the post on my way home, and then for a minute I stood
looking at the wooden pane with a gaping slit which divided me from the
letter but a moment ago in my hand.  It was gone from me like life, never
to be recalled.  It would get tossed about on the sea, and stained with
sea-waves perhaps, and be carried among palm-trees, and scented with all
tropical fragrance; the little piece of paper, but an hour ago so
familiar and commonplace, had set out on its race to the strange wild
countries beyond the Ganges!  But I could not afford to lose much time on
this speculation.  I hastened home, that Miss Matty might not miss me.
Martha opened the door to me, her face swollen with crying.  As soon as
she saw me she burst out afresh, and taking hold of my arm she pulled me
in, and banged the door to, in order to ask me if indeed it was all true
that Miss Matty had been saying.

“I’ll never leave her!  No; I won’t.  I telled her so, and said I could
not think how she could find in her heart to give me warning.  I could
not have had the face to do it, if I’d been her.  I might ha’ been just
as good for nothing as Mrs Fitz-Adam’s Rosy, who struck for wages after
living seven years and a half in one place.  I said I was not one to go
and serve Mammon at that rate; that I knew when I’d got a good missus, if
she didn’t know when she’d got a good servant”—

“But, Martha,” said I, cutting in while she wiped her eyes.

“Don’t, ‘but Martha’ me,” she replied to my deprecatory tone.

“Listen to reason”—

“I’ll not listen to reason,” she said, now in full possession of her
voice, which had been rather choked with sobbing.  “Reason always means
what someone else has got to say.  Now I think what I’ve got to say is
good enough reason; but reason or not, I’ll say it, and I’ll stick to it.
I’ve money in the Savings Bank, and I’ve a good stock of clothes, and I’m
not going to leave Miss Matty.  No, not if she gives me warning every
hour in the day!”

She put her arms akimbo, as much as to say she defied me; and, indeed, I
could hardly tell how to begin to remonstrate with her, so much did I
feel that Miss Matty, in her increasing infirmity, needed the attendance
of this kind and faithful woman.

“Well”—said I at last.

“I’m thankful you begin with ‘well!’  If you’d have begun with ‘but,’ as
you did afore, I’d not ha’ listened to you.  Now you may go on.”

“I know you would be a great loss to Miss Matty, Martha”—

“I telled her so.  A loss she’d never cease to be sorry for,” broke in
Martha triumphantly.

“Still, she will have so little—so very little—to live upon, that I don’t
see just now how she could find you food—she will even be pressed for her
own.  I tell you this, Martha, because I feel you are like a friend to
dear Miss Matty, but you know she might not like to have it spoken
about.”

Apparently this was even a blacker view of the subject than Miss Matty
had presented to her, for Martha just sat down on the first chair that
came to hand, and cried out loud (we had been standing in the kitchen).

At last she put her apron down, and looking me earnestly in the face,
asked, “Was that the reason Miss Matty wouldn’t order a pudding to-day?
She said she had no great fancy for sweet things, and you and she would
just have a mutton chop.  But I’ll be up to her.  Never you tell, but
I’ll make her a pudding, and a pudding she’ll like, too, and I’ll pay for
it myself; so mind you see she eats it.  Many a one has been comforted in
their sorrow by seeing a good dish come upon the table.”

I was rather glad that Martha’s energy had taken the immediate and
practical direction of pudding-making, for it staved off the quarrelsome
discussion as to whether she should or should not leave Miss Matty’s
service.  She began to tie on a clean apron, and otherwise prepare
herself for going to the shop for the butter, eggs, and what else she
might require.  She would not use a scrap of the articles already in the
house for her cookery, but went to an old tea-pot in which her private
store of money was deposited, and took out what she wanted.

I found Miss Matty very quiet, and not a little sad; but by-and-by she
tried to smile for my sake.  It was settled that I was to write to my
father, and ask him to come over and hold a consultation, and as soon as
this letter was despatched we began to talk over future plans.  Miss
Matty’s idea was to take a single room, and retain as much of her
furniture as would be necessary to fit up this, and sell the rest, and
there to quietly exist upon what would remain after paying the rent.  For
my part, I was more ambitious and less contented.  I thought of all the
things by which a woman, past middle age, and with the education common
to ladies fifty years ago, could earn or add to a living without
materially losing caste; but at length I put even this last clause on one
side, and wondered what in the world Miss Matty could do.

Teaching was, of course, the first thing that suggested itself.  If Miss
Matty could teach children anything, it would throw her among the little
elves in whom her soul delighted.  I ran over her accomplishments.  Once
upon a time I had heard her say she could play “Ah! vous dirai-je,
maman?” on the piano, but that was long, long ago; that faint shadow of
musical acquirement had died out years before.  She had also once been
able to trace out patterns very nicely for muslin embroidery, by dint of
placing a piece of silver paper over the design to be copied, and holding
both against the window-pane while she marked the scollop and
eyelet-holes.  But that was her nearest approach to the accomplishment of
drawing, and I did not think it would go very far.  Then again, as to the
branches of a solid English education—fancy work and the use of the
globes—such as the mistress of the Ladies’ Seminary, to which all the
tradespeople in Cranford sent their daughters, professed to teach.  Miss
Matty’s eyes were failing her, and I doubted if she could discover the
number of threads in a worsted-work pattern, or rightly appreciate the
different shades required for Queen Adelaide’s face in the loyal
wool-work now fashionable in Cranford.  As for the use of the globes, I
had never been able to find it out myself, so perhaps I was not a good
judge of Miss Matty’s capability of instructing in this branch of
education; but it struck me that equators and tropics, and such mystical
circles, were very imaginary lines indeed to her, and that she looked
upon the signs of the Zodiac as so many remnants of the Black Art.

What she piqued herself upon, as arts in which she excelled, was making
candle-lighters, or “spills” (as she preferred calling them), of coloured
paper, cut so as to resemble feathers, and knitting garters in a variety
of dainty stitches.  I had once said, on receiving a present of an
elaborate pair, that I should feel quite tempted to drop one of them in
the street, in order to have it admired; but I found this little joke
(and it was a very little one) was such a distress to her sense of
propriety, and was taken with such anxious, earnest alarm, lest the
temptation might some day prove too strong for me, that I quite regretted
having ventured upon it.  A present of these delicately-wrought garters,
a bunch of gay “spills,” or a set of cards on which sewing-silk was wound
in a mystical manner, were the well-known tokens of Miss Matty’s favour.
But would any one pay to have their children taught these arts? or,
indeed, would Miss Matty sell, for filthy lucre, the knack and the skill
with which she made trifles of value to those who loved her?

I had to come down to reading, writing, and arithmetic; and, in reading
the chapter every morning, she always coughed before coming to long
words.  I doubted her power of getting through a genealogical chapter,
with any number of coughs.  Writing she did well and delicately—but
spelling!  She seemed to think that the more out-of-the-way this was, and
the more trouble it cost her, the greater the compliment she paid to her
correspondent; and words that she would spell quite correctly in her
letters to me became perfect enigmas when she wrote to my father.

No! there was nothing she could teach to the rising generation of
Cranford, unless they had been quick learners and ready imitators of her
patience, her humility, her sweetness, her quiet contentment with all
that she could not do.  I pondered and pondered until dinner was
announced by Martha, with a face all blubbered and swollen with crying.

Miss Matty had a few little peculiarities which Martha was apt to regard
as whims below her attention, and appeared to consider as childish
fancies of which an old lady of fifty-eight should try and cure herself.
But to-day everything was attended to with the most careful regard.  The
bread was cut to the imaginary pattern of excellence that existed in Miss
Matty’s mind, as being the way which her mother had preferred, the
curtain was drawn so as to exclude the dead brick wall of a neighbour’s
stable, and yet left so as to show every tender leaf of the poplar which
was bursting into spring beauty.  Martha’s tone to Miss Matty was just
such as that good, rough-spoken servant usually kept sacred for little
children, and which I had never heard her use to any grown-up person.

I had forgotten to tell Miss Matty about the pudding, and I was afraid
she might not do justice to it, for she had evidently very little
appetite this day; so I seized the opportunity of letting her into the
secret while Martha took away the meat.  Miss Matty’s eyes filled with
tears, and she could not speak, either to express surprise or delight,
when Martha returned bearing it aloft, made in the most wonderful
representation of a lion _couchant_ that ever was moulded.  Martha’s face
gleamed with triumph as she set it down before Miss Matty with an
exultant “There!”  Miss Matty wanted to speak her thanks, but could not;
so she took Martha’s hand and shook it warmly, which set Martha off
crying, and I myself could hardly keep up the necessary composure.
Martha burst out of the room, and Miss Matty had to clear her voice once
or twice before she could speak.  At last she said, “I should like to
keep this pudding under a glass shade, my dear!” and the notion of the
lion _couchant_, with his currant eyes, being hoisted up to the place of
honour on a mantelpiece, tickled my hysterical fancy, and I began to
laugh, which rather surprised Miss Matty.

“I am sure, dear, I have seen uglier things under a glass shade before
now,” said she.

So had I, many a time and oft, and I accordingly composed my countenance
(and now I could hardly keep from crying), and we both fell to upon the
pudding, which was indeed excellent—only every morsel seemed to choke us,
our hearts were so full.

We had too much to think about to talk much that afternoon.  It passed
over very tranquilly.  But when the tea-urn was brought in a new thought
came into my head.  Why should not Miss Matty sell tea—be an agent to the
East India Tea Company which then existed?  I could see no objections to
this plan, while the advantages were many—always supposing that Miss
Matty could get over the degradation of condescending to anything like
trade.  Tea was neither greasy nor sticky—grease and stickiness being two
of the qualities which Miss Matty could not endure.  No shop-window would
be required.  A small, genteel notification of her being licensed to sell
tea would, it is true, be necessary, but I hoped that it could be placed
where no one would see it.  Neither was tea a heavy article, so as to tax
Miss Matty’s fragile strength.  The only thing against my plan was the
buying and selling involved.

While I was giving but absent answers to the questions Miss Matty was
putting—almost as absently—we heard a clumping sound on the stairs, and a
whispering outside the door, which indeed once opened and shut as if by
some invisible agency.  After a little while Martha came in, dragging
after her a great tall young man, all crimson with shyness, and finding
his only relief in perpetually sleeking down his hair.

“Please, ma’am, he’s only Jem Hearn,” said Martha, by way of an
introduction; and so out of breath was she that I imagine she had had
some bodily struggle before she could overcome his reluctance to be
presented on the courtly scene of Miss Matilda Jenkyns’s drawing-room.

“And please, ma’am, he wants to marry me off-hand.  And please, ma’am, we
want to take a lodger—just one quiet lodger, to make our two ends meet;
and we’d take any house conformable; and, oh dear Miss Matty, if I may be
so bold, would you have any objections to lodging with us?  Jem wants it
as much as I do.”  [To Jem ]—“You great oaf! why can’t you back me!—But
he does want it all the same, very bad—don’t you, Jem?—only, you see,
he’s dazed at being called on to speak before quality.”

         [Picture: Please, ma’am, he wants to marry me off-hand]

“It’s not that,” broke in Jem.  “It’s that you’ve taken me all on a
sudden, and I didn’t think for to get married so soon—and such quick
words does flabbergast a man.  It’s not that I’m against it, ma’am”
(addressing Miss Matty), “only Martha has such quick ways with her when
once she takes a thing into her head; and marriage, ma’am—marriage nails
a man, as one may say.  I dare say I shan’t mind it after it’s once
over.”

“Please, ma’am,” said Martha—who had plucked at his sleeve, and nudged
him with her elbow, and otherwise tried to interrupt him all the time he
had been speaking—“don’t mind him, he’ll come to; ’twas only last night
he was an-axing me, and an-axing me, and all the more because I said I
could not think of it for years to come, and now he’s only taken aback
with the suddenness of the joy; but you know, Jem, you are just as full
as me about wanting a lodger.”  (Another great nudge.)

“Ay! if Miss Matty would lodge with us—otherwise I’ve no mind to be
cumbered with strange folk in the house,” said Jem, with a want of tact
which I could see enraged Martha, who was trying to represent a lodger as
the great object they wished to obtain, and that, in fact, Miss Matty
would be smoothing their path and conferring a favour, if she would only
come and live with them.

Miss Matty herself was bewildered by the pair; their, or rather Martha’s
sudden resolution in favour of matrimony staggered her, and stood between
her and the contemplation of the plan which Martha had at heart.  Miss
Matty began—

“Marriage is a very solemn thing, Martha.”

“It is indeed, ma’am,” quoth Jem.  “Not that I’ve no objections to
Martha.”

“You’ve never let me a-be for asking me for to fix when I would be
married,” said Martha—her face all a-fire, and ready to cry with
vexation—“and now you’re shaming me before my missus and all.”

“Nay, now!  Martha don’t ee! don’t ee! only a man likes to have
breathing-time,” said Jem, trying to possess himself of her hand, but in
vain.  Then seeing that she was more seriously hurt than he had imagined,
he seemed to try to rally his scattered faculties, and with more
straightforward dignity than, ten minutes before, I should have thought
it possible for him to assume, he turned to Miss Matty, and said, “I
hope, ma’am, you know that I am bound to respect every one who has been
kind to Martha.  I always looked on her as to be my wife—some time; and
she has often and often spoken of you as the kindest lady that ever was;
and though the plain truth is, I would not like to be troubled with
lodgers of the common run, yet if, ma’am, you’d honour us by living with
us, I’m sure Martha would do her best to make you comfortable; and I’d
keep out of your way as much as I could, which I reckon would be the best
kindness such an awkward chap as me could do.”

Miss Matty had been very busy with taking off her spectacles, wiping
them, and replacing them; but all she could say was, “Don’t let any
thought of me hurry you into marriage: pray don’t.  Marriage is such a
very solemn thing!”

“But Miss Matilda will think of your plan, Martha,” said I, struck with
the advantages that it offered, and unwilling to lose the opportunity of
considering about it.  “And I’m sure neither she nor I can ever forget
your kindness; nor your’s either, Jem.”

“Why, yes, ma’am!  I’m sure I mean kindly, though I’m a bit fluttered by
being pushed straight ahead into matrimony, as it were, and mayn’t
express myself conformable.  But I’m sure I’m willing enough, and give me
time to get accustomed; so, Martha, wench, what’s the use of crying so,
and slapping me if I come near?”

This last was _sotto voce_, and had the effect of making Martha bounce
out of the room, to be followed and soothed by her lover.  Whereupon Miss
Matty sat down and cried very heartily, and accounted for it by saying
that the thought of Martha being married so soon gave her quite a shock,
and that she should never forgive herself if she thought she was hurrying
the poor creature.  I think my pity was more for Jem, of the two; but
both Miss Matty and I appreciated to the full the kindness of the honest
couple, although we said little about this, and a good deal about the
chances and dangers of matrimony.

The next morning, very early, I received a note from Miss Pole, so
mysteriously wrapped up, and with so many seals on it to secure secrecy,
that I had to tear the paper before I could unfold it.  And when I came
to the writing I could hardly understand the meaning, it was so involved
and oracular.  I made out, however, that I was to go to Miss Pole’s at
eleven o’clock; the number _eleven_ being written in full length as well
as in numerals, and _A.M._ twice dashed under, as if I were very likely
to come at eleven at night, when all Cranford was usually a-bed and
asleep by ten.  There was no signature except Miss Pole’s initials
reversed, P.E.; but as Martha had given me the note, “with Miss Pole’s
kind regards,” it needed no wizard to find out who sent it; and if the
writer’s name was to be kept secret, it was very well that I was alone
when Martha delivered it.

I went as requested to Miss Pole’s.  The door was opened to me by her
little maid Lizzy in Sunday trim, as if some grand event was impending
over this work-day.  And the drawing-room upstairs was arranged in
accordance with this idea.  The table was set out with the best green
card-cloth, and writing materials upon it.  On the little chiffonier was
a tray with a newly-decanted bottle of cowslip wine, and some
ladies’-finger biscuits.  Miss Pole herself was in solemn array, as if to
receive visitors, although it was only eleven o’clock.  Mrs Forrester was
there, crying quietly and sadly, and my arrival seemed only to call forth
fresh tears.  Before we had finished our greetings, performed with
lugubrious mystery of demeanour, there was another rat-tat-tat, and Mrs
Fitz-Adam appeared, crimson with walking and excitement.  It seemed as if
this was all the company expected; for now Miss Pole made several
demonstrations of being about to open the business of the meeting, by
stirring the fire, opening and shutting the door, and coughing and
blowing her nose.  Then she arranged us all round the table, taking care
to place me opposite to her; and last of all, she inquired of me if the
sad report was true, as she feared it was, that Miss Matty had lost all
her fortune?

Of course, I had but one answer to make; and I never saw more unaffected
sorrow depicted on any countenances than I did there on the three before
me.

“I wish Mrs Jamieson was here!” said Mrs Forrester at last; but to judge
from Mrs Fitz-Adam’s face, she could not second the wish.

“But without Mrs Jamieson,” said Miss Pole, with just a sound of offended
merit in her voice, “we, the ladies of Cranford, in my drawing-room
assembled, can resolve upon something.  I imagine we are none of us what
may be called rich, though we all possess a genteel competency,
sufficient for tastes that are elegant and refined, and would not, if
they could, be vulgarly ostentatious.”  (Here I observed Miss Pole refer
to a small card concealed in her hand, on which I imagine she had put
down a few notes.)

“Miss Smith,” she continued, addressing me (familiarly known as “Mary” to
all the company assembled, but this was a state occasion), “I have
conversed in private—I made it my business to do so yesterday
afternoon—with these ladies on the misfortune which has happened to our
friend, and one and all of us have agreed that while we have a
superfluity, it is not only a duty, but a pleasure—a true pleasure,
Mary!”—her voice was rather choked just here, and she had to wipe her
spectacles before she could go on—“to give what we can to assist her—Miss
Matilda Jenkyns.  Only in consideration of the feelings of delicate
independence existing in the mind of every refined female”—I was sure she
had got back to the card now—“we wish to contribute our mites in a secret
and concealed manner, so as not to hurt the feelings I have referred to.
And our object in requesting you to meet us this morning is that,
believing you are the daughter—that your father is, in fact, her
confidential adviser, in all pecuniary matters, we imagined that, by
consulting with him, you might devise some mode in which our contribution
could be made to appear the legal due which Miss Matilda Jenkyns ought to
receive from—  Probably your father, knowing her investments, can fill up
the blank.”

Miss Pole concluded her address, and looked round for approval and
agreement.

“I have expressed your meaning, ladies, have I not?  And while Miss Smith
considers what reply to make, allow me to offer you some little
refreshment.”

I had no great reply to make: I had more thankfulness at my heart for
their kind thoughts than I cared to put into words; and so I only mumbled
out something to the effect “that I would name what Miss Pole had said to
my father, and that if anything could be arranged for dear Miss
Matty,”—and here I broke down utterly, and had to be refreshed with a
glass of cowslip wine before I could check the crying which had been
repressed for the last two or three days.  The worst was, all the ladies
cried in concert.  Even Miss Pole cried, who had said a hundred times
that to betray emotion before any one was a sign of weakness and want of
self-control.  She recovered herself into a slight degree of impatient
anger, directed against me, as having set them all off; and, moreover, I
think she was vexed that I could not make a speech back in return for
hers; and if I had known beforehand what was to be said, and had a card
on which to express the probable feelings that would rise in my heart, I
would have tried to gratify her.  As it was, Mrs Forrester was the person
to speak when we had recovered our composure.

“I don’t mind, among friends, stating that I—no!  I’m not poor exactly,
but I don’t think I’m what you may call rich; I wish I were, for dear
Miss Matty’s sake—but, if you please, I’ll write down in a sealed paper
what I can give.  I only wish it was more; my dear Mary, I do indeed.”

Now I saw why paper, pens, and ink were provided.  Every lady wrote down
the sum she could give annually, signed the paper, and sealed it
mysteriously.  If their proposal was acceded to, my father was to be
allowed to open the papers, under pledge of secrecy.  If not, they were
to be returned to their writers.

When the ceremony had been gone through, I rose to depart; but each lady
seemed to wish to have a private conference with me.  Miss Pole kept me
in the drawing-room to explain why, in Mrs Jamieson’s absence, she had
taken the lead in this “movement,” as she was pleased to call it, and
also to inform me that she had heard from good sources that Mrs Jamieson
was coming home directly in a state of high displeasure against her
sister-in-law, who was forthwith to leave her house, and was, she
believed, to return to Edinburgh that very afternoon.  Of course this
piece of intelligence could not be communicated before Mrs Fitz-Adam,
more especially as Miss Pole was inclined to think that Lady Glenmire’s
engagement to Mr Hoggins could not possibly hold against the blaze of Mrs
Jamieson’s displeasure.  A few hearty inquiries after Miss Matty’s health
concluded my interview with Miss Pole.

On coming downstairs I found Mrs Forrester waiting for me at the entrance
to the dining-parlour; she drew me in, and when the door was shut, she
tried two or three times to begin on some subject, which was so
unapproachable apparently, that I began to despair of our ever getting to
a clear understanding.  At last out it came; the poor old lady trembling
all the time as if it were a great crime which she was exposing to
daylight, in telling me how very, very little she had to live upon; a
confession which she was brought to make from a dread lest we should
think that the small contribution named in her paper bore any proportion
to her love and regard for Miss Matty.  And yet that sum which she so
eagerly relinquished was, in truth, more than a twentieth part of what
she had to live upon, and keep house, and a little serving-maid, all as
became one born a Tyrrell.  And when the whole income does not nearly
amount to a hundred pounds, to give up a twentieth of it will necessitate
many careful economies, and many pieces of self-denial, small and
insignificant in the world’s account, but bearing a different value in
another account-book that I have heard of.  She did so wish she was rich,
she said, and this wish she kept repeating, with no thought of herself in
it, only with a longing, yearning desire to be able to heap up Miss
Matty’s measure of comforts.

It was some time before I could console her enough to leave her; and
then, on quitting the house, I was waylaid by Mrs Fitz-Adam, who had also
her confidence to make of pretty nearly the opposite description.  She
had not liked to put down all that she could afford and was ready to
give.  She told me she thought she never could look Miss Matty in the
face again if she presumed to be giving her so much as she should like to
do.  “Miss Matty!” continued she, “that I thought was such a fine young
lady when I was nothing but a country girl, coming to market with eggs
and butter and such like things.  For my father, though well-to-do, would
always make me go on as my mother had done before me, and I had to come
into Cranford every Saturday, and see after sales, and prices, and what
not.  And one day, I remember, I met Miss Matty in the lane that leads to
Combehurst; she was walking on the footpath, which, you know, is raised a
good way above the road, and a gentleman rode beside her, and was talking
to her, and she was looking down at some primroses she had gathered, and
pulling them all to pieces, and I do believe she was crying.  But after
she had passed, she turned round and ran after me to ask—oh, so
kindly—about my poor mother, who lay on her death-bed; and when I cried
she took hold of my hand to comfort me—and the gentleman waiting for her
all the time—and her poor heart very full of something, I am sure; and I
thought it such an honour to be spoken to in that pretty way by the
rector’s daughter, who visited at Arley Hall.  I have loved her ever
since, though perhaps I’d no right to do it; but if you can think of any
way in which I might be allowed to give a little more without any one
knowing it, I should be so much obliged to you, my dear.  And my brother
would be delighted to doctor her for nothing—medicines, leeches, and all.
I know that he and her ladyship (my dear, I little thought in the days I
was telling you of that I should ever come to be sister-in-law to a
ladyship!) would do anything for her.  We all would.”

I told her I was quite sure of it, and promised all sorts of things in my
anxiety to get home to Miss Matty, who might well be wondering what had
become of me—absent from her two hours without being able to account for
it.  She had taken very little note of time, however, as she had been
occupied in numberless little arrangements preparatory to the great step
of giving up her house.  It was evidently a relief to her to be doing
something in the way of retrenchment, for, as she said, whenever she
paused to think, the recollection of the poor fellow with his bad
five-pound note came over her, and she felt quite dishonest; only if it
made her so uncomfortable, what must it not be doing to the directors of
the bank, who must know so much more of the misery consequent upon this
failure?  She almost made me angry by dividing her sympathy between these
directors (whom she imagined overwhelmed by self-reproach for the
mismanagement of other people’s affairs) and those who were suffering
like her.  Indeed, of the two, she seemed to think poverty a lighter
burden than self-reproach; but I privately doubted if the directors would
agree with her.

Old hoards were taken out and examined as to their money value which
luckily was small, or else I don’t know how Miss Matty would have
prevailed upon herself to part with such things as her mother’s
wedding-ring, the strange, uncouth brooch with which her father had
disfigured his shirt-frill, &c.  However, we arranged things a little in
order as to their pecuniary estimation, and were all ready for my father
when he came the next morning.

I am not going to weary you with the details of all the business we went
through; and one reason for not telling about them is, that I did not
understand what we were doing at the time, and cannot recollect it now.
Miss Matty and I sat assenting to accounts, and schemes, and reports, and
documents, of which I do not believe we either of us understood a word;
for my father was clear-headed and decisive, and a capital man of
business, and if we made the slightest inquiry, or expressed the
slightest want of comprehension, he had a sharp way of saying, “Eh? eh?
it’s as clear as daylight.  What’s your objection?”  And as we had not
comprehended anything of what he had proposed, we found it rather
difficult to shape our objections; in fact, we never were sure if we had
any.  So presently Miss Matty got into a nervously acquiescent state, and
said “Yes,” and “Certainly,” at every pause, whether required or not; but
when I once joined in as chorus to a “Decidedly,” pronounced by Miss
Matty in a tremblingly dubious tone, my father fired round at me and
asked me “What there was to decide?”  And I am sure to this day I have
never known.  But, in justice to him, I must say he had come over from
Drumble to help Miss Matty when he could ill spare the time, and when his
own affairs were in a very anxious state.

          [Picture: Miss Matty and I sat assenting to accounts]

While Miss Matty was out of the room giving orders for luncheon—and sadly
perplexed between her desire of honouring my father by a delicate, dainty
meal, and her conviction that she had no right, now that all her money
was gone, to indulge this desire—I told him of the meeting of the
Cranford ladies at Miss Pole’s the day before.  He kept brushing his hand
before his eyes as I spoke—and when I went back to Martha’s offer the
evening before, of receiving Miss Matty as a lodger, he fairly walked
away from me to the window, and began drumming with his fingers upon it.
Then he turned abruptly round, and said, “See, Mary, how a good, innocent
life makes friends all around.  Confound it!  I could make a good lesson
out of it if I were a parson; but, as it is, I can’t get a tail to my
sentences—only I’m sure you feel what I want to say.  You and I will have
a walk after lunch and talk a bit more about these plans.”

The lunch—a hot savoury mutton-chop, and a little of the cold loin sliced
and fried—was now brought in.  Every morsel of this last dish was
finished, to Martha’s great gratification.  Then my father bluntly told
Miss Matty he wanted to talk to me alone, and that he would stroll out
and see some of the old places, and then I could tell her what plan we
thought desirable.  Just before we went out, she called me back and said,
“Remember, dear, I’m the only one left—I mean, there’s no one to be hurt
by what I do.  I’m willing to do anything that’s right and honest; and I
don’t think, if Deborah knows where she is, she’ll care so very much if
I’m not genteel; because, you see, she’ll know all, dear.  Only let me
see what I can do, and pay the poor people as far as I’m able.”

I gave her a hearty kiss, and ran after my father.  The result of our
conversation was this.  If all parties were agreeable, Martha and Jem
were to be married with as little delay as possible, and they were to
live on in Miss Matty’s present abode; the sum which the Cranford ladies
had agreed to contribute annually being sufficient to meet the greater
part of the rent, and leaving Martha free to appropriate what Miss Matty
should pay for her lodgings to any little extra comforts required.  About
the sale, my father was dubious at first.  He said the old rectory
furniture, however carefully used and reverently treated, would fetch
very little; and that little would be but as a drop in the sea of the
debts of the Town and County Bank.  But when I represented how Miss
Matty’s tender conscience would be soothed by feeling that she had done
what she could, he gave way; especially after I had told him the
five-pound note adventure, and he had scolded me well for allowing it.  I
then alluded to my idea that she might add to her small income by selling
tea; and, to my surprise (for I had nearly given up the plan), my father
grasped at it with all the energy of a tradesman.  I think he reckoned
his chickens before they were hatched, for he immediately ran up the
profits of the sales that she could effect in Cranford to more than
twenty pounds a year.  The small dining-parlour was to be converted into
a shop, without any of its degrading characteristics; a table was to be
the counter; one window was to be retained unaltered, and the other
changed into a glass door.  I evidently rose in his estimation for having
made this bright suggestion.  I only hoped we should not both fall in
Miss Matty’s.

But she was patient and content with all our arrangements.  She knew, she
said, that we should do the best we could for her; and she only hoped,
only stipulated, that she should pay every farthing that she could be
said to owe, for her father’s sake, who had been so respected in
Cranford.  My father and I had agreed to say as little as possible about
the bank, indeed never to mention it again, if it could be helped.  Some
of the plans were evidently a little perplexing to her; but she had seen
me sufficiently snubbed in the morning for want of comprehension to
venture on too many inquiries now; and all passed over well with a hope
on her part that no one would be hurried into marriage on her account.
When we came to the proposal that she should sell tea, I could see it was
rather a shock to her; not on account of any personal loss of gentility
involved, but only because she distrusted her own powers of action in a
new line of life, and would timidly have preferred a little more
privation to any exertion for which she feared she was unfitted.
However, when she saw my father was bent upon it, she sighed, and said
she would try; and if she did not do well, of course she might give it
up.  One good thing about it was, she did not think men ever bought tea;
and it was of men particularly she was afraid.  They had such sharp loud
ways with them; and did up accounts, and counted their change so quickly!
Now, if she might only sell comfits to children, she was sure she could
please them!




CHAPTER XV—A HAPPY RETURN


BEFORE I left Miss Matty at Cranford everything had been comfortably
arranged for her.  Even Mrs Jamieson’s approval of her selling tea had
been gained.  That oracle had taken a few days to consider whether by so
doing Miss Matty would forfeit her right to the privileges of society in
Cranford.  I think she had some little idea of mortifying Lady Glenmire
by the decision she gave at last; which was to this effect: that whereas
a married woman takes her husband’s rank by the strict laws of
precedence, an unmarried woman retains the station her father occupied.
So Cranford was allowed to visit Miss Matty; and, whether allowed or not,
it intended to visit Lady Glenmire.

But what was our surprise—our dismay—when we learnt that Mr and _Mrs
Hoggins_ were returning on the following Tuesday!  Mrs Hoggins!  Had she
absolutely dropped her title, and so, in a spirit of bravado, cut the
aristocracy to become a Hoggins!  She, who might have been called Lady
Glenmire to her dying day!  Mrs Jamieson was pleased.  She said it only
convinced her of what she had known from the first, that the creature had
a low taste.  But “the creature” looked very happy on Sunday at church;
nor did we see it necessary to keep our veils down on that side of our
bonnets on which Mr and Mrs Hoggins sat, as Mrs Jamieson did; thereby
missing all the smiling glory of his face, and all the becoming blushes
of hers.  I am not sure if Martha and Jem looked more radiant in the
afternoon, when they, too, made their first appearance.  Mrs Jamieson
soothed the turbulence of her soul by having the blinds of her windows
drawn down, as if for a funeral, on the day when Mr and Mrs Hoggins
received callers; and it was with some difficulty that she was prevailed
upon to continue the _St James’s Chronicle_, so indignant was she with
its having inserted the announcement of the marriage.

           [Picture: Smiling glory . . . and becoming blushes]

Miss Matty’s sale went off famously.  She retained the furniture of her
sitting-room and bedroom; the former of which she was to occupy till
Martha could meet with a lodger who might wish to take it; and into this
sitting-room and bedroom she had to cram all sorts of things, which were
(the auctioneer assured her) bought in for her at the sale by an unknown
friend.  I always suspected Mrs Fitz-Adam of this; but she must have had
an accessory, who knew what articles were particularly regarded by Miss
Matty on account of their associations with her early days.  The rest of
the house looked rather bare, to be sure; all except one tiny bedroom, of
which my father allowed me to purchase the furniture for my occasional
use in case of Miss Matty’s illness.

I had expended my own small store in buying all manner of comfits and
lozenges, in order to tempt the little people whom Miss Matty loved so
much to come about her.  Tea in bright green canisters, and comfits in
tumblers—Miss Matty and I felt quite proud as we looked round us on the
evening before the shop was to be opened.  Martha had scoured the boarded
floor to a white cleanness, and it was adorned with a brilliant piece of
oil-cloth, on which customers were to stand before the table-counter.
The wholesome smell of plaster and whitewash pervaded the apartment.  A
very small “Matilda Jenkyns, licensed to sell tea,” was hidden under the
lintel of the new door, and two boxes of tea, with cabalistic
inscriptions all over them, stood ready to disgorge their contents into
the canisters.

Miss Matty, as I ought to have mentioned before, had had some scruples of
conscience at selling tea when there was already Mr Johnson in the town,
who included it among his numerous commodities; and, before she could
quite reconcile herself to the adoption of her new business, she had
trotted down to his shop, unknown to me, to tell him of the project that
was entertained, and to inquire if it was likely to injure his business.
My father called this idea of hers “great nonsense,” and “wondered how
tradespeople were to get on if there was to be a continual consulting of
each other’s interests, which would put a stop to all competition
directly.”  And, perhaps, it would not have done in Drumble, but in
Cranford it answered very well; for not only did Mr Johnson kindly put at
rest all Miss Matty’s scruples and fear of injuring his business, but I
have reason to know he repeatedly sent customers to her, saying that the
teas he kept were of a common kind, but that Miss Jenkyns had all the
choice sorts.  And expensive tea is a very favourite luxury with
well-to-do tradespeople and rich farmers’ wives, who turn up their noses
at the Congou and Souchong prevalent at many tables of gentility, and
will have nothing else than Gunpowder and Pekoe for themselves.

But to return to Miss Matty.  It was really very pleasant to see how her
unselfishness and simple sense of justice called out the same good
qualities in others.  She never seemed to think any one would impose upon
her, because she should be so grieved to do it to them.  I have heard her
put a stop to the asseverations of the man who brought her coals by
quietly saying, “I am sure you would be sorry to bring me wrong weight;”
and if the coals were short measure that time, I don’t believe they ever
were again.  People would have felt as much ashamed of presuming on her
good faith as they would have done on that of a child.  But my father
says “such simplicity might be very well in Cranford, but would never do
in the world.”  And I fancy the world must be very bad, for with all my
father’s suspicion of every one with whom he has dealings, and in spite
of all his many precautions, he lost upwards of a thousand pounds by
roguery only last year.

I just stayed long enough to establish Miss Matty in her new mode of
life, and to pack up the library, which the rector had purchased.  He had
written a very kind letter to Miss Matty, saying “how glad he should be
to take a library, so well selected as he knew that the late Mr Jenkyns’s
must have been, at any valuation put upon them.”  And when she agreed to
this, with a touch of sorrowful gladness that they would go back to the
rectory and be arranged on the accustomed walls once more, he sent word
that he feared that he had not room for them all, and perhaps Miss Matty
would kindly allow him to leave some volumes on her shelves.  But Miss
Matty said that she had her Bible and “Johnson’s Dictionary,” and should
not have much time for reading, she was afraid; still, I retained a few
books out of consideration for the rector’s kindness.

The money which he had paid, and that produced by the sale, was partly
expended in the stock of tea, and part of it was invested against a rainy
day—_i.e._ old age or illness.  It was but a small sum, it is true; and
it occasioned a few evasions of truth and white lies (all of which I
think very wrong indeed—in theory—and would rather not put them in
practice), for we knew Miss Matty would be perplexed as to her duty if
she were aware of any little reserve-fund being made for her while the
debts of the bank remained unpaid.  Moreover, she had never been told of
the way in which her friends were contributing to pay the rent.  I should
have liked to tell her this, but the mystery of the affair gave a
piquancy to their deed of kindness which the ladies were unwilling to
give up; and at first Martha had to shirk many a perplexed question as to
her ways and means of living in such a house, but by-and-by Miss Matty’s
prudent uneasiness sank down into acquiescence with the existing
arrangement.

I left Miss Matty with a good heart.  Her sales of tea during the first
two days had surpassed my most sanguine expectations.  The whole country
round seemed to be all out of tea at once.  The only alteration I could
have desired in Miss Matty’s way of doing business was, that she should
not have so plaintively entreated some of her customers not to buy green
tea—running it down as a slow poison, sure to destroy the nerves, and
produce all manner of evil.  Their pertinacity in taking it, in spite of
all her warnings, distressed her so much that I really thought she would
relinquish the sale of it, and so lose half her custom; and I was driven
to my wits’ end for instances of longevity entirely attributable to a
persevering use of green tea.  But the final argument, which settled the
question, was a happy reference of mine to the train-oil and tallow
candles which the Esquimaux not only enjoy but digest.  After that she
acknowledged that “one man’s meat might be another man’s poison,” and
contented herself thence-forward with an occasional remonstrance when she
thought the purchaser was too young and innocent to be acquainted with
the evil effects green tea produced on some constitutions, and an
habitual sigh when people old enough to choose more wisely would prefer
it.

I went over from Drumble once a quarter at least to settle the accounts,
and see after the necessary business letters.  And, speaking of letters,
I began to be very much ashamed of remembering my letter to the Aga
Jenkyns, and very glad I had never named my writing to any one.  I only
hoped the letter was lost.  No answer came.  No sign was made.

About a year after Miss Matty set up shop, I received one of Martha’s
hieroglyphics, begging me to come to Cranford very soon.  I was afraid
that Miss Matty was ill, and went off that very afternoon, and took
Martha by surprise when she saw me on opening the door.  We went into the
kitchen as usual, to have our confidential conference, and then Martha
told me she was expecting her confinement very soon—in a week or two; and
she did not think Miss Matty was aware of it, and she wanted me to break
the news to her, “for indeed, miss,” continued Martha, crying
hysterically, “I’m afraid she won’t approve of it, and I’m sure I don’t
know who is to take care of her as she should be taken care of when I am
laid up.”

I comforted Martha by telling her I would remain till she was about
again, and only wished she had told me her reason for this sudden
summons, as then I would have brought the requisite stock of clothes.
But Martha was so tearful and tender-spirited, and unlike her usual self,
that I said as little as possible about myself, and endeavoured rather to
comfort Martha under all the probable and possible misfortunes which came
crowding upon her imagination.

I then stole out of the house-door, and made my appearance as if I were a
customer in the shop, just to take Miss Matty by surprise, and gain an
idea of how she looked in her new situation.  It was warm May weather, so
only the little half-door was closed; and Miss Matty sat behind the
counter, knitting an elaborate pair of garters; elaborate they seemed to
me, but the difficult stitch was no weight upon her mind, for she was
singing in a low voice to herself as her needles went rapidly in and out.
I call it singing, but I dare say a musician would not use that word to
the tuneless yet sweet humming of the low worn voice.  I found out from
the words, far more than from the attempt at the tune, that it was the
Old Hundredth she was crooning to herself; but the quiet continuous sound
told of content, and gave me a pleasant feeling, as I stood in the street
just outside the door, quite in harmony with that soft May morning.  I
went in.  At first she did not catch who it was, and stood up as if to
serve me; but in another minute watchful pussy had clutched her knitting,
which was dropped in eager joy at seeing me.  I found, after we had had a
little conversation, that it was as Martha said, and that Miss Matty had
no idea of the approaching household event.  So I thought I would let
things take their course, secure that when I went to her with the baby in
my arms, I should obtain that forgiveness for Martha which she was
needlessly frightening herself into believing that Miss Matty would
withhold, under some notion that the new claimant would require
attentions from its mother that it would be faithless treason to Miss
Matty to render.

But I was right.  I think that must be an hereditary quality, for my
father says he is scarcely ever wrong.  One morning, within a week after
I arrived, I went to call Miss Matty, with a little bundle of flannel in
my arms.  She was very much awe-struck when I showed her what it was, and
asked for her spectacles off the dressing-table, and looked at it
curiously, with a sort of tender wonder at its small perfection of parts.
She could not banish the thought of the surprise all day, but went about
on tiptoe, and was very silent.  But she stole up to see Martha and they
both cried with joy, and she got into a complimentary speech to Jem, and
did not know how to get out of it again, and was only extricated from her
dilemma by the sound of the shop-bell, which was an equal relief to the
shy, proud, honest Jem, who shook my hand so vigorously when I
congratulated him, that I think I feel the pain of it yet.

                   [Picture: I went to call Miss Matty]

I had a busy life while Martha was laid up.  I attended on Miss Matty,
and prepared her meals; I cast up her accounts, and examined into the
state of her canisters and tumblers.  I helped her, too, occasionally, in
the shop; and it gave me no small amusement, and sometimes a little
uneasiness, to watch her ways there.  If a little child came in to ask
for an ounce of almond-comfits (and four of the large kind which Miss
Matty sold weighed that much), she always added one more by “way of
make-weight,” as she called it, although the scale was handsomely turned
before; and when I remonstrated against this, her reply was, “The little
things like it so much!”  There was no use in telling her that the fifth
comfit weighed a quarter of an ounce, and made every sale into a loss to
her pocket.  So I remembered the green tea, and winged my shaft with a
feather out of her own plumage.  I told her how unwholesome
almond-comfits were, and how ill excess in them might make the little
children.  This argument produced some effect; for, henceforward, instead
of the fifth comfit, she always told them to hold out their tiny palms,
into which she shook either peppermint or ginger lozenges, as a
preventive to the dangers that might arise from the previous sale.
Altogether the lozenge trade, conducted on these principles, did not
promise to be remunerative; but I was happy to find she had made more
than twenty pounds during the last year by her sales of tea; and,
moreover, that now she was accustomed to it, she did not dislike the
employment, which brought her into kindly intercourse with many of the
people round about.  If she gave them good weight, they, in their turn,
brought many a little country present to the “old rector’s daughter”; a
cream cheese, a few new-laid eggs, a little fresh ripe fruit, a bunch of
flowers.  The counter was quite loaded with these offerings sometimes, as
she told me.

As for Cranford in general, it was going on much as usual.  The Jamieson
and Hoggins feud still raged, if a feud it could be called, when only one
side cared much about it.  Mr and Mrs Hoggins were very happy together,
and, like most very happy people, quite ready to be friendly; indeed, Mrs
Hoggins was really desirous to be restored to Mrs Jamieson’s good graces,
because of the former intimacy.  But Mrs Jamieson considered their very
happiness an insult to the Glenmire family, to which she had still the
honour to belong, and she doggedly refused and rejected every advance.
Mr Mulliner, like a faithful clansman, espoused his mistress’ side with
ardour.  If he saw either Mr or Mrs Hoggins, he would cross the street,
and appear absorbed in the contemplation of life in general, and his own
path in particular, until he had passed them by.  Miss Pole used to amuse
herself with wondering what in the world Mrs Jamieson would do, if either
she, or Mr Mulliner, or any other member of her household was taken ill;
she could hardly have the face to call in Mr Hoggins after the way she
had behaved to them.  Miss Pole grew quite impatient for some
indisposition or accident to befall Mrs Jamieson or her dependents, in
order that Cranford might see how she would act under the perplexing
circumstances.

Martha was beginning to go about again, and I had already fixed a limit,
not very far distant, to my visit, when one afternoon, as I was sitting
in the shop-parlour with Miss Matty—I remember the weather was colder now
than it had been in May, three weeks before, and we had a fire and kept
the door fully closed—we saw a gentleman go slowly past the window, and
then stand opposite to the door, as if looking out for the name which we
had so carefully hidden.  He took out a double eyeglass and peered about
for some time before he could discover it.  Then he came in.  And, all on
a sudden, it flashed across me that it was the Aga himself!  For his
clothes had an out-of-the-way foreign cut about them, and his face was
deep brown, as if tanned and re-tanned by the sun.  His complexion
contrasted oddly with his plentiful snow-white hair, his eyes were dark
and piercing, and he had an odd way of contracting them and puckering up
his cheeks into innumerable wrinkles when he looked earnestly at objects.
He did so to Miss Matty when he first came in.  His glance had first
caught and lingered a little upon me, but then turned, with the peculiar
searching look I have described, to Miss Matty.  She was a little
fluttered and nervous, but no more so than she always was when any man
came into her shop.  She thought that he would probably have a note, or a
sovereign at least, for which she would have to give change, which was an
operation she very much disliked to perform.  But the present customer
stood opposite to her, without asking for anything, only looking fixedly
at her as he drummed upon the table with his fingers, just for all the
world as Miss Jenkyns used to do.  Miss Matty was on the point of asking
him what he wanted (as she told me afterwards), when he turned sharp to
me: “Is your name Mary Smith?”

“Yes!” said I.

All my doubts as to his identity were set at rest, and I only wondered
what he would say or do next, and how Miss Matty would stand the joyful
shock of what he had to reveal.  Apparently he was at a loss how to
announce himself, for he looked round at last in search of something to
buy, so as to gain time, and, as it happened, his eye caught on the
almond-comfits, and he boldly asked for a pound of “those things.”  I
doubt if Miss Matty had a whole pound in the shop, and, besides the
unusual magnitude of the order, she was distressed with the idea of the
indigestion they would produce, taken in such unlimited quantities.  She
looked up to remonstrate.  Something of tender relaxation in his face
struck home to her heart.  She said, “It is—oh, sir! can you be Peter?”
and trembled from head to foot.  In a moment he was round the table and
had her in his arms, sobbing the tearless cries of old age.  I brought
her a glass of wine, for indeed her colour had changed so as to alarm me
and Mr Peter too.  He kept saying, “I have been too sudden for you,
Matty—I have, my little girl.”

I proposed that she should go at once up into the drawing-room and lie
down on the sofa there.  She looked wistfully at her brother, whose hand
she had held tight, even when nearly fainting; but on his assuring her
that he would not leave her, she allowed him to carry her upstairs.

I thought that the best I could do was to run and put the kettle on the
fire for early tea, and then to attend to the shop, leaving the brother
and sister to exchange some of the many thousand things they must have to
say.  I had also to break the news to Martha, who received it with a
burst of tears which nearly infected me.  She kept recovering herself to
ask if I was sure it was indeed Miss Matty’s brother, for I had mentioned
that he had grey hair, and she had always heard that he was a very
handsome young man.  Something of the same kind perplexed Miss Matty at
tea-time, when she was installed in the great easy-chair opposite to Mr
Jenkyns in order to gaze her fill.  She could hardly drink for looking at
him, and as for eating, that was out of the question.

“I suppose hot climates age people very quickly,” said she, almost to
herself.  “When you left Cranford you had not a grey hair in your head.”

“But how many years ago is that?” said Mr Peter, smiling.

“Ah, true! yes, I suppose you and I are getting old.  But still I did not
think we were so very old!  But white hair is very becoming to you,
Peter,” she continued—a little afraid lest she had hurt him by revealing
how his appearance had impressed her.

“I suppose I forgot dates too, Matty, for what do you think I have
brought for you from India?  I have an Indian muslin gown and a pearl
necklace for you somewhere in my chest at Portsmouth.”  He smiled as if
amused at the idea of the incongruity of his presents with the appearance
of his sister; but this did not strike her all at once, while the
elegance of the articles did.  I could see that for a moment her
imagination dwelt complacently on the idea of herself thus attired; and
instinctively she put her hand up to her throat—that little delicate
throat which (as Miss Pole had told me) had been one of her youthful
charms; but the hand met the touch of folds of soft muslin in which she
was always swathed up to her chin, and the sensation recalled a sense of
the unsuitableness of a pearl necklace to her age.  She said, “I’m afraid
I’m too old; but it was very kind of you to think of it.  They are just
what I should have liked years ago—when I was young.”

“So I thought, my little Matty.  I remembered your tastes; they were so
like my dear mother’s.”  At the mention of that name the brother and
sister clasped each other’s hands yet more fondly, and, although they
were perfectly silent, I fancied they might have something to say if they
were unchecked by my presence, and I got up to arrange my room for Mr
Peter’s occupation that night, intending myself to share Miss Matty’s
bed.  But at my movement, he started up.  “I must go and settle about a
room at the ‘George.’  My carpet-bag is there too.”

“No!” said Miss Matty, in great distress—“you must not go; please, dear
Peter—pray, Mary—oh! you must not go!”

She was so much agitated that we both promised everything she wished.
Peter sat down again and gave her his hand, which for better security she
held in both of hers, and I left the room to accomplish my arrangements.

Long, long into the night, far, far into the morning, did Miss Matty and
I talk.  She had much to tell me of her brother’s life and adventures,
which he had communicated to her as they had sat alone.  She said all was
thoroughly clear to her; but I never quite understood the whole story;
and when in after days I lost my awe of Mr Peter enough to question him
myself, he laughed at my curiosity, and told me stories that sounded so
very much like Baron Munchausen’s, that I was sure he was making fun of
me.  What I heard from Miss Matty was that he had been a volunteer at the
siege of Rangoon; had been taken prisoner by the Burmese; and somehow
obtained favour and eventual freedom from knowing how to bleed the chief
of the small tribe in some case of dangerous illness; that on his release
from years of captivity he had had his letters returned from England with
the ominous word “Dead” marked upon them; and, believing himself to be
the last of his race, he had settled down as an indigo planter, and had
proposed to spend the remainder of his life in the country to whose
inhabitants and modes of life he had become habituated, when my letter
had reached him; and, with the odd vehemence which characterised him in
age as it had done in youth, he had sold his land and all his possessions
to the first purchaser, and come home to the poor old sister, who was
more glad and rich than any princess when she looked at him.  She talked
me to sleep at last, and then I was awakened by a slight sound at the
door, for which she begged my pardon as she crept penitently into bed;
but it seems that when I could no longer confirm her belief that the
long-lost was really here—under the same roof—she had begun to fear lest
it was only a waking dream of hers; that there never had been a Peter
sitting by her all that blessed evening—but that the real Peter lay dead
far away beneath some wild sea-wave, or under some strange eastern tree.
And so strong had this nervous feeling of hers become, that she was fain
to get up and go and convince herself that he was really there by
listening through the door to his even, regular breathing—I don’t like to
call it snoring, but I heard it myself through two closed doors—and
by-and-by it soothed Miss Matty to sleep.

I don’t believe Mr Peter came home from India as rich as a nabob; he even
considered himself poor, but neither he nor Miss Matty cared much about
that.  At any rate, he had enough to live upon “very genteelly” at
Cranford; he and Miss Matty together.  And a day or two after his
arrival, the shop was closed, while troops of little urchins gleefully
awaited the shower of comfits and lozenges that came from time to time
down upon their faces as they stood up-gazing at Miss Matty’s
drawing-room windows.  Occasionally Miss Matty would say to them
(half-hidden behind the curtains), “My dear children, don’t make
yourselves ill;” but a strong arm pulled her back, and a more rattling
shower than ever succeeded.  A part of the tea was sent in presents to
the Cranford ladies; and some of it was distributed among the old people
who remembered Mr Peter in the days of his frolicsome youth.  The Indian
muslin gown was reserved for darling Flora Gordon (Miss Jessie Brown’s
daughter).  The Gordons had been on the Continent for the last few years,
but were now expected to return very soon; and Miss Matty, in her
sisterly pride, anticipated great delight in the joy of showing them Mr
Peter.  The pearl necklace disappeared; and about that time many handsome
and useful presents made their appearance in the households of Miss Pole
and Mrs Forrester; and some rare and delicate Indian ornaments graced the
drawing-rooms of Mrs Jamieson and Mrs Fitz-Adam.  I myself was not
forgotten.  Among other things, I had the handsomest-bound and best
edition of Dr Johnson’s works that could be procured; and dear Miss
Matty, with tears in her eyes, begged me to consider it as a present from
her sister as well as herself.  In short, no one was forgotten; and, what
was more, every one, however insignificant, who had shown kindness to
Miss Matty at any time, was sure of Mr Peter’s cordial regard.




CHAPTER XVI—PEACE TO CRANFORD


IT was not surprising that Mr Peter became such a favourite at Cranford.
The ladies vied with each other who should admire him most; and no
wonder, for their quiet lives were astonishingly stirred up by the
arrival from India—especially as the person arrived told more wonderful
stories than Sindbad the Sailor; and, as Miss Pole said, was quite as
good as an Arabian Night any evening.  For my own part, I had vibrated
all my life between Drumble and Cranford, and I thought it was quite
possible that all Mr Peter’s stories might be true, although wonderful;
but when I found that, if we swallowed an anecdote of tolerable magnitude
one week, we had the dose considerably increased the next, I began to
have my doubts; especially as I noticed that when his sister was present
the accounts of Indian life were comparatively tame; not that she knew
more than we did, perhaps less.  I noticed also that when the rector came
to call, Mr Peter talked in a different way about the countries he had
been in.  But I don’t think the ladies in Cranford would have considered
him such a wonderful traveller if they had only heard him talk in the
quiet way he did to him.  They liked him the better, indeed, for being
what they called “so very Oriental.”

One day, at a select party in his honour, which Miss Pole gave, and from
which, as Mrs Jamieson honoured it with her presence, and had even
offered to send Mr Mulliner to wait, Mr and Mrs Hoggins and Mrs Fitz-Adam
were necessarily excluded—one day at Miss Pole’s, Mr Peter said he was
tired of sitting upright against the hard-backed uneasy chairs, and asked
if he might not indulge himself in sitting cross-legged.  Miss Pole’s
consent was eagerly given, and down he went with the utmost gravity.  But
when Miss Pole asked me, in an audible whisper, “if he did not remind me
of the Father of the Faithful?” I could not help thinking of poor Simon
Jones, the lame tailor, and while Mrs Jamieson slowly commented on the
elegance and convenience of the attitude, I remembered how we had all
followed that lady’s lead in condemning Mr Hoggins for vulgarity because
he simply crossed his legs as he sat still on his chair.  Many of Mr
Peter’s ways of eating were a little strange amongst such ladies as Miss
Pole, and Miss Matty, and Mrs Jamieson, especially when I recollected the
untasted green peas and two-pronged forks at poor Mr Holbrook’s dinner.

The mention of that gentleman’s name recalls to my mind a conversation
between Mr Peter and Miss Matty one evening in the summer after he
returned to Cranford.  The day had been very hot, and Miss Matty had been
much oppressed by the weather, in the heat of which her brother revelled.
I remember that she had been unable to nurse Martha’s baby, which had
become her favourite employment of late, and which was as much at home in
her arms as in its mother’s, as long as it remained a light-weight,
portable by one so fragile as Miss Matty.  This day to which I refer,
Miss Matty had seemed more than usually feeble and languid, and only
revived when the sun went down, and her sofa was wheeled to the open
window, through which, although it looked into the principal street of
Cranford, the fragrant smell of the neighbouring hayfields came in every
now and then, borne by the soft breezes that stirred the dull air of the
summer twilight, and then died away.  The silence of the sultry
atmosphere was lost in the murmuring noises which came in from many an
open window and door; even the children were abroad in the street, late
as it was (between ten and eleven), enjoying the game of play for which
they had not had spirits during the heat of the day.  It was a source of
satisfaction to Miss Matty to see how few candles were lighted, even in
the apartments of those houses from which issued the greatest signs of
life.  Mr Peter, Miss Matty, and I had all been quiet, each with a
separate reverie, for some little time, when Mr Peter broke in—

“Do you know, little Matty, I could have sworn you were on the high road
to matrimony when I left England that last time!  If anybody had told me
you would have lived and died an old maid then, I should have laughed in
their faces.”

Miss Matty made no reply, and I tried in vain to think of some subject
which should effectually turn the conversation; but I was very stupid;
and before I spoke he went on—

“It was Holbrook, that fine manly fellow who lived at Woodley, that I
used to think would carry off my little Matty.  You would not think it
now, I dare say, Mary; but this sister of mine was once a very pretty
girl—at least, I thought so, and so I’ve a notion did poor Holbrook.
What business had he to die before I came home to thank him for all his
kindness to a good-for-nothing cub as I was?  It was that that made me
first think he cared for you; for in all our fishing expeditions it was
Matty, Matty, we talked about.  Poor Deborah!  What a lecture she read me
on having asked him home to lunch one day, when she had seen the Arley
carriage in the town, and thought that my lady might call.  Well, that’s
long years ago; more than half a life-time, and yet it seems like
yesterday!  I don’t know a fellow I should have liked better as a
brother-in-law.  You must have played your cards badly, my little Matty,
somehow or another—wanted your brother to be a good go-between, eh,
little one?” said he, putting out his hand to take hold of hers as she
lay on the sofa.  “Why, what’s this? you’re shivering and shaking, Matty,
with that confounded open window.  Shut it, Mary, this minute!”

I did so, and then stooped down to kiss Miss Matty, and see if she really
were chilled.  She caught at my hand, and gave it a hard squeeze—but
unconsciously, I think—for in a minute or two she spoke to us quite in
her usual voice, and smiled our uneasiness away, although she patiently
submitted to the prescriptions we enforced of a warm bed and a glass of
weak negus.  I was to leave Cranford the next day, and before I went I
saw that all the effects of the open window had quite vanished.  I had
superintended most of the alterations necessary in the house and
household during the latter weeks of my stay.  The shop was once more a
parlour: the empty resounding rooms again furnished up to the very
garrets.

There had been some talk of establishing Martha and Jem in another house,
but Miss Matty would not hear of this.  Indeed, I never saw her so much
roused as when Miss Pole had assumed it to be the most desirable
arrangement.  As long as Martha would remain with Miss Matty, Miss Matty
was only too thankful to have her about her; yes, and Jem too, who was a
very pleasant man to have in the house, for she never saw him from week’s
end to week’s end.  And as for the probable children, if they would all
turn out such little darlings as her god-daughter, Matilda, she should
not mind the number, if Martha didn’t.  Besides, the next was to be
called Deborah—a point which Miss Matty had reluctantly yielded to
Martha’s stubborn determination that her first-born was to be Matilda.
So Miss Pole had to lower her colours, and even her voice, as she said to
me that, as Mr and Mrs Hearn were still to go on living in the same house
with Miss Matty, we had certainly done a wise thing in hiring Martha’s
niece as an auxiliary.

I left Miss Matty and Mr Peter most comfortable and contented; the only
subject for regret to the tender heart of the one, and the social
friendly nature of the other, being the unfortunate quarrel between Mrs
Jamieson and the plebeian Hogginses and their following.  In joke, I
prophesied one day that this would only last until Mrs Jamieson or Mr
Mulliner were ill, in which case they would only be too glad to be
friends with Mr Hoggins; but Miss Matty did not like my looking forward
to anything like illness in so light a manner, and before the year was
out all had come round in a far more satisfactory way.

I received two Cranford letters on one auspicious October morning.  Both
Miss Pole and Miss Matty wrote to ask me to come over and meet the
Gordons, who had returned to England alive and well with their two
children, now almost grown up.  Dear Jessie Brown had kept her old kind
nature, although she had changed her name and station; and she wrote to
say that she and Major Gordon expected to be in Cranford on the
fourteenth, and she hoped and begged to be remembered to Mrs Jamieson
(named first, as became her honourable station), Miss Pole and Miss
Matty—could she ever forget their kindness to her poor father and
sister?—Mrs Forrester, Mr Hoggins (and here again came in an allusion to
kindness shown to the dead long ago), his new wife, who as such must
allow Mrs Gordon to desire to make her acquaintance, and who was,
moreover, an old Scotch friend of her husband’s.  In short, every one was
named, from the rector—who had been appointed to Cranford in the interim
between Captain Brown’s death and Miss Jessie’s marriage, and was now
associated with the latter event—down to Miss Betty Barker.  All were
asked to the luncheon; all except Mrs Fitz-Adam, who had come to live in
Cranford since Miss Jessie Brown’s days, and whom I found rather moping
on account of the omission.  People wondered at Miss Betty Barker’s being
included in the honourable list; but, then, as Miss Pole said, we must
remember the disregard of the genteel proprieties of life in which the
poor captain had educated his girls, and for his sake we swallowed our
pride.  Indeed, Mrs Jamieson rather took it as a compliment, as putting
Miss Betty (formerly _her_ maid) on a level with “those Hogginses.”

But when I arrived in Cranford, nothing was as yet ascertained of Mrs
Jamieson’s own intentions; would the honourable lady go, or would she
not?  Mr Peter declared that she should and she would; Miss Pole shook
her head and desponded.  But Mr Peter was a man of resources.  In the
first place, he persuaded Miss Matty to write to Mrs Gordon, and to tell
her of Mrs Fitz-Adam’s existence, and to beg that one so kind, and
cordial, and generous, might be included in the pleasant invitation.  An
answer came back by return of post, with a pretty little note for Mrs
Fitz-Adam, and a request that Miss Matty would deliver it herself and
explain the previous omission.  Mrs Fitz-Adam was as pleased as could be,
and thanked Miss Matty over and over again.  Mr Peter had said, “Leave
Mrs Jamieson to me;” so we did; especially as we knew nothing that we
could do to alter her determination if once formed.

I did not know, nor did Miss Matty, how things were going on, until Miss
Pole asked me, just the day before Mrs Gordon came, if I thought there
was anything between Mr Peter and Mrs Jamieson in the matrimonial line,
for that Mrs Jamieson was really going to the lunch at the “George.”  She
had sent Mr Mulliner down to desire that there might be a footstool put
to the warmest seat in the room, as she meant to come, and knew that
their chairs were very high.  Miss Pole had picked this piece of news up,
and from it she conjectured all sorts of things, and bemoaned yet more.
“If Peter should marry, what would become of poor dear Miss Matty?  And
Mrs Jamieson, of all people!”  Miss Pole seemed to think there were other
ladies in Cranford who would have done more credit to his choice, and I
think she must have had someone who was unmarried in her head, for she
kept saying, “It was so wanting in delicacy in a widow to think of such a
thing.”

When I got back to Miss Matty’s I really did begin to think that Mr Peter
might be thinking of Mrs Jamieson for a wife, and I was as unhappy as
Miss Pole about it.  He had the proof sheet of a great placard in his
hand.  “Signor Brunoni, Magician to the King of Delhi, the Rajah of Oude,
and the great Lama of Thibet,” &c. &c., was going to “perform in Cranford
for one night only,” the very next night; and Miss Matty, exultant,
showed me a letter from the Gordons, promising to remain over this
gaiety, which Miss Matty said was entirely Peter’s doing.  He had written
to ask the signor to come, and was to be at all the expenses of the
affair.  Tickets were to be sent gratis to as many as the room would
hold.  In short, Miss Matty was charmed with the plan, and said that
to-morrow Cranford would remind her of the Preston Guild, to which she
had been in her youth—a luncheon at the “George,” with the dear Gordons,
and the signor in the Assembly Room in the evening.  But I—I looked only
at the fatal words:—

    “_Under the Patronage of the_ HONOURABLE MRS JAMIESON.”

She, then, was chosen to preside over this entertainment of Mr Peter’s;
she was perhaps going to displace my dear Miss Matty in his heart, and
make her life lonely once more!  I could not look forward to the morrow
with any pleasure; and every innocent anticipation of Miss Matty’s only
served to add to my annoyance.

So, angry and irritated, and exaggerating every little incident which
could add to my irritation, I went on till we were all assembled in the
great parlour at the “George.”  Major and Mrs Gordon and pretty Flora and
Mr Ludovic were all as bright and handsome and friendly as could be; but
I could hardly attend to them for watching Mr Peter, and I saw that Miss
Pole was equally busy.  I had never seen Mrs Jamieson so roused and
animated before; her face looked full of interest in what Mr Peter was
saying.  I drew near to listen.  My relief was great when I caught that
his words were not words of love, but that, for all his grave face, he
was at his old tricks.  He was telling her of his travels in India, and
describing the wonderful height of the Himalaya mountains: one touch
after another added to their size, and each exceeded the former in
absurdity; but Mrs Jamieson really enjoyed all in perfect good faith.  I
suppose she required strong stimulants to excite her to come out of her
apathy.  Mr Peter wound up his account by saying that, of course, at that
altitude there were none of the animals to be found that existed in the
lower regions; the game,—everything was different.  Firing one day at
some flying creature, he was very much dismayed when it fell, to find
that he had shot a cherubim!  Mr Peter caught my eye at this moment, and
gave me such a funny twinkle, that I felt sure he had no thoughts of Mrs
Jamieson as a wife from that time.  She looked uncomfortably amazed—

“But, Mr Peter, shooting a cherubim—don’t you think—I am afraid that was
sacrilege!”

Mr Peter composed his countenance in a moment, and appeared shocked at
the idea, which, as he said truly enough, was now presented to him for
the first time; but then Mrs Jamieson must remember that he had been
living for a long time among savages—all of whom were heathens—some of
them, he was afraid, were downright Dissenters.  Then, seeing Miss Matty
draw near, he hastily changed the conversation, and after a little while,
turning to me, he said, “Don’t be shocked, prim little Mary, at all my
wonderful stories.  I consider Mrs Jamieson fair game, and besides I am
bent on propitiating her, and the first step towards it is keeping her
well awake.  I bribed her here by asking her to let me have her name as
patroness for my poor conjuror this evening; and I don’t want to give her
time enough to get up her rancour against the Hogginses, who are just
coming in.  I want everybody to be friends, for it harasses Matty so much
to hear of these quarrels.  I shall go at it again by-and-by, so you need
not look shocked.  I intend to enter the Assembly Room to-night with Mrs
Jamieson on one side, and my lady, Mrs Hoggins, on the other.  You see if
I don’t.”

Somehow or another he did; and fairly got them into conversation
together.  Major and Mrs Gordon helped at the good work with their
perfect ignorance of any existing coolness between any of the inhabitants
of Cranford.

Ever since that day there has been the old friendly sociability in
Cranford society; which I am thankful for, because of my dear Miss
Matty’s love of peace and kindliness.  We all love Miss Matty, and I
somehow think we are all of us better when she is near us.

CHAPTER I

'HASTE TO THE WEDDING'

    'Wooed and married and a'.'


'Edith!' said Margaret, gently, 'Edith!'

But, as Margaret half suspected, Edith had fallen asleep. She lay curled
up on the sofa in the back drawing-room in Harley Street, looking very
lovely in her white muslin and blue ribbons. If Titania had ever been
dressed in white muslin and blue ribbons, and had fallen asleep on a
crimson damask sofa in a back drawing-room, Edith might have been taken
for her. Margaret was struck afresh by her cousin's beauty. They had
grown up together from childhood, and all along Edith had been remarked
upon by every one, except Margaret, for her prettiness; but Margaret had
never thought about it until the last few days, when the prospect of
soon losing her companion seemed to give force to every sweet quality
and charm which Edith possessed. They had been talking about wedding
dresses, and wedding ceremonies; and Captain Lennox, and what he had
told Edith about her future life at Corfu, where his regiment was
stationed; and the difficulty of keeping a piano in good tune (a
difficulty which Edith seemed to consider as one of the most formidable
that could befall her in her married life), and what gowns she should
want in the visits to Scotland, which would immediately succeed her
marriage; but the whispered tone had latterly become more drowsy; and
Margaret, after a pause of a few minutes, found, as she fancied, that in
spite of the buzz in the next room, Edith had rolled herself up into a
soft ball of muslin and ribbon, and silken curls, and gone off into a
peaceful little after-dinner nap.

Margaret had been on the point of telling her cousin of some of the
plans and visions which she entertained as to her future life in the
country parsonage, where her father and mother lived; and where her
bright holidays had always been passed, though for the last ten years
her aunt Shaw's house had been considered as her home. But in default of
a listener, she had to brood over the change in her life silently as
heretofore. It was a happy brooding, although tinged with regret at
being separated for an indefinite time from her gentle aunt and dear
cousin. As she thought of the delight of filling the important post of
only daughter in Helstone parsonage, pieces of the conversation out of
the next room came upon her ears. Her aunt Shaw was talking to the five
or six ladies who had been dining there, and whose husbands were still
in the dining-room. They were the familiar acquaintances of the house;
neighbours whom Mrs. Shaw called friends, because she happened to dine
with them more frequently than with any other people, and because if she
or Edith wanted anything from them, or they from her, they did not
scruple to make a call at each other's houses before luncheon. These
ladies and their husbands were invited, in their capacity of friends, to
eat a farewell dinner in honour of Edith's approaching marriage. Edith
had rather objected to this arrangement, for Captain Lennox was expected
to arrive by a late train this very evening; but, although she was a
spoiled child, she was too careless and idle to have a very strong will
of her own, and gave way when she found that her mother had absolutely
ordered those extra delicacies of the season which are always supposed
to be efficacious against immoderate grief at farewell dinners. She
contented herself by leaning back in her chair, merely playing with the
food on her plate, and looking grave and absent; while all around her
were enjoying the mots of Mr. Grey, the gentleman who always took the
bottom of the table at Mrs. Shaw's dinner parties, and asked Edith to
give them some music in the drawing-room. Mr. Grey was particularly
agreeable over this farewell dinner, and the gentlemen staid down stairs
longer than usual. It was very well they did--to judge from the
fragments of conversation which Margaret overheard.

'I suffered too much myself; not that I was not extremely happy with the
poor dear General, but still disparity of age is a drawback; one that I
was resolved Edith should not have to encounter. Of course, without any
maternal partiality, I foresaw that the dear child was likely to marry
early; indeed, I had often said that I was sure she would be married
before she was nineteen. I had quite a prophetic feeling when Captain
Lennox'--and here the voice dropped into a whisper, but Margaret could
easily supply the blank. The course of true love in Edith's case had run
remarkably smooth. Mrs. Shaw had given way to the presentiment, as she
expressed it; and had rather urged on the marriage, although it was
below the expectations which many of Edith's acquaintances had formed
for her, a young and pretty heiress. But Mrs. Shaw said that her only
child should marry for love,--and sighed emphatically, as if love had
not been her motive for marrying the General. Mrs. Shaw enjoyed the
romance of the present engagement rather more than her daughter. Not but
that Edith was very thoroughly and properly in love; still she would
certainly have preferred a good house in Belgravia, to all the
picturesqueness of the life which Captain Lennox described at Corfu. The
very parts which made Margaret glow as she listened, Edith pretended to
shiver and shudder at; partly for the pleasure she had in being coaxed
out of her dislike by her fond lover, and partly because anything of a
gipsy or make-shift life was really distasteful to her. Yet had any one
come with a fine house, and a fine estate, and a fine title to boot,
Edith would still have clung to Captain Lennox while the temptation
lasted; when it was over, it is possible she might have had little
qualms of ill-concealed regret that Captain Lennox could not have united
in his person everything that was desirable. In this she was but her
mother's child; who, after deliberately marrying General Shaw with no
warmer feeling than respect for his character and establishment, was
constantly, though quietly, bemoaning her hard lot in being united to
one whom she could not love.

'I have spared no expense in her trousseau,' were the next words
Margaret heard.

'She has all the beautiful Indian shawls and scarfs the General gave to
me, but which I shall never wear again.'

'She is a lucky girl,' replied another voice, which Margaret knew to be
that of Mrs. Gibson, a lady who was taking a double interest in the
conversation, from the fact of one of her daughters having been married
within the last few weeks.

'Helen had set her heart upon an Indian shawl, but really when I found
what an extravagant price was asked, I was obliged to refuse her. She
will be quite envious when she hears of Edith having Indian shawls. What
kind are they? Delhi? with the lovely little borders?'

Margaret heard her aunt's voice again, but this time it was as if she
had raised herself up from her half-recumbent position, and were looking
into the more dimly lighted back drawing-room. 'Edith! Edith!' cried
she; and then she sank as if wearied by the exertion. Margaret stepped
forward.

'Edith is asleep, Aunt Shaw. Is it anything I can do?'

All the ladies said 'Poor child!' on receiving this distressing
intelligence about Edith; and the minute lap-dog in Mrs. Shaw's arms
began to bark, as if excited by the burst of pity.

'Hush, Tiny! you naughty little girl! you will waken your mistress. It
was only to ask Edith if she would tell Newton to bring down her shawls:
perhaps you would go, Margaret dear?'

Margaret went up into the old nursery at the very top of the house,
where Newton was busy getting up some laces which were required for the
wedding. While Newton went (not without a muttered grumbling) to undo
the shawls, which had already been exhibited four or five times that
day, Margaret looked round upon the nursery; the first room in that
house with which she had become familiar nine years ago, when she was
brought, all untamed from the forest, to share the home, the play, and
the lessons of her cousin Edith. She remembered the dark, dim look of
the London nursery, presided over by an austere and ceremonious nurse,
who was terribly particular about clean hands and torn frocks. She
recollected the first tea up there--separate from her father and aunt,
who were dining somewhere down below an infinite depth of stairs; for
unless she were up in the sky (the child thought), they must be deep
down in the bowels of the earth. At home--before she came to live in
Harley Street--her mother's dressing-room had been her nursery; and, as
they kept early hours in the country parsonage, Margaret had always had
her meals with her father and mother. Oh! well did the tall stately girl
of eighteen remember the tears shed with such wild passion of grief by
the little girl of nine, as she hid her face under the bed-clothes, in
that first night; and how she was bidden not to cry by the nurse,
because it would disturb Miss Edith; and how she had cried as bitterly,
but more quietly, till her newly-seen, grand, pretty aunt had come
softly upstairs with Mr. Hale to show him his little sleeping daughter.
Then the little Margaret had hushed her sobs, and tried to lie quiet as
if asleep, for fear of making her father unhappy by her grief, which she
dared not express before her aunt, and which she rather thought it was
wrong to feel at all after the long hoping, and planning, and contriving
they had gone through at home, before her wardrobe could be arranged so
as to suit her grander circumstances, and before papa could leave his
parish to come up to London, even for a few days.

Now she had got to love the old nursery, though it was but a dismantled
place; and she looked all round, with a kind of cat-like regret, at the
idea of leaving it for ever in three days.

'Ah Newton!' said she, 'I think we shall all be sorry to leave this dear
old room.'

'Indeed, miss, I shan't for one. My eyes are not so good as they were,
and the light here is so bad that I can't see to mend laces except just
at the window, where there's always a shocking draught--enough to give
one one's death of cold.'

Well, I dare say you will have both good light and plenty of warmth at
Naples. You must keep as much of your darning as you can till then.
Thank you, Newton, I can take them down--you're busy.'

So Margaret went down laden with shawls, and snuffing up their spicy
Eastern smell. Her aunt asked her to stand as a sort of lay figure on
which to display them, as Edith was still asleep. No one thought about
it; but Margaret's tall, finely made figure, in the black silk dress
which she was wearing as mourning for some distant relative of her
father's, set off the long beautiful folds of the gorgeous shawls that
would have half-smothered Edith. Margaret stood right under the
chandelier, quite silent and passive, while her aunt adjusted the
draperies. Occasionally, as she was turned round, she caught a glimpse
of herself in the mirror over the chimney-piece, and smiled at her own
appearance there--the familiar features in the usual garb of a princess.
She touched the shawls gently as they hung around her, and took a
pleasure in their soft feel and their brilliant colours, and rather
liked to be dressed in such splendour--enjoying it much as a child would
do, with a quiet pleased smile on her lips. Just then the door opened,
and Mr. Henry Lennox was suddenly announced. Some of the ladies started
back, as if half-ashamed of their feminine interest in dress. Mrs. Shaw
held out her hand to the new-comer; Margaret stood perfectly still,
thinking she might be yet wanted as a sort of block for the shawls; but
looking at Mr. Lennox with a bright, amused face, as if sure of his
sympathy in her sense of the ludicrousness at being thus surprised.

Her aunt was so much absorbed in asking Mr. Henry Lennox--who had not
been able to come to dinner--all sorts of questions about his brother
the bridegroom, his sister the bridesmaid (coming with the Captain from
Scotland for the occasion), and various other members of the Lennox
family, that Margaret saw she was no more wanted as shawl-bearer, and
devoted herself to the amusement of the other visitors, whom her aunt
had for the moment forgotten. Almost immediately, Edith came in from the
back drawing-room, winking and blinking her eyes at the stronger light,
shaking back her slightly-ruffled curls, and altogether looking like the
Sleeping Beauty just startled from her dreams. Even in her slumber she
had instinctively felt that a Lennox was worth rousing herself for; and
she had a multitude of questions to ask about dear Janet, the future,
unseen sister-in-law, for whom she professed so much affection, that if
Margaret had not been very proud she might have almost felt jealous of
the mushroom rival. As Margaret sank rather more into the background on
her aunt's joining the conversation, she saw Henry Lennox directing his
look towards a vacant seat near her; and she knew perfectly well that as
soon as Edith released him from her questioning, he would take
possession of that chair. She had not been quite sure, from her aunt's
rather confused account of his engagements, whether he would come that
night; it was almost a surprise to see him; and now she was sure of a
pleasant evening. He liked and disliked pretty nearly the same things
that she did. Margaret's face was lightened up into an honest, open
brightness. By-and-by he came. She received him with a smile which had
not a tinge of shyness or self-consciousness in it.

'Well, I suppose you are all in the depths of business--ladies'
business, I mean. Very different to my business, which is the real true
law business. Playing with shawls is very different work to drawing up
settlements.

'Ah, I knew how you would be amused to find us all so occupied in
admiring finery. But really Indian shawls are very perfect things of
their kind.'

'I have no doubt they are. Their prices are very perfect, too. Nothing
wanting.' The gentlemen came dropping in one by one, and the buzz and
noise deepened in tone.

'This is your last dinner-party, is it not? There are no more before
Thursday?'

'No. I think after this evening we shall feel at rest, which I am sure I
have not done for many weeks; at least, that kind of rest when the hands
have nothing more to do, and all the arrangements are complete for an
event which must occupy one's head and heart. I shall be glad to have
time to think, and I am sure Edith will.'

'I am not so sure about her; but I can fancy that you will. Whenever I
have seen you lately, you have been carried away by a whirlwind of some
other person's making.'

'Yes,' said Margaret, rather sadly, remembering the never-ending
commotion about trifles that had been going on for more than a month
past: 'I wonder if a marriage must always be preceded by what you call a
whirlwind, or whether in some cases there might not rather be a calm and
peaceful time just before it.'

'Cinderella's godmother ordering the trousseau, the wedding-breakfast,
writing the notes of invitation, for instance,' said Mr. Lennox,
laughing.

'But are all these quite necessary troubles?' asked Margaret, looking up
straight at him for an answer. A sense of indescribable weariness of all
the arrangements for a pretty effect, in which Edith had been busied as
supreme authority for the last six weeks, oppressed her just now; and
she really wanted some one to help her to a few pleasant, quiet ideas
connected with a marriage.

'Oh, of course,' he replied with a change to gravity in his tone. 'There
are forms and ceremonies to be gone through, not so much to satisfy
oneself, as to stop the world's mouth, without which stoppage there
would be very little satisfaction in life. But how would you have a
wedding arranged?'

'Oh, I have never thought much about it; only I should like it to be a
very fine summer morning; and I should like to walk to church through
the shade of trees; and not to have so many bridesmaids, and to have no
wedding-breakfast. I dare say I am resolving against the very things
that have given me the most trouble just now.'

'No, I don't think you are. The idea of stately simplicity accords well
with your character.'

Margaret did not quite like this speech; she winced away from it more,
from remembering former occasions on which he had tried to lead her into
a discussion (in which he took the complimentary part) about her own
character and ways of going on. She cut his speech rather short by
saying:

'It is natural for me to think of Helstone church, and the walk to it,
rather than of driving up to a London church in the middle of a paved
street.'

'Tell me about Helstone. You have never described it to me. I should
like to have some idea of the place you will be living in, when
ninety-six Harley Street will be looking dingy and dirty, and dull, and
shut up. Is Helstone a village, or a town, in the first place?'

'Oh, only a hamlet; I don't think I could call it a village at all.
There is the church and a few houses near it on the green--cottages,
rather--with roses growing all over them.'

'And flowering all the year round, especially at Christmas--make your
picture complete,' said he.

'No,' replied Margaret, somewhat annoyed, 'I am not making a picture. I
am trying to describe Helstone as it really is. You should not have said
that.'

'I am penitent,' he answered. 'Only it really sounded like a village in
a tale rather than in real life.'

'And so it is,' replied Margaret, eagerly. 'All the other places in
England that I have seen seem so hard and prosaic-looking, after the New
Forest. Helstone is like a village in a poem--in one of Tennyson's
poems. But I won't try and describe it any more. You would only laugh at
me if I told you what I think of it--what it really is.'

'Indeed, I would not. But I see you are going to be very resolved. Well,
then, tell me that which I should like still better to know what the
parsonage is like.'

'Oh, I can't describe my home. It is home, and I can't put its charm
into words.'

'I submit. You are rather severe to-night, Margaret.

'How?' said she, turning her large soft eyes round full upon him. 'I did
not know I was.'

'Why, because I made an unlucky remark, you will neither tell me what
Helstone is like, nor will you say anything about your home, though I
have told you how much I want to hear about both, the latter
especially.'

'But indeed I cannot tell you about my own home. I don't quite think it
is a thing to be talked about, unless you knew it.'

'Well, then'--pausing for a moment--'tell me what you do there. Here you
read, or have lessons, or otherwise improve your mind, till the middle
of the day; take a walk before lunch, go a drive with your aunt after,
and have some kind of engagement in the evening. There, now fill up your
day at Helstone. Shall you ride, drive, or walk?'

'Walk, decidedly. We have no horse, not even for papa. He walks to the
very extremity of his parish. The walks are so beautiful, it would be a
shame to drive--almost a shame to ride.'

'Shall you garden much? That, I believe, is a proper employment for
young ladies in the country.'

'I don't know. I am afraid I shan't like such hard work.'

'Archery parties--pic-nics--race-balls--hunt-balls?'

'Oh no!' said she, laughing. 'Papa's living is very small; and even if
we were near such things, I doubt if I should go to them.'

'I see, you won't tell me anything. You will only tell me that you are
not going to do this and that. Before the vacation ends, I think I shall
pay you a call, and see what you really do employ yourself in.'

'I hope you will. Then you will see for yourself how beautiful Helstone
is. Now I must go. Edith is sitting down to play, and I just know enough
of music to turn over the leaves for her; and besides, Aunt Shaw won't
like us to talk.' Edith played brilliantly. In the middle of the piece
the door half-opened, and Edith saw Captain Lennox hesitating whether to
come in. She threw down her music, and rushed out of the room, leaving
Margaret standing confused and blushing to explain to the astonished
guests what vision had shown itself to cause Edith's sudden flight.
Captain Lennox had come earlier than was expected; or was it really so
late? They looked at their watches, were duly shocked, and took their
leave.

Then Edith came back, glowing with pleasure, half-shyly, half-proudly
leading in her tall handsome Captain. His brother shook hands with him,
and Mrs. Shaw welcomed him in her gentle kindly way, which had always
something plaintive in it, arising from the long habit of considering
herself a victim to an uncongenial marriage. Now that, the General being
gone, she had every good of life, with as few drawbacks as possible, she
had been rather perplexed to find an anxiety, if not a sorrow. She had,
however, of late settled upon her own health as a source of
apprehension; she had a nervous little cough whenever she thought about
it; and some complaisant doctor ordered her just what she desired,--a
winter in Italy. Mrs. Shaw had as strong wishes as most people, but she
never liked to do anything from the open and acknowledged motive of her
own good will and pleasure; she preferred being compelled to gratify
herself by some other person's command or desire. She really did
persuade herself that she was submitting to some hard external
necessity; and thus she was able to moan and complain in her soft
manner, all the time she was in reality doing just what she liked.

It was in this way she began to speak of her own journey to Captain
Lennox, who assented, as in duty bound, to all his future mother-in-law
said, while his eyes sought Edith, who was busying herself in
rearranging the tea-table, and ordering up all sorts of good things, in
spite of his assurances that he had dined within the last two hours.

Mr. Henry Lennox stood leaning against the chimney-piece, amused with
the family scene. He was close by his handsome brother; he was the plain
one in a singularly good-looking family; but his face was intelligent,
keen, and mobile; and now and then Margaret wondered what it was that he
could be thinking about, while he kept silence, but was evidently
observing, with an interest that was slightly sarcastic, all that Edith
and she were doing. The sarcastic feeling was called out by Mrs. Shaw's
conversation with his brother; it was separate from the interest which
was excited by what he saw. He thought it a pretty sight to see the two
cousins so busy in their little arrangements about the table. Edith
chose to do most herself. She was in a humour to enjoy showing her lover
how well she could behave as a soldier's wife. She found out that the
water in the urn was cold, and ordered up the great kitchen tea-kettle;
the only consequence of which was that when she met it at the door, and
tried to carry it in, it was too heavy for her, and she came in pouting,
with a black mark on her muslin gown, and a little round white hand
indented by the handle, which she took to show to Captain Lennox, just
like a hurt child, and, of course, the remedy was the same in both
cases. Margaret's quickly-adjusted spirit-lamp was the most efficacious
contrivance, though not so like the gypsy-encampment which Edith, in
some of her moods, chose to consider the nearest resemblance to a
barrack-life. After this evening all was bustle till the wedding was
over.




CHAPTER II

ROSES AND THORNS

    'By the soft green light in the woody glade,
     On the banks of moss where thy childhood played;
     By the household tree, thro' which thine eye
     First looked in love to the summer sky.'
                MRS. HEMANS.


Margaret was once more in her morning dress, travelling quietly home
with her father, who had come up to assist at the wedding. Her mother
had been detained at home by a multitude of half-reasons, none of which
anybody fully understood, except Mr. Hale, who was perfectly aware that
all his arguments in favour of a grey satin gown, which was midway
between oldness and newness, had proved unavailing; and that, as he had
not the money to equip his wife afresh, from top to toe, she would not
show herself at her only sister's only child's wedding. If Mrs. Shaw had
guessed at the real reason why Mrs. Hale did not accompany her husband,
she would have showered down gowns upon her; but it was nearly twenty
years since Mrs. Shaw had been the poor, pretty Miss Beresford, and she
had really forgotten all grievances except that of the unhappiness
arising from disparity of age in married life, on which she could
descant by the half-hour. Dearest Maria had married the man of her
heart, only eight years older than herself, with the sweetest temper,
and that blue-black hair one so seldom sees. Mr. Hale was one of the
most delightful preachers she had ever heard, and a perfect model of a
parish priest. Perhaps it was not quite a logical deduction from all
these premises, but it was still Mrs. Shaw's characteristic conclusion,
as she thought over her sister's lot: 'Married for love, what can
dearest Maria have to wish for in this world?' Mrs. Hale, if she spoke
truth, might have answered with a ready-made list, 'a silver-grey glace
silk, a white chip bonnet, oh! dozens of things for the wedding, and
hundreds of things for the house.' Margaret only knew that her mother
had not found it convenient to come, and she was not sorry to think that
their meeting and greeting would take place at Helstone parsonage,
rather than, during the confusion of the last two or three days, in the
house in Harley Street, where she herself had had to play the part of
Figaro, and was wanted everywhere at one and the same time. Her mind and
body ached now with the recollection of all she had done and said within
the last forty-eight hours. The farewells so hurriedly taken, amongst
all the other good-byes, of those she had lived with so long, oppressed
her now with a sad regret for the times that were no more; it did not
signify what those times had been, they were gone never to return.
Margaret's heart felt more heavy than she could ever have thought it
possible in going to her own dear home, the place and the life she had
longed for for years--at that time of all times for yearning and
longing, just before the sharp senses lose their outlines in sleep. She
took her mind away with a wrench from the recollection of the past to
the bright serene contemplation of the hopeful future. Her eyes began to
see, not visions of what had been, but the sight actually before her;
her dear father leaning back asleep in the railway carriage. His
blue-black hair was grey now, and lay thinly over his brows. The bones
of his face were plainly to be seen--too plainly for beauty, if his
features had been less finely cut; as it was, they had a grace if not a
comeliness of their own. The face was in repose; but it was rather rest
after weariness, than the serene calm of the countenance of one who led
a placid, contented life. Margaret was painfully struck by the worn,
anxious expression; and she went back over the open and avowed
circumstances of her father's life, to find the cause for the lines that
spoke so plainly of habitual distress and depression.

'Poor Frederick!' thought she, sighing. 'Oh! if Frederick had but been a
clergyman, instead of going into the navy, and being lost to us all! I
wish I knew all about it. I never understood it from Aunt Shaw; I only
knew he could not come back to England because of that terrible affair.
Poor dear papa! how sad he looks! I am so glad I am going home, to be at
hand to comfort him and mamma.

She was ready with a bright smile, in which there was not a trace of
fatigue, to greet her father when he awakened. He smiled back again, but
faintly, as if it were an unusual exertion. His face returned into its
lines of habitual anxiety. He had a trick of half-opening his mouth as
if to speak, which constantly unsettled the form of the lips, and gave
the face an undecided expression. But he had the same large, soft eyes
as his daughter,--eyes which moved slowly and almost grandly round in
their orbits, and were well veiled by their transparent white eyelids.
Margaret was more like him than like her mother. Sometimes people
wondered that parents so handsome should have a daughter who was so far
from regularly beautiful; not beautiful at all, was occasionally said.
Her mouth was wide; no rosebud that could only open just enough to let
out a 'yes' and 'no,' and 'an't please you, sir.' But the wide mouth was
one soft curve of rich red lips; and the skin, if not white and fair,
was of an ivory smoothness and delicacy. If the look on her face was, in
general, too dignified and reserved for one so young, now, talking to
her father, it was bright as the morning,--full of dimples, and glances
that spoke of childish gladness, and boundless hope in the future.

It was the latter part of July when Margaret returned home. The forest
trees were all one dark, full, dusky green; the fern below them caught
all the slanting sunbeams; the weather was sultry and broodingly still.
Margaret used to tramp along by her father's side, crushing down the
fern with a cruel glee, as she felt it yield under her light foot, and
send up the fragrance peculiar to it,--out on the broad commons into the
warm scented light, seeing multitudes of wild, free, living creatures,
revelling in the sunshine, and the herbs and flowers it called forth.
This life--at least these walks--realised all Margaret's anticipations.
She took a pride in her forest. Its people were her people. She made
hearty friends with them; learned and delighted in using their peculiar
words; took up her freedom amongst them; nursed their babies; talked or
read with slow distinctness to their old people; carried dainty messes
to their sick; resolved before long to teach at the school, where her
father went every day as to an appointed task, but she was continually
tempted off to go and see some individual friend--man, woman, or
child--in some cottage in the green shade of the forest. Her
out-of-doors life was perfect. Her in-doors life had its drawbacks. With
the healthy shame of a child, she blamed herself for her keenness of
sight, in perceiving that all was not as it should be there. Her
mother--her mother always so kind and tender towards her--seemed now and
then so much discontented with their situation; thought that the bishop
strangely neglected his episcopal duties, in not giving Mr. Hale a
better living; and almost reproached her husband because he could not
bring himself to say that he wished to leave the parish, and undertake
the charge of a larger. He would sigh aloud as he answered, that if he
could do what he ought in little Helstone, he should be thankful; but
every day he was more overpowered; the world became more bewildering. At
each repeated urgency of his wife, that he would put himself in the way
of seeking some preferment, Margaret saw that her father shrank more and
more; and she strove at such times to reconcile her mother to Helstone.
Mrs. Hale said that the near neighbourhood of so many trees affected her
health; and Margaret would try to tempt her forth on to the beautiful,
broad, upland, sun-streaked, cloud-shadowed common; for she was sure
that her mother had accustomed herself too much to an in-doors life,
seldom extending her walks beyond the church, the school, and the
neighbouring cottages. This did good for a time; but when the autumn
drew on, and the weather became more changeable, her mother's idea of
the unhealthiness of the place increased; and she repined even more
frequently that her husband, who was more learned than Mr. Hume, a
better parish priest than Mr. Houldsworth, should not have met with the
preferment that these two former neighbours of theirs had done.

This marring of the peace of home, by long hours of discontent, was what
Margaret was unprepared for. She knew, and had rather revelled in the
idea, that she should have to give up many luxuries, which had only been
troubles and trammels to her freedom in Harley Street. Her keen
enjoyment of every sensuous pleasure, was balanced finely, if not
overbalanced, by her conscious pride in being able to do without them
all, if need were. But the cloud never comes in that quarter of the
horizon from which we watch for it. There had been slight complaints and
passing regrets on her mother's part, over some trifle connected with
Helstone, and her father's position there, when Margaret had been
spending her holidays at home before; but in the general happiness of
the recollection of those times, she had forgotten the small details
which were not so pleasant. In the latter half of September, the
autumnal rains and storms came on, and Margaret was obliged to remain
more in the house than she had hitherto done. Helstone was at some
distance from any neighbours of their own standard of cultivation.

'It is undoubtedly one of the most out-of-the-way places in England,'
said Mrs. Hale, in one of her plaintive moods. 'I can't help regretting
constantly that papa has really no one to associate with here; he is so
thrown away; seeing no one but farmers and labourers from week's end to
week's end. If we only lived at the other side of the parish, it would
be something; there we should be almost within walking distance of the
Stansfields; certainly the Gormans would be within a walk.'

'Gormans,' said Margaret. 'Are those the Gormans who made their fortunes
in trade at Southampton? Oh! I'm glad we don't visit them. I don't like
shoppy people. I think we are far better off, knowing only cottagers and
labourers, and people without pretence.'

'You must not be so fastidious, Margaret, dear!' said her mother,
secretly thinking of a young and handsome Mr. Gorman whom she had once
met at Mr. Hume's.

'No! I call mine a very comprehensive taste; I like all people whose
occupations have to do with land; I like soldiers and sailors, and the
three learned professions, as they call them. I'm sure you don't want me
to admire butchers and bakers, and candlestick-makers, do you, mamma?'

'But the Gormans were neither butchers nor bakers, but very respectable
coach-builders.'

'Very well. Coach-building is a trade all the same, and I think a much
more useless one than that of butchers or bakers. Oh! how tired I used
to be of the drives every day in Aunt Shaw's carriage, and how I longed
to walk!'

And walk Margaret did, in spite of the weather. She was so happy out of
doors, at her father's side, that she almost danced; and with the soft
violence of the west wind behind her, as she crossed some heath, she
seemed to be borne onwards, as lightly and easily as the fallen leaf
that was wafted along by the autumnal breeze. But the evenings were
rather difficult to fill up agreeably. Immediately after tea her father
withdrew into his small library, and she and her mother were left alone.
Mrs. Hale had never cared much for books, and had discouraged her
husband, very early in their married life, in his desire of reading
aloud to her, while she worked. At one time they had tried backgammon as
a resource; but as Mr. Hale grew to take an increasing interest in his
school and his parishioners, he found that the interruptions which arose
out of these duties were regarded as hardships by his wife, not to be
accepted as the natural conditions of his profession, but to be
regretted and struggled against by her as they severally arose. So he
withdrew, while the children were yet young, into his library, to spend
his evenings (if he were at home), in reading the speculative and
metaphysical books which were his delight.

When Margaret had been here before, she had brought down with her a
great box of books, recommended by masters or governess, and had found
the summer's day all too short to get through the reading she had to do
before her return to town. Now there were only the well-bound
little-read English Classics, which were weeded out of her father's
library to fill up the small book-shelves in the drawing-room. Thomson's
Seasons, Hayley's Cowper, Middleton's Cicero, were by far the lightest,
newest, and most amusing. The book-shelves did not afford much resource.
Margaret told her mother every particular of her London life, to all of
which Mrs. Hale listened with interest, sometimes amused and
questioning, at others a little inclined to compare her sister's
circumstances of ease and comfort with the narrower means at Helstone
vicarage. On such evenings Margaret was apt to stop talking rather
abruptly, and listen to the drip-drip of the rain upon the leads of the
little bow-window. Once or twice Margaret found herself mechanically
counting the repetition of the monotonous sound, while she wondered if
she might venture to put a question on a subject very near to her heart,
and ask where Frederick was now; what he was doing; how long it was
since they had heard from him. But a consciousness that her mother's
delicate health, and positive dislike to Helstone, all dated from the
time of the mutiny in which Frederick had been engaged,--the full
account of which Margaret had never heard, and which now seemed doomed
to be buried in sad oblivion,--made her pause and turn away from the
subject each time she approached it. When she was with her mother, her
father seemed the best person to apply to for information; and when with
him, she thought that she could speak more easily to her mother.
Probably there was nothing much to be heard that was new. In one of the
letters she had received before leaving Harley Street, her father had
told her that they had heard from Frederick; he was still at Rio, and
very well in health, and sent his best love to her; which was dry bones,
but not the living intelligence she longed for. Frederick was always
spoken of, in the rare times when his name was mentioned, as 'Poor
Frederick.' His room was kept exactly as he had left it; and was
regularly dusted, and put into order by Dixon, Mrs. Hale's maid, who
touched no other part of the household work, but always remembered the
day when she had been engaged by Lady Beresford as ladies' maid to Sir
John's wards, the pretty Miss Beresfords, the belles of Rutlandshire.
Dixon had always considered Mr. Hale as the blight which had fallen upon
her young lady's prospects in life. If Miss Beresford had not been in
such a hurry to marry a poor country clergyman, there was no knowing
what she might not have become. But Dixon was too loyal to desert her in
her affliction and downfall (alias her married life). She remained with
her, and was devoted to her interests; always considering herself as the
good and protecting fairy, whose duty it was to baffle the malignant
giant, Mr. Hale. Master Frederick had been her favorite and pride; and
it was with a little softening of her dignified look and manner, that
she went in weekly to arrange the chamber as carefully as if he might be
coming home that very evening. Margaret could not help believing that
there had been some late intelligence of Frederick, unknown to her
mother, which was making her father anxious and uneasy. Mrs. Hale did
not seem to perceive any alteration in her husband's looks or ways. His
spirits were always tender and gentle, readily affected by any small
piece of intelligence concerning the welfare of others. He would be
depressed for many days after witnessing a death-bed, or hearing of any
crime. But now Margaret noticed an absence of mind, as if his thoughts
were pre-occupied by some subject, the oppression of which could not be
relieved by any daily action, such as comforting the survivors, or
teaching at the school in hope of lessening the evils in the generation
to come. Mr. Hale did not go out among his parishioners as much as
usual; he was more shut up in his study; was anxious for the village
postman, whose summons to the house-hold was a rap on the back-kitchen
window-shutter--a signal which at one time had often to be repeated
before any one was sufficiently alive to the hour of the day to
understand what it was, and attend to him. Now Mr. Hale loitered about
the garden if the morning was fine, and if not, stood dreamily by the
study window until the postman had called, or gone down the lane, giving
a half-respectful, half-confidential shake of the head to the parson,
who watched him away beyond the sweet-briar hedge, and past the great
arbutus, before he turned into the room to begin his day's work, with
all the signs of a heavy heart and an occupied mind.

But Margaret was at an age when any apprehension, not absolutely based
on a knowledge of facts, is easily banished for a time by a bright sunny
day, or some happy outward circumstance. And when the brilliant fourteen
fine days of October came on, her cares were all blown away as lightly
as thistledown, and she thought of nothing but the glories of the
forest. The fern-harvest was over, and now that the rain was gone, many
a deep glade was accessible, into which Margaret had only peeped in July
and August weather. She had learnt drawing with Edith; and she had
sufficiently regretted, during the gloom of the bad weather, her idle
revelling in the beauty of the woodlands while it had yet been fine, to
make her determined to sketch what she could before winter fairly set
in. Accordingly, she was busy preparing her board one morning, when
Sarah, the housemaid, threw wide open the drawing-room door and
announced, 'Mr. Henry Lennox.'




CHAPTER III

'THE MORE HASTE THE WORSE SPEED'

    'Learn to win a lady's faith
     Nobly, as the thing is high;
     Bravely, as for life and death--
     With a loyal gravity.

     Lead her from the festive boards,
     Point her to the starry skies,
     Guard her, by your truthful words,
     Pure from courtship's flatteries.'
             MRS. BROWNING.


'Mr. Henry Lennox.' Margaret had been thinking of him only a moment
before, and remembering his inquiry into her probable occupations at
home. It was 'parler du soleil et l'on en voit les rayons;' and the
brightness of the sun came over Margaret's face as she put down her
board, and went forward to shake hands with him. 'Tell mamma, Sarah,'
said she. 'Mamma and I want to ask you so many questions about Edith; I
am so much obliged to you for coming.'

'Did not I say that I should?' asked he, in a lower tone than that in
which she had spoken.

'But I heard of you so far away in the Highlands that I never thought
Hampshire could come in.

'Oh!' said he, more lightly, 'our young couple were playing such foolish
pranks, running all sorts of risks, climbing this mountain, sailing on
that lake, that I really thought they needed a Mentor to take care of
them. And indeed they did; they were quite beyond my uncle's management,
and kept the old gentleman in a panic for sixteen hours out of the
twenty-four. Indeed, when I once saw how unfit they were to be trusted
alone, I thought it my duty not to leave them till I had seen them
safely embarked at Plymouth.'

'Have you been at Plymouth? Oh! Edith never named that. To be sure, she
has written in such a hurry lately. Did they really sail on Tuesday?'

'Really sailed, and relieved me from many responsibilities. Edith gave
me all sorts of messages for you. I believe I have a little diminutive
note somewhere; yes, here it is.'

'Oh! thank you,' exclaimed Margaret; and then, half wishing to read it
alone and unwatched, she made the excuse of going to tell her mother
again (Sarah surely had made some mistake) that Mr. Lennox was there.

When she had left the room, he began in his scrutinising way to look
about him. The little drawing-room was looking its best in the streaming
light of the morning sun. The middle window in the bow was opened, and
clustering roses and the scarlet honeysuckle came peeping round the
corner; the small lawn was gorgeous with verbenas and geraniums of all
bright colours. But the very brightness outside made the colours within
seem poor and faded. The carpet was far from new; the chintz had been
often washed; the whole apartment was smaller and shabbier than he had
expected, as back-ground and frame-work for Margaret, herself so
queenly. He took up one of the books lying on the table; it was the
Paradiso of Dante, in the proper old Italian binding of white vellum and
gold; by it lay a dictionary, and some words copied out in Margaret's
hand-writing. They were a dull list of words, but somehow he liked
looking at them. He put them down with a sigh.

'The living is evidently as small as she said. It seems strange, for the
Beresfords belong to a good family.'

Margaret meanwhile had found her mother. It was one of Mrs. Hale's
fitful days, when everything was a difficulty and a hardship; and Mr.
Lennox's appearance took this shape, although secretly she felt
complimented by his thinking it worth while to call.

'It is most unfortunate! We are dining early to-day, and having nothing
but cold meat, in order that the servants may get on with their ironing;
and yet, of course, we must ask him to dinner--Edith's brother-in-law
and all. And your papa is in such low spirits this morning about
something--I don't know what. I went into the study just now, and he had
his face on the table, covering it with his hands. I told him I was sure
Helstone air did not agree with him any more than with me, and he
suddenly lifted up his head, and begged me not to speak a word more
against Helstone, he could not bear it; if there was one place he loved
on earth it was Helstone. But I am sure, for all that, it is the damp
and relaxing air.'

Margaret felt as if a thin cold cloud had come between her and the sun.
She had listened patiently, in hopes that it might be some relief to her
mother to unburden herself; but now it was time to draw her back to Mr.
Lennox.

'Papa likes Mr. Lennox; they got on together famously at the wedding
breakfast. I dare say his coming will do papa good. And never mind the
dinner, dear mamma. Cold meat will do capitally for a lunch, which is
the light in which Mr. Lennox will most likely look upon a two o'clock
dinner.'

'But what are we to do with him till then? It is only half-past ten
now.'

'I'll ask him to go out sketching with me. I know he draws, and that
will take him out of your way, mamma. Only do come in now; he will think
it so strange if you don't.'

Mrs. Hale took off her black silk apron, and smoothed her face. She
looked a very pretty lady-like woman, as she greeted Mr. Lennox with the
cordiality due to one who was almost a relation. He evidently expected
to be asked to spend the day, and accepted the invitation with a glad
readiness that made Mrs. Hale wish she could add something to the cold
beef. He was pleased with everything; delighted with Margaret's idea of
going out sketching together; would not have Mr. Hale disturbed for the
world, with the prospect of so soon meeting him at dinner. Margaret
brought out her drawing materials for him to choose from; and after the
paper and brushes had been duly selected, the two set out in the
merriest spirits in the world.

'Now, please, just stop here for a minute or two, said Margaret. 'These
are the cottages that haunted me so during the rainy fortnight,
reproaching me for not having sketched them.'

'Before they tumbled down and were no more seen. Truly, if they are to
be sketched--and they are very picturesque--we had better not put it off
till next year. But where shall we sit?'

'Oh! You might have come straight from chambers in the Temple,' instead
of having been two months in the Highlands! Look at this beautiful trunk
of a tree, which the wood-cutters have left just in the right place for
the light. I will put my plaid over it, and it will be a regular forest
throne.'

'With your feet in that puddle for a regal footstool! Stay, I will move,
and then you can come nearer this way. Who lives in these cottages?'

'They were built by squatters fifty or sixty years ago. One is
uninhabited; the foresters are going to take it down, as soon as the old
man who lives in the other is dead, poor old fellow! Look--there he
is--I must go and speak to him. He is so deaf you will hear all our
secrets.'

The old man stood bareheaded in the sun, leaning on his stick at the
front of his cottage. His stiff features relaxed into a slow smile as
Margaret went up and spoke to him. Mr. Lennox hastily introduced the two
figures into his sketch, and finished up the landscape with a
subordinate reference to them--as Margaret perceived, when the time came
for getting up, putting away water, and scraps of paper, and exhibiting
to each other their sketches. She laughed and blushed: Mr. Lennox
watched her countenance.

'Now, I call that treacherous,' said she. 'I little thought you were
making old Isaac and me into subjects, when you told me to ask him the
history of these cottages.'

'It was irresistible. You can't know how strong a temptation it was. I
hardly dare tell you how much I shall like this sketch.'

He was not quite sure whether she heard this latter sentence before she
went to the brook to wash her palette. She came back rather flushed, but
looking perfectly innocent and unconscious. He was glad of it, for the
speech had slipped from him unawares--a rare thing in the case of a man
who premeditated his actions so much as Henry Lennox.

The aspect of home was all right and bright when they reached it. The
clouds on her mother's brow had cleared off under the propitious
influence of a brace of carp, most opportunely presented by a neighbour.
Mr. Hale had returned from his morning's round, and was awaiting his
visitor just outside the wicket gate that led into the garden. He looked
a complete gentleman in his rather threadbare coat and well-worn hat.

Margaret was proud of her father; she had always a fresh and tender
pride in seeing how favourably he impressed every stranger; still her
quick eye sought over his face and found there traces of some unusual
disturbance, which was only put aside, not cleared away.

Mr. Hale asked to look at their sketches.

'I think you have made the tints on the thatch too dark, have you not?'
as he returned Margaret's to her, and held out his hand for Mr.
Lennox's, which was withheld from him one moment, no more.

'No, papa! I don't think I have. The house-leek and stone-crop have
grown so much darker in the rain. Is it not like, papa?' said she,
peeping over his shoulder, as he looked at the figures in Mr. Lennox's
drawing.

'Yes, very like. Your figure and way of holding yourself is capital. And
it is just poor old Isaac's stiff way of stooping his long rheumatic
back. What is this hanging from the branch of the tree? Not a bird's
nest, surely.'

'Oh no! that is my bonnet. I never can draw with my bonnet on; it makes
my head so hot. I wonder if I could manage figures. There are so many
people about here whom I should like to sketch.'

'I should say that a likeness you very much wish to take you would
always succeed in,' said Mr. Lennox. 'I have great faith in the power of
will. I think myself I have succeeded pretty well in yours.' Mr. Hale
had preceded them into the house, while Margaret was lingering to pluck
some roses, with which to adorn her morning gown for dinner.

'A regular London girl would understand the implied meaning of that
speech,' thought Mr. Lennox. 'She would be up to looking through every
speech that a young man made her for the arriere-pensee of a compliment.
But I don't believe Margaret,--Stay!' exclaimed he, 'Let me help you;'
and he gathered for her some velvety cramoisy roses that were above her
reach, and then dividing the spoil he placed two in his button-hole, and
sent her in, pleased and happy, to arrange her flowers.

The conversation at dinner flowed on quietly and agreeably. There were
plenty of questions to be asked on both sides--the latest intelligence
which each could give of Mrs. Shaw's movements in Italy to be exchanged;
and in the interest of what was said, the unpretending simplicity of the
parsonage-ways--above all, in the neighbourhood of Margaret, Mr. Lennox
forgot the little feeling of disappointment with which he had at first
perceived that she had spoken but the simple truth when she had
described her father's living as very small.

'Margaret, my child, you might have gathered us some pears for our
dessert,' said Mr. Hale, as the hospitable luxury of a freshly-decanted
bottle of wine was placed on the table.

Mrs. Hale was hurried. It seemed as if desserts were impromptu and
unusual things at the parsonage; whereas, if Mr. Hale would only have
looked behind him, he would have seen biscuits and marmalade, and what
not, all arranged in formal order on the sideboard. But the idea of
pears had taken possession of Mr. Hale's mind, and was not to be got rid
of.

'There are a few brown beurres against the south wall which are worth
all foreign fruits and preserves. Run, Margaret, and gather us some.'

'I propose that we adjourn into the garden, and eat them there' said Mr.
Lennox.

'Nothing is so delicious as to set one's teeth into the crisp, juicy
fruit, warm and scented by the sun. The worst is, the wasps are impudent
enough to dispute it with one, even at the very crisis and summit of
enjoyment.

He rose, as if to follow Margaret, who had disappeared through the
window he only awaited Mrs. Hale's permission. She would rather have
wound up the dinner in the proper way, and with all the ceremonies which
had gone on so smoothly hitherto, especially as she and Dixon had got
out the finger-glasses from the store-room on purpose to be as correct
as became General Shaw's widow's sister, but as Mr. Hale got up
directly, and prepared to accompany his guest, she could only submit.

'I shall arm myself with a knife,' said Mr. Hale: 'the days of eating
fruit so primitively as you describe are over with me. I must pare it
and quarter it before I can enjoy it.'

Margaret made a plate for the pears out of a beetroot leaf, which threw
up their brown gold colour admirably. Mr. Lennox looked more at her than
at the pears; but her father, inclined to cull fastidiously the very
zest and perfection of the hour he had stolen from his anxiety, chose
daintily the ripest fruit, and sat down on the garden bench to enjoy it
at his leisure. Margaret and Mr. Lennox strolled along the little
terrace-walk under the south wall, where the bees still hummed and
worked busily in their hives.

'What a perfect life you seem to live here! I have always felt rather
contemptuously towards the poets before, with their wishes, "Mine be a
cot beside a hill," and that sort of thing: but now I am afraid that the
truth is, I have been nothing better than a cockney. Just now I feel as
if twenty years' hard study of law would be amply rewarded by one year
of such an exquisite serene life as this--such skies!' looking up--'such
crimson and amber foliage, so perfectly motionless as that!' pointing to
some of the great forest trees which shut in the garden as if it were a
nest.

'You must please to remember that our skies are not always as deep a
blue as they are now. We have rain, and our leaves do fall, and get
sodden: though I think Helstone is about as perfect a place as any in
the world. Recollect how you rather scorned my description of it one
evening in Harley Street: "a village in a tale."'

'Scorned, Margaret! That is rather a hard word.'

'Perhaps it is. Only I know I should have liked to have talked to you of
what I was very full at the time, and you--what must I call it,
then?--spoke disrespectfully of Helstone as a mere village in a tale.'

'I will never do so again,' said he, warmly. They turned the corner of
the walk.

'I could almost wish, Margaret---- ' he stopped and hesitated. It was so
unusual for the fluent lawyer to hesitate that Margaret looked up at
him, in a little state of questioning wonder; but in an instant--from
what about him she could not tell--she wished herself back with her
mother--her father--anywhere away from him, for she was sure he was
going to say something to which she should not know what to reply. In
another moment the strong pride that was in her came to conquer her
sudden agitation, which she hoped he had not perceived. Of course she
could answer, and answer the right thing; and it was poor and despicable
of her to shrink from hearing any speech, as if she had not power to put
an end to it with her high maidenly dignity.

'Margaret,' said he, taking her by surprise, and getting sudden
possession of her hand, so that she was forced to stand still and
listen, despising herself for the fluttering at her heart all the time;
'Margaret, I wish you did not like Helstone so much--did not seem so
perfectly calm and happy here. I have been hoping for these three months
past to find you regretting London--and London friends, a little--enough
to make you listen more kindly' (for she was quietly, but firmly,
striving to extricate her hand from his grasp) 'to one who has not much
to offer, it is true--nothing but prospects in the future--but who does
love you, Margaret, almost in spite of himself. Margaret, have I
startled you too much? Speak!' For he saw her lips quivering almost as
if she were going to cry. She made a strong effort to be calm; she would
not speak till she had succeeded in mastering her voice, and then she
said:

'I was startled. I did not know that you cared for me in that way. I
have always thought of you as a friend; and, please, I would rather go
on thinking of you so. I don't like to be spoken to as you have been
doing. I cannot answer you as you want me to do, and yet I should feel
so sorry if I vexed you.'

'Margaret,' said he, looking into her eyes, which met his with their
open, straight look, expressive of the utmost good faith and reluctance
to give pain.

'Do you'--he was going to say--'love any one else?' But it seemed as if
this question would be an insult to the pure serenity of those eyes.
'Forgive me I have been too abrupt. I am punished. Only let me hope.
Give me the poor comfort of telling me you have never seen any one whom
you could---- ' Again a pause. He could not end his sentence. Margaret
reproached herself acutely as the cause of his distress.

'Ah! if you had but never got this fancy into your head! It was such a
pleasure to think of you as a friend.'

'But I may hope, may I not, Margaret, that some time you will think of
me as a lover? Not yet, I see--there is no hurry--but some time---- '
She was silent for a minute or two, trying to discover the truth as it
was in her own heart, before replying; then she said:

'I have never thought of--you, but as a friend. I like to think of you
so; but I am sure I could never think of you as anything else. Pray, let
us both forget that all this' ('disagreeable,' she was going to say, but
stopped short) 'conversation has taken place.'

He paused before he replied. Then, in his habitual coldness of tone, he
answered:

'Of course, as your feelings are so decided, and as this conversation
has been so evidently unpleasant to you, it had better not be
remembered. That is all very fine in theory, that plan of forgetting
whatever is painful, but it will be somewhat difficult for me, at least,
to carry it into execution.'

'You are vexed,' said she, sadly; 'yet how can I help it?'

She looked so truly grieved as she said this, that he struggled for a
moment with his real disappointment, and then answered more cheerfully,
but still with a little hardness in his tone:

'You should make allowances for the mortification, not only of a lover,
Margaret, but of a man not given to romance in general--prudent,
worldly, as some people call me--who has been carried out of his usual
habits by the force of a passion--well, we will say no more of that; but
in the one outlet which he has formed for the deeper and better feelings
of his nature, he meets with rejection and repulse. I shall have to
console myself with scorning my own folly. A struggling barrister to
think of matrimony!'

Margaret could not answer this. The whole tone of it annoyed her. It
seemed to touch on and call out all the points of difference which had
often repelled her in him; while yet he was the pleasantest man, the
most sympathising friend, the person of all others who understood her
best in Harley Street. She felt a tinge of contempt mingle itself with
her pain at having refused him. Her beautiful lip curled in a slight
disdain. It was well that, having made the round of the garden, they
came suddenly upon Mr. Hale, whose whereabouts had been quite forgotten
by them. He had not yet finished the pear, which he had delicately
peeled in one long strip of silver-paper thinness, and which he was
enjoying in a deliberate manner. It was like the story of the eastern
king, who dipped his head into a basin of water, at the magician's
command, and ere he instantly took it out went through the experience of
a lifetime. Margaret felt stunned, and unable to recover her
self-possession enough to join in the trivial conversation that ensued
between her father and Mr. Lennox. She was grave, and little disposed to
speak; full of wonder when Mr. Lennox would go, and allow her to relax
into thought on the events of the last quarter of an hour. He was almost
as anxious to take his departure as she was for him to leave; but a few
minutes light and careless talking, carried on at whatever effort, was a
sacrifice which he owed to his mortified vanity, or his self-respect. He
glanced from time to time at her sad and pensive face.

'I am not so indifferent to her as she believes,' thought he to himself.
'I do not give up hope.'

Before a quarter of an hour was over, he had fallen into a way of
conversing with quiet sarcasm; speaking of life in London and life in
the country, as if he were conscious of his second mocking self, and
afraid of his own satire. Mr. Hale was puzzled. His visitor was a
different man to what he had seen him before at the wedding-breakfast,
and at dinner to-day; a lighter, cleverer, more worldly man, and, as
such, dissonant to Mr. Hale. It was a relief to all three when Mr.
Lennox said that he must go directly if he meant to catch the five
o'clock train. They proceeded to the house to find Mrs. Hale, and wish
her good-bye. At the last moment, Henry Lennox's real self broke through
the crust.

'Margaret, don't despise me; I have a heart, notwithstanding all this
good-for-nothing way of talking. As a proof of it, I believe I love you
more than ever--if I do not hate you--for the disdain with which you
have listened to me during this last half-hour. Good-bye,
Margaret--Margaret!'




CHAPTER IV

DOUBTS AND DIFFICULTIES

    'Cast me upon some naked shore,
     Where I may tracke
     Only the print of some sad wracke,
     If thou be there, though the seas roare,
     I shall no gentler calm implore.'
             HABINGTON.


He was gone. The house was shut up for the evening. No more deep blue
skies or crimson and amber tints. Margaret went up to dress for the
early tea, finding Dixon in a pretty temper from the interruption which
a visitor had naturally occasioned on a busy day. She showed it by
brushing away viciously at Margaret's hair, under pretence of being in a
great hurry to go to Mrs. Hale. Yet, after all, Margaret had to wait a
long time in the drawing-room before her mother came down. She sat by
herself at the fire, with unlighted candles on the table behind her,
thinking over the day, the happy walk, happy sketching, cheerful
pleasant dinner, and the uncomfortable, miserable walk in the garden.

How different men were to women! Here was she disturbed and unhappy,
because her instinct had made anything but a refusal impossible; while
he, not many minutes after he had met with a rejection of what ought to
have been the deepest, holiest proposal of his life, could speak as if
briefs, success, and all its superficial consequences of a good house,
clever and agreeable society, were the sole avowed objects of his
desires. Oh dear! how she could have loved him if he had but been
different, with a difference which she felt, on reflection, to be one
that went low--deep down. Then she took it into her head that, after
all, his lightness might be but assumed, to cover a bitterness of
disappointment which would have been stamped on her own heart if she had
loved and been rejected.

Her mother came into the room before this whirl of thoughts was adjusted
into anything like order. Margaret had to shake off the recollections of
what had been done and said through the day, and turn a sympathising
listener to the account of how Dixon had complained that the
ironing-blanket had been burnt again; and how Susan Lightfoot had been
seen with artificial flowers in her bonnet, thereby giving evidence of a
vain and giddy character. Mr. Hale sipped his tea in abstracted silence;
Margaret had the responses all to herself. She wondered how her father
and mother could be so forgetful, so regardless of their companion
through the day, as never to mention his name. She forgot that he had
not made them an offer.

After tea Mr. Hale got up, and stood with his elbow on the
chimney-piece, leaning his head on his hand, musing over something, and
from time to time sighing deeply. Mrs. Hale went out to consult with
Dixon about some winter clothing for the poor. Margaret was preparing
her mother's worsted work, and rather shrinking from the thought of the
long evening, and wishing bed-time were come that she might go over the
events of the day again.

'Margaret!' said Mr. Hale, at last, in a sort of sudden desperate way,
that made her start. 'Is that tapestry thing of immediate consequence? I
mean, can you leave it and come into my study? I want to speak to you
about something very serious to us all.'

'Very serious to us all.' Mr. Lennox had never had the opportunity of
having any private conversation with her father after her refusal, or
else that would indeed be a very serious affair. In the first place,
Margaret felt guilty and ashamed of having grown so much into a woman as
to be thought of in marriage; and secondly, she did not know if her
father might not be displeased that she had taken upon herself to
decline Mr. Lennox's proposal. But she soon felt it was not about
anything, which having only lately and suddenly occurred, could have
given rise to any complicated thoughts, that her father wished to speak
to her. He made her take a chair by him; he stirred the fire, snuffed
the candles, and sighed once or twice before he could make up his mind
to say--and it came out with a jerk after all--'Margaret! I am going to
leave Helstone.'

'Leave Helstone, papa! But why?'

Mr. Hale did not answer for a minute or two. He played with some papers
on the table in a nervous and confused manner, opening his lips to speak
several times, but closing them again without having the courage to
utter a word. Margaret could not bear the sight of the suspense, which
was even more distressing to her father than to herself.

'But why, dear papa? Do tell me!'

He looked up at her suddenly, and then said with a slow and enforced
calmness:

'Because I must no longer be a minister in the Church of England.'

Margaret had imagined nothing less than that some of the preferments
which her mother so much desired had befallen her father at
last--something that would force him to leave beautiful, beloved
Helstone, and perhaps compel him to go and live in some of the stately
and silent Closes which Margaret had seen from time to time in cathedral
towns. They were grand and imposing places, but if, to go there, it was
necessary to leave Helstone as a home for ever, that would have been a
sad, long, lingering pain. But nothing to the shock she received from
Mr. Hale's last speech. What could he mean? It was all the worse for
being so mysterious. The aspect of piteous distress on his face, almost
as imploring a merciful and kind judgment from his child, gave her a
sudden sickening. Could he have become implicated in anything Frederick
had done? Frederick was an outlaw. Had her father, out of a natural love
for his son, connived at any--

'Oh! what is it? do speak, papa! tell me all! Why can you no longer be a
clergyman? Surely, if the bishop were told all we know about Frederick,
and the hard, unjust--'

'It is nothing about Frederick; the bishop would have nothing to do with
that. It is all myself. Margaret, I will tell you about it. I will
answer any questions this once, but after to-night let us never speak of
it again. I can meet the consequences of my painful, miserable doubts;
but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has caused me so much
suffering.'

'Doubts, papa! Doubts as to religion?' asked Margaret, more shocked than
ever.

'No! not doubts as to religion; not the slightest injury to that.' He
paused. Margaret sighed, as if standing on the verge of some new horror.
He began again, speaking rapidly, as if to get over a set task:

'You could not understand it all, if I told you--my anxiety, for years
past, to know whether I had any right to hold my living--my efforts to
quench my smouldering doubts by the authority of the Church. Oh!
Margaret, how I love the holy Church from which I am to be shut out!' He
could not go on for a moment or two. Margaret could not tell what to
say; it seemed to her as terribly mysterious as if her father were about
to turn Mahometan.

'I have been reading to-day of the two thousand who were ejected from
their churches,'--continued Mr. Hale, smiling faintly,--'trying to steal
some of their bravery; but it is of no use--no use--I cannot help
feeling it acutely.'

'But, papa, have you well considered? Oh! it seems so terrible, so
shocking,' said Margaret, suddenly bursting into tears. The one staid
foundation of her home, of her idea of her beloved father, seemed
reeling and rocking. What could she say? What was to be done? The sight
of her distress made Mr. Hale nerve himself, in order to try and comfort
her. He swallowed down the dry choking sobs which had been heaving up
from his heart hitherto, and going to his bookcase he took down a
volume, which he had often been reading lately, and from which he
thought he had derived strength to enter upon the course in which he was
now embarked.

'Listen, dear Margaret,' said he, putting one arm round her waist. She
took his hand in hers and grasped it tight, but she could not lift up
her head; nor indeed could she attend to what he read, so great was her
internal agitation.

'This is the soliloquy of one who was once a clergyman in a country
parish, like me; it was written by a Mr. Oldfield, minister of
Carsington, in Derbyshire, a hundred and sixty years ago, or more. His
trials are over. He fought the good fight.' These last two sentences he
spoke low, as if to himself. Then he read aloud,--

'When thou canst no longer continue in thy work without dishonour to
God, discredit to religion, foregoing thy integrity, wounding
conscience, spoiling thy peace, and hazarding the loss of thy salvation;
in a word, when the conditions upon which thou must continue (if thou
wilt continue) in thy employments are sinful, and unwarranted by the
word of God, thou mayest, yea, thou must believe that God will turn thy
very silence, suspension, deprivation, and laying aside, to His glory,
and the advancement of the Gospel's interest. When God will not use thee
in one kind, yet He will in another. A soul that desires to serve and
honour Him shall never want opportunity to do it; nor must thou so limit
the Holy One of Israel as to think He hath but one way in which He can
glorify Himself by thee. He can do it by thy silence as well as by thy
preaching; thy laying aside as well as thy continuance in thy work. It
is not pretence of doing God the greatest service, or performing the
weightiest duty, that will excuse the least sin, though that sin
capacitated or gave us the opportunity for doing that duty. Thou wilt
have little thanks, O my soul! if, when thou art charged with corrupting
God's worship, falsifying thy vows, thou pretendest a necessity for it
in order to a continuance in the ministry. As he read this, and glanced
at much more which he did not read, he gained resolution for himself,
and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed
to be right; but as he ceased he heard Margaret's low convulsive sob;
and his courage sank down under the keen sense of suffering.

'Margaret, dear!' said he, drawing her closer, 'think of the early
martyrs; think of the thousands who have suffered.'

'But, father,' said she, suddenly lifting up her flushed, tear-wet face,
'the early martyrs suffered for the truth, while you--oh! dear, dear
papa!'

'I suffer for conscience' sake, my child,' said he, with a dignity that
was only tremulous from the acute sensitiveness of his character; 'I
must do what my conscience bids. I have borne long with self-reproach
that would have roused any mind less torpid and cowardly than mine.' He
shook his head as he went on. 'Your poor mother's fond wish, gratified
at last in the mocking way in which over-fond wishes are too often
fulfilled--Sodom apples as they are--has brought on this crisis, for
which I ought to be, and I hope I am thankful. It is not a month since
the bishop offered me another living; if I had accepted it, I should
have had to make a fresh declaration of conformity to the Liturgy at my
institution. Margaret, I tried to do it; I tried to content myself with
simply refusing the additional preferment, and stopping quietly
here,--strangling my conscience now, as I had strained it before. God
forgive me!'

He rose and walked up and down the room, speaking low words of
self-reproach and humiliation, of which Margaret was thankful to hear
but few. At last he said,

'Margaret, I return to the old sad burden we must leave Helstone.'

'Yes! I see. But when?'

'I have written to the bishop--I dare say I have told you so, but I
forget things just now,' said Mr. Hale, collapsing into his depressed
manner as soon as he came to talk of hard matter-of-fact details,
'informing him of my intention to resign this vicarage. He has been most
kind; he has used arguments and expostulations, all in vain--in vain.
They are but what I have tried upon myself, without avail. I shall have
to take my deed of resignation, and wait upon the bishop myself, to bid
him farewell. That will be a trial, but worse, far worse, will be the
parting from my dear people. There is a curate appointed to read
prayers--a Mr. Brown. He will come to stay with us to-morrow. Next
Sunday I preach my farewell sermon.'

Was it to be so sudden then? thought Margaret; and yet perhaps it was as
well. Lingering would only add stings to the pain; it was better to be
stunned into numbness by hearing of all these arrangements, which seemed
to be nearly completed before she had been told. 'What does mamma say?'
asked she, with a deep sigh.

To her surprise, her father began to walk about again before he
answered. At length he stopped and replied:

'Margaret, I am a poor coward after all. I cannot bear to give pain. I
know so well your mother's married life has not been all she hoped--all
she had a right to expect--and this will be such a blow to her, that I
have never had the heart, the power to tell her. She must be told
though, now,' said he, looking wistfully at his daughter. Margaret was
almost overpowered with the idea that her mother knew nothing of it all,
and yet the affair was so far advanced!

'Yes, indeed she must,' said Margaret. 'Perhaps, after all, she may
not--Oh yes! she will, she must be shocked'--as the force of the blow
returned upon herself in trying to realise how another would take it.
'Where are we to go to?' said she at last, struck with a fresh wonder as
to their future plans, if plans indeed her father had.

'To Milton-Northern,' he answered, with a dull indifference, for he had
perceived that, although his daughter's love had made her cling to him,
and for a moment strive to soothe him with her love, yet the keenness of
the pain was as fresh as ever in her mind.

'Milton-Northern! The manufacturing town in Darkshire?'

'Yes,' said he, in the same despondent, indifferent way.

'Why there, papa?' asked she.

'Because there I can earn bread for my family. Because I know no one
there, and no one knows Helstone, or can ever talk to me about it.'

'Bread for your family! I thought you and mamma had'--and then she
stopped, checking her natural interest regarding their future life, as
she saw the gathering gloom on her father's brow. But he, with his quick
intuitive sympathy, read in her face, as in a mirror, the reflections of
his own moody depression, and turned it off with an effort.

'You shall be told all, Margaret. Only help me to tell your mother. I
think I could do anything but that: the idea of her distress turns me
sick with dread. If I tell you all, perhaps you could break it to her
to-morrow. I am going out for the day, to bid Farmer Dobson and the poor
people on Bracy Common good-bye. Would you dislike breaking it to her
very much, Margaret?'

Margaret did dislike it, did shrink from it more than from anything she
had ever had to do in her life before. She could not speak, all at once.
Her father said, 'You dislike it very much, don't you, Margaret?' Then
she conquered herself, and said, with a bright strong look on her face:

'It is a painful thing, but it must be done, and I will do it as well as
ever I can. You must have many painful things to do.'

Mr. Hale shook his head despondingly: he pressed her hand in token of
gratitude. Margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of crying. To
turn her thoughts, she said: 'Now tell me, papa, what our plans are. You
and mamma have some money, independent of the income from the living,
have not you? Aunt Shaw has, I know.'

'Yes. I suppose we have about a hundred and seventy pounds a year of our
own. Seventy of that has always gone to Frederick, since he has been
abroad. I don't know if he wants it all,' he continued in a hesitating
manner. 'He must have some pay for serving with the Spanish army.'

'Frederick must not suffer,' said Margaret, decidedly; 'in a foreign
country; so unjustly treated by his own. A hundred is left. Could not
you, and I, and mamma live on a hundred a year in some very cheap--very
quiet part of England? Oh! I think we could.'

'No!' said Mr. Hale. 'That would not answer. I must do something. I must
make myself busy, to keep off morbid thoughts. Besides, in a country
parish I should be so painfully reminded of Helstone, and my duties
here. I could not bear it, Margaret. And a hundred a year would go a
very little way, after the necessary wants of housekeeping are met,
towards providing your mother with all the comforts she has been
accustomed to, and ought to have. No: we must go to Milton. That is
settled. I can always decide better by myself, and not influenced by
those whom I love,' said he, as a half apology for having arranged so
much before he had told any one of his family of his intentions. 'I
cannot stand objections. They make me so undecided.'

Margaret resolved to keep silence. After all, what did it signify where
they went, compared to the one terrible change?

Mr. Hale continued: 'A few months ago, when my misery of doubt became
more than I could bear without speaking, I wrote to Mr. Bell--you
remember Mr. Bell, Margaret?'

'No; I never saw him, I think. But I know who he is. Frederick's
godfather--your old tutor at Oxford, don't you mean?'

'Yes. He is a Fellow of Plymouth College there. He is a native of
Milton-Northern, I believe. At any rate, he has property there, which
has very much increased in value since Milton has become such a large
manufacturing town. Well, I had reason to suspect--to imagine--I had
better say nothing about it, however. But I felt sure of sympathy from
Mr. Bell. I don't know that he gave me much strength. He has lived an
easy life in his college all his days. But he has been as kind as can
be. And it is owing to him we are going to Milton.'

'How?' said Margaret.

'Why he has tenants, and houses, and mills there; so, though he dislikes
the place--too bustling for one of his habits--he is obliged to keep up
some sort of connection; and he tells me that he hears there is a good
opening for a private tutor there.'

'A private tutor!' said Margaret, looking scornful: 'What in the world
do manufacturers want with the classics, or literature, or the
accomplishments of a gentleman?'

'Oh,' said her father, 'some of them really seem to be fine fellows,
conscious of their own deficiencies, which is more than many a man at
Oxford is. Some want resolutely to learn, though they have come to man's
estate. Some want their children to be better instructed than they
themselves have been. At any rate, there is an opening, as I have said,
for a private tutor. Mr. Bell has recommended me to a Mr. Thornton, a
tenant of his, and a very intelligent man, as far as I can judge from
his letters. And in Milton, Margaret, I shall find a busy life, if not a
happy one, and people and scenes so different that I shall never be
reminded of Helstone.'

There was the secret motive, as Margaret knew from her own feelings. It
would be different. Discordant as it was--with almost a detestation for
all she had ever heard of the North of England, the manufacturers, the
people, the wild and bleak country--there was this one
recommendation--it would be different from Helstone, and could never
remind them of that beloved place.

'When do we go?' asked Margaret, after a short silence.

'I do not know exactly. I wanted to talk it over with you. You see, your
mother knows nothing about it yet: but I think, in a fortnight;--after
my deed of resignation is sent in, I shall have no right to remain.

Margaret was almost stunned.

'In a fortnight!'

'No--no, not exactly to a day. Nothing is fixed,' said her father, with
anxious hesitation, as he noticed the filmy sorrow that came over her
eyes, and the sudden change in her complexion. But she recovered herself
immediately.

'Yes, papa, it had better be fixed soon and decidedly, as you say. Only
mamma to know nothing about it! It is that that is the great
perplexity.'

'Poor Maria!' replied Mr. Hale, tenderly. 'Poor, poor Maria! Oh, if I
were not married--if I were but myself in the world, how easy it would
be! As it is--Margaret, I dare not tell her!'

'No,' said Margaret, sadly, 'I will do it. Give me till to-morrow
evening to choose my time Oh, papa,' cried she, with sudden passionate
entreaty, 'say--tell me it is a night-mare--a horrid dream--not the real
waking truth! You cannot mean that you are really going to leave the
Church--to give up Helstone--to be for ever separate from me, from
mamma--led away by some delusion--some temptation! You do not really
mean it!'

Mr. Hale sat in rigid stillness while she spoke.

Then he looked her in the face, and said in a slow, hoarse, measured
way--'I do mean it, Margaret. You must not deceive yourself into
doubting the reality of my words--my fixed intention and resolve.' He
looked at her in the same steady, stony manner, for some moments after
he had done speaking. She, too, gazed back with pleading eyes before she
would believe that it was irrevocable. Then she arose and went, without
another word or look, towards the door. As her fingers were on the
handle he called her back. He was standing by the fireplace, shrunk and
stooping; but as she came near he drew himself up to his full height,
and, placing his hands on her head, he said, solemnly:

'The blessing of God be upon thee, my child!'

'And may He restore you to His Church,' responded she, out of the
fulness of her heart. The next moment she feared lest this answer to his
blessing might be irreverent, wrong--might hurt him as coming from his
daughter, and she threw her arms round his neck. He held her to him for
a minute or two. She heard him murmur to himself, 'The martyrs and
confessors had even more pain to bear--I will not shrink.'

They were startled by hearing Mrs. Hale inquiring for her daughter. They
started asunder in the full consciousness of all that was before them.
Mr. Hale hurriedly said--'Go, Margaret, go. I shall be out all
to-morrow. Before night you will have told your mother.'

'Yes,' she replied, and she returned to the drawing-room in a stunned
and dizzy state.




CHAPTER V

DECISION

    'I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,
     Through constant watching wise,
     To meet the glad with joyful smiles,
     And to wipe the weeping eyes;
     And a heart at leisure from itself
         To soothe and sympathise.'
             ANON.


Margaret made a good listener to all her mother's little plans for
adding some small comforts to the lot of the poorer parishioners. She
could not help listening, though each new project was a stab to her
heart. By the time the frost had set in, they should be far away from
Helstone. Old Simon's rheumatism might be bad and his eyesight worse;
there would be no one to go and read to him, and comfort him with little
porringers of broth and good red flannel: or if there was, it would be a
stranger, and the old man would watch in vain for her. Mary Domville's
little crippled boy would crawl in vain to the door and look for her
coming through the forest. These poor friends would never understand why
she had forsaken them; and there were many others besides. 'Papa has
always spent the income he derived from his living in the parish. I am,
perhaps, encroaching upon the next dues, but the winter is likely to be
severe, and our poor old people must be helped.'

'Oh, mamma, let us do all we can,' said Margaret eagerly, not seeing the
prudential side of the question, only grasping at the idea that they
were rendering such help for the last time; 'we may not be here long.'

'Do you feel ill, my darling?' asked Mrs. Hale, anxiously,
misunderstanding Margaret's hint of the uncertainty of their stay at
Helstone. 'You look pale and tired. It is this soft, damp, unhealthy
air.'

'No--no, mamma, it is not that: it is delicious air. It smells of the
freshest, purest fragrance, after the smokiness of Harley Street. But I
am tired: it surely must be near bedtime.'

'Not far off--it is half-past nine. You had better go to bed at once dear.
Ask Dixon for some gruel. I will come and see you as soon as you are in
bed. I am afraid you have taken cold; or the bad air from some of the
stagnant ponds--'

'Oh, mamma,' said Margaret, faintly smiling as she kissed her mother, 'I
am quite well--don't alarm yourself about me; I am only tired.'

Margaret went upstairs. To soothe her mother's anxiety she submitted to
a basin of gruel. She was lying languidly in bed when Mrs. Hale came up
to make some last inquiries and kiss her before going to her own room
for the night. But the instant she heard her mother's door locked, she
sprang out of bed, and throwing her dressing-gown on, she began to pace
up and down the room, until the creaking of one of the boards reminded
her that she must make no noise. She went and curled herself up on the
window-seat in the small, deeply-recessed window. That morning when she
had looked out, her heart had danced at seeing the bright clear lights
on the church tower, which foretold a fine and sunny day. This
evening--sixteen hours at most had past by--she sat down, too full of
sorrow to cry, but with a dull cold pain, which seemed to have pressed
the youth and buoyancy out of her heart, never to return. Mr. Henry
Lennox's visit--his offer--was like a dream, a thing beside her actual
life. The hard reality was, that her father had so admitted tempting
doubts into his mind as to become a schismatic--an outcast; all the
changes consequent upon this grouped themselves around that one great
blighting fact.

She looked out upon the dark-gray lines of the church tower, square and
straight in the centre of the view, cutting against the deep blue
transparent depths beyond, into which she gazed, and felt that she might
gaze for ever, seeing at every moment some farther distance, and yet no
sign of God! It seemed to her at the moment, as if the earth was more
utterly desolate than if girt in by an iron dome, behind which there
might be the ineffaceable peace and glory of the Almighty: those
never-ending depths of space, in their still serenity, were more mocking
to her than any material bounds could be--shutting in the cries of
earth's sufferers, which now might ascend into that infinite splendour
of vastness and be lost--lost for ever, before they reached His throne.
In this mood her father came in unheard. The moonlight was strong enough
to let him see his daughter in her unusual place and attitude. He came
to her and touched her shoulder before she was aware that he was there.

'Margaret, I heard you were up. I could not help coming in to ask you to
pray with me--to say the Lord's Prayer; that will do good to both of
us.'

Mr. Hale and Margaret knelt by the window-seat--he looking up, she bowed
down in humble shame. God was there, close around them, hearing her
father's whispered words. Her father might be a heretic; but had not
she, in her despairing doubts not five minutes before, shown herself a
far more utter sceptic? She spoke not a word, but stole to bed after her
father had left her, like a child ashamed of its fault. If the world was
full of perplexing problems she would trust, and only ask to see the one
step needful for the hour. Mr. Lennox--his visit, his proposal--the
remembrance of which had been so rudely pushed aside by the subsequent
events of the day--haunted her dreams that night. He was climbing up
some tree of fabulous height to reach the branch whereon was slung her
bonnet: he was falling, and she was struggling to save him, but held
back by some invisible powerful hand. He was dead. And yet, with a
shifting of the scene, she was once more in the Harley Street
drawing-room, talking to him as of old, and still with a consciousness
all the time that she had seen him killed by that terrible fall.

Miserable, unresting night! Ill preparation for the coming day! She
awoke with a start, unrefreshed, and conscious of some reality worse
even than her feverish dreams. It all came back upon her; not merely the
sorrow, but the terrible discord in the sorrow. Where, to what distance
apart, had her father wandered, led by doubts which were to her
temptations of the Evil One? She longed to ask, and yet would not have
heard for all the world.

The fine crisp morning made her mother feel particularly well and happy
at breakfast-time. She talked on, planning village kindnesses, unheeding
the silence of her husband and the monosyllabic answers of Margaret.
Before the things were cleared away, Mr. Hale got up; he leaned one hand
on the table, as if to support himself:

'I shall not be at home till evening. I am going to Bracy Common, and
will ask Farmer Dobson to give me something for dinner. I shall be back
to tea at seven.' He did not look at either of them, but Margaret knew
what he meant. By seven the announcement must be made to her mother. Mr.
Hale would have delayed making it till half-past six, but Margaret was
of different stuff. She could not bear the impending weight on her mind
all the day long: better get the worst over; the day would be too short
to comfort her mother. But while she stood by the window, thinking how
to begin, and waiting for the servant to have left the room, her mother
had gone up-stairs to put on her things to go to the school. She came
down ready equipped, in a brisker mood than usual.

'Mother, come round the garden with me this morning; just one turn,'
said Margaret, putting her arm round Mrs. Hale's waist.

They passed through the open window. Mrs. Hale spoke--said
something--Margaret could not tell what. Her eye caught on a bee
entering a deep-belled flower: when that bee flew forth with his spoil
she would begin--that should be the sign. Out he came.

'Mamma! Papa is going to leave Helstone!' she blurted forth. 'He's going
to leave the Church, and live in Milton-Northern.' There were the three
hard facts hardly spoken.

'What makes you say so?' asked Mrs. Hale, in a surprised incredulous
voice. 'Who has been telling you such nonsense?'

'Papa himself,' said Margaret, longing to say something gentle and
consoling, but literally not knowing how. They were close to a
garden-bench. Mrs. Hale sat down, and began to cry.

'I don't understand you,' she said. 'Either you have made some great
mistake, or I don't quite understand you.'

'No, mother, I have made no mistake. Papa has written to the bishop,
saying that he has such doubts that he cannot conscientiously remain a
priest of the Church of England, and that he must give up Helstone. He
has also consulted Mr. Bell--Frederick's godfather, you know, mamma; and
it is arranged that we go to live in Milton-Northern.' Mrs. Hale looked
up in Margaret's face all the time she was speaking these words: the
shadow on her countenance told that she, at least, believed in the truth
of what she said.

'I don't think it can be true,' said Mrs. Hale, at length. 'He would
surely have told me before it came to this.'

It came strongly upon Margaret's mind that her mother ought to have been
told: that whatever her faults of discontent and repining might have
been, it was an error in her father to have left her to learn his change
of opinion, and his approaching change of life, from her better-informed
child. Margaret sat down by her mother, and took her unresisting head on
her breast, bending her own soft cheeks down caressingly to touch her
face.

'Dear, darling mamma! we were so afraid of giving you pain. Papa felt so
acutely--you know you are not strong, and there must have been such
terrible suspense to go through.'

'When did he tell you, Margaret?'

'Yesterday, only yesterday,' replied Margaret, detecting the jealousy
which prompted the inquiry. 'Poor papa!'--trying to divert her mother's
thoughts into compassionate sympathy for all her father had gone
through. Mrs. Hale raised her head.

'What does he mean by having doubts?' she asked. 'Surely, he does not
mean that he thinks differently--that he knows better than the Church.'
Margaret shook her head, and the tears came into her eyes, as her mother
touched the bare nerve of her own regret.

'Can't the bishop set him right?' asked Mrs. Hale, half impatiently.

'I'm afraid not,' said Margaret. 'But I did not ask. I could not bear to
hear what he might answer. It is all settled at any rate. He is going to
leave Helstone in a fortnight. I am not sure if he did not say he had
sent in his deed of resignation.'

'In a fortnight!' exclaimed Mrs. Hale, 'I do think this is very
strange--not at all right. I call it very unfeeling,' said she,
beginning to take relief in tears. 'He has doubts, you say, and gives up
his living, and all without consulting me. I dare say, if he had told me
his doubts at the first I could have nipped them in the bud.'

Mistaken as Margaret felt her father's conduct to have been, she could
not bear to hear it blamed by her mother. She knew that his very reserve
had originated in a tenderness for her, which might be cowardly, but was
not unfeeling.

'I almost hoped you might have been glad to leave Helstone, mamma,' said
she, after a pause. 'You have never been well in this air, you know.'

'You can't think the smoky air of a manufacturing town, all chimneys and
dirt like Milton-Northern, would be better than this air, which is pure
and sweet, if it is too soft and relaxing. Fancy living in the middle of
factories, and factory people! Though, of course, if your father leaves
the Church, we shall not be admitted into society anywhere. It will be
such a disgrace to us! Poor dear Sir John! It is well he is not alive to
see what your father has come to! Every day after dinner, when I was a
girl, living with your aunt Shaw, at Beresford Court, Sir John used to
give for the first toast--"Church and King, and down with the Rump."'

Margaret was glad that her mother's thoughts were turned away from the
fact of her husband's silence to her on the point which must have been
so near his heart. Next to the serious vital anxiety as to the nature of
her father's doubts, this was the one circumstance of the case that gave
Margaret the most pain.

'You know, we have very little society here, mamma. The Gormans, who are
our nearest neighbours (to call society--and we hardly ever see them),
have been in trade just as much as these Milton-Northern people.'

'Yes,' said Mrs. Hale, almost indignantly, 'but, at any rate, the
Gormans made carriages for half the gentry of the county, and were
brought into some kind of intercourse with them; but these factory
people, who on earth wears cotton that can afford linen?'

'Well, mamma, I give up the cotton-spinners; I am not standing up for
them, any more than for any other trades-people. Only we shall have
little enough to do with them.'

'Why on earth has your father fixed on Milton-Northern to live in?'

'Partly,' said Margaret, sighing, 'because it is so very different from
Helstone--partly because Mr. Bell says there is an opening there for a
private tutor.'

'Private tutor in Milton! Why can't he go to Oxford, and be a tutor to
gentlemen?'

'You forget, mamma! He is leaving the Church on account of his
opinions--his doubts would do him no good at Oxford.'

Mrs. Hale was silent for some time, quietly crying. At last she said:--

'And the furniture--How in the world are we to manage the removal? I
never removed in my life, and only a fortnight to think about it!'

Margaret was inexpressibly relieved to find that her mother's anxiety
and distress was lowered to this point, so insignificant to herself, and
on which she could do so much to help. She planned and promised, and led
her mother on to arrange fully as much as could be fixed before they
knew somewhat more definitively what Mr. Hale intended to do. Throughout
the day Margaret never left her mother; bending her whole soul to
sympathise in all the various turns her feelings took; towards evening
especially, as she became more and more anxious that her father should
find a soothing welcome home awaiting him, after his return from his day
of fatigue and distress. She dwelt upon what he must have borne in
secret for long; her mother only replied coldly that he ought to have
told her, and that then at any rate he would have had an adviser to give
him counsel; and Margaret turned faint at heart when she heard her
father's step in the hall. She dared not go to meet him, and tell him
what she had done all day, for fear of her mother's jealous annoyance.
She heard him linger, as if awaiting her, or some sign of her; and she
dared not stir; she saw by her mother's twitching lips, and changing
colour, that she too was aware that her husband had returned. Presently
he opened the room-door, and stood there uncertain whether to come in.
His face was gray and pale; he had a timid, fearful look in his eyes;
something almost pitiful to see in a man's face; but that look of
despondent uncertainty, of mental and bodily languor, touched his wife's
heart. She went to him, and threw herself on his breast, crying out--

'Oh! Richard, Richard, you should have told me sooner!'

And then, in tears, Margaret left her, as she rushed up-stairs to throw
herself on her bed, and hide her face in the pillows to stifle the
hysteric sobs that would force their way at last, after the rigid
self-control of the whole day. How long she lay thus she could not tell.
She heard no noise, though the housemaid came in to arrange the room.
The affrighted girl stole out again on tip-toe, and went and told Mrs.
Dixon that Miss Hale was crying as if her heart would break: she was
sure she would make herself deadly ill if she went on at that rate. In
consequence of this, Margaret felt herself touched, and started up into
a sitting posture; she saw the accustomed room, the figure of Dixon in
shadow, as the latter stood holding the candle a little behind her, for
fear of the effect on Miss Hale's startled eyes, swollen and blinded as
they were.

'Oh, Dixon! I did not hear you come into the room!' said Margaret,
resuming her trembling self-restraint. 'Is it very late?' continued she,
lifting herself languidly off the bed, yet letting her feet touch the
ground without fairly standing down, as she shaded her wet ruffled hair
off her face, and tried to look as though nothing were the matter; as if
she had only been asleep.

'I hardly can tell what time it is,' replied Dixon, in an aggrieved tone
of voice. 'Since your mamma told me this terrible news, when I dressed
her for tea, I've lost all count of time. I'm sure I don't know what is
to become of us all. When Charlotte told me just now you were sobbing,
Miss Hale, I thought, no wonder, poor thing! And master thinking of
turning Dissenter at his time of life, when, if it is not to be said
he's done well in the Church, he's not done badly after all. I had a
cousin, miss, who turned Methodist preacher after he was fifty years of
age, and a tailor all his life; but then he had never been able to make
a pair of trousers to fit, for as long as he had been in the trade, so
it was no wonder; but for master! as I said to missus, "What would poor
Sir John have said? he never liked your marrying Mr. Hale, but if he
could have known it would have come to this, he would have sworn worse
oaths than ever, if that was possible!"'

Dixon had been so much accustomed to comment upon Mr. Hale's proceedings
to her mistress (who listened to her, or not, as she was in the humour),
that she never noticed Margaret's flashing eye and dilating nostril. To
hear her father talked of in this way by a servant to her face!

'Dixon,' she said, in the low tone she always used when much excited,
which had a sound in it as of some distant turmoil, or threatening storm
breaking far away. 'Dixon! you forget to whom you are speaking.' She
stood upright and firm on her feet now, confronting the waiting-maid,
and fixing her with her steady discerning eye. 'I am Mr. Hale's
daughter. Go! You have made a strange mistake, and one that I am sure
your own good feeling will make you sorry for when you think about it.'

Dixon hung irresolutely about the room for a minute or two. Margaret
repeated, 'You may leave me, Dixon. I wish you to go.' Dixon did not
know whether to resent these decided words or to cry; either course
would have done with her mistress: but, as she said to herself, 'Miss
Margaret has a touch of the old gentleman about her, as well as poor
Master Frederick; I wonder where they get it from?' and she, who would
have resented such words from any one less haughty and determined in
manner, was subdued enough to say, in a half humble, half injured tone:

'Mayn't I unfasten your gown, miss, and do your hair?'

'No! not to-night, thank you.' And Margaret gravely lighted her out of
the room, and bolted the door. From henceforth Dixon obeyed and admired
Margaret. She said it was because she was so like poor Master Frederick;
but the truth was, that Dixon, as do many others, liked to feel herself
ruled by a powerful and decided nature.

Margaret needed all Dixon's help in action, and silence in words; for,
for some time, the latter thought it her duty to show her sense of
affront by saying as little as possible to her young lady; so the energy
came out in doing rather than in speaking. A fortnight was a very short
time to make arrangements for so serious a removal; as Dixon said, 'Any
one but a gentleman--indeed almost any other gentleman--' but catching a
look at Margaret's straight, stern brow just here, she coughed the
remainder of the sentence away, and meekly took the horehound drop that
Margaret offered her, to stop the 'little tickling at my chest, miss.'
But almost any one but Mr. Hale would have had practical knowledge
enough to see, that in so short a time it would be difficult to fix on
any house in Milton-Northern, or indeed elsewhere, to which they could
remove the furniture that had of necessity to be taken out of Helstone
vicarage. Mrs. Hale, overpowered by all the troubles and necessities for
immediate household decisions that seemed to come upon her at once,
became really ill, and Margaret almost felt it as a relief when her
mother fairly took to her bed, and left the management of affairs to
her. Dixon, true to her post of body-guard, attended most faithfully to
her mistress, and only emerged from Mrs. Hale's bed-room to shake her
head, and murmur to herself in a manner which Margaret did not choose to
hear. For, the one thing clear and straight before her, was the
necessity for leaving Helstone. Mr. Hale's successor in the living was
appointed; and, at any rate, after her father's decision; there must be
no lingering now, for his sake, as well as from every other
consideration. For he came home every evening more and more depressed,
after the necessary leave-taking which he had resolved to have with
every individual parishioner. Margaret, inexperienced as she was in all
the necessary matter-of-fact business to be got through, did not know to
whom to apply for advice. The cook and Charlotte worked away with
willing arms and stout hearts at all the moving and packing; and as far
as that went, Margaret's admirable sense enabled her to see what was
best, and to direct how it should be done. But where were they to go to?
In a week they must be gone. Straight to Milton, or where? So many
arrangements depended on this decision that Margaret resolved to ask her
father one evening, in spite of his evident fatigue and low spirits. He
answered:

'My dear! I have really had too much to think about to settle this. What
does your mother say? What does she wish? Poor Maria!'

He met with an echo even louder than his sigh. Dixon had just come into
the room for another cup of tea for Mrs. Hale, and catching Mr. Hale's
last words, and protected by his presence from Margaret's upbraiding
eyes, made bold to say, 'My poor mistress!'

'You don't think her worse to-day,' said Mr. Hale, turning hastily.

'I'm sure I can't say, sir. It's not for me to judge. The illness seems
so much more on the mind than on the body.'

Mr. Hale looked infinitely distressed.

'You had better take mamma her tea while it is hot, Dixon,' said
Margaret, in a tone of quiet authority.

'Oh! I beg your pardon, miss! My thoughts was otherwise occupied in
thinking of my poor---- of Mrs. Hale.'

'Papa!' said Margaret, 'it is this suspense that is bad for you both. Of
course, mamma must feel your change of opinions: we can't help that,'
she continued, softly; 'but now the course is clear, at least to a
certain point. And I think, papa, that I could get mamma to help me in
planning, if you could tell me what to plan for. She has never expressed
any wish in any way, and only thinks of what can't be helped. Are we to
go straight to Milton? Have you taken a house there?'

'No,' he replied. 'I suppose we must go into lodgings, and look about
for a house.

'And pack up the furniture so that it can be left at the railway
station, till we have met with one?'

'I suppose so. Do what you think best. Only remember, we shall have much
less money to spend.'

They had never had much superfluity, as Margaret knew. She felt that it
was a great weight suddenly thrown upon her shoulders. Four months ago,
all the decisions she needed to make were what dress she would wear for
dinner, and to help Edith to draw out the lists of who should take down
whom in the dinner parties at home. Nor was the household in which she
lived one that called for much decision. Except in the one grand case of
Captain Lennox's offer, everything went on with the regularity of
clockwork. Once a year, there was a long discussion between her aunt and
Edith as to whether they should go to the Isle of Wight, abroad, or to
Scotland; but at such times Margaret herself was secure of drifting,
without any exertion of her own, into the quiet harbour of home. Now,
since that day when Mr. Lennox came, and startled her into a decision,
every day brought some question, momentous to her, and to those whom she
loved, to be settled.

Her father went up after tea to sit with his wife. Margaret remained
alone in the drawing-room. Suddenly she took a candle and went into her
father's study for a great atlas, and lugging it back into the
drawing-room, she began to pore over the map of England. She was ready
to look up brightly when her father came down stairs.

'I have hit upon such a beautiful plan. Look here--in Darkshire, hardly
the breadth of my finger from Milton, is Heston, which I have often
heard of from people living in the north as such a pleasant little
bathing-place. Now, don't you think we could get mamma there with Dixon,
while you and I go and look at houses, and get one all ready for her in
Milton? She would get a breath of sea air to set her up for the winter,
and be spared all the fatigue, and Dixon would enjoy taking care of
her.'

'Is Dixon to go with us?' asked Mr. Hale, in a kind of helpless dismay.

'Oh, yes!' said Margaret. 'Dixon quite intends it, and I don't know what
mamma would do without her.'

'But we shall have to put up with a very different way of living, I am
afraid. Everything is so much dearer in a town. I doubt if Dixon can
make herself comfortable. To tell you the truth Margaret, I sometimes
feel as if that woman gave herself airs.'

'To be sure she does, papa,' replied Margaret; 'and if she has to put up
with a different style of living, we shall have to put up with her airs,
which will be worse. But she really loves us all, and would be miserable
to leave us, I am sure--especially in this change; so, for mamma's sake,
and for the sake of her faithfulness, I do think she must go.'

'Very well, my dear. Go on. I am resigned. How far is Heston from
Milton? The breadth of one of your fingers does not give me a very clear
idea of distance.'

'Well, then, I suppose it is thirty miles; that is not much!'

'Not in distance, but in--. Never mind! If you really think it will do
your mother good, let it be fixed so.'

This was a great step. Now Margaret could work, and act, and plan in
good earnest. And now Mrs. Hale could rouse herself from her languor,
and forget her real suffering in thinking of the pleasure and the
delight of going to the sea-side. Her only regret was that Mr. Hale
could not be with her all the fortnight she was to be there, as he had
been for a whole fortnight once, when they were engaged, and she was
staying with Sir John and Lady Beresford at Torquay.




CHAPTER VI

FAREWELL

    'Unwatch'd the garden bough shall sway,
     The tender blossom flutter down,
     Unloved that beech will gather brown,
     The maple burn itself away;

     Unloved, the sun-flower, shining fair,
     Ray round with flames her disk of seed,
     And many a rose-carnation feed
     With summer spice the humming air;

               * * * * * *

     Till from the garden and the wild
     A fresh association blow,
     And year by year the landscape grow
     Familiar to the stranger's child;

     As year by year the labourer tills
     His wonted glebe, or lops the glades;
     And year by year our memory fades
     From all the circle of the hills.'
             TENNYSON.


The last day came; the house was full of packing-cases, which were being
carted off at the front door, to the nearest railway station. Even the
pretty lawn at the side of the house was made unsightly and untidy by
the straw that had been wafted upon it through the open door and
windows. The rooms had a strange echoing sound in them,--and the light
came harshly and strongly in through the uncurtained windows,--seeming
already unfamiliar and strange. Mrs. Hale's dressing-room was left
untouched to the last; and there she and Dixon were packing up clothes,
and interrupting each other every now and then to exclaim at, and turn
over with fond regard, some forgotten treasure, in the shape of some
relic of the children while they were yet little. They did not make much
progress with their work. Down-stairs, Margaret stood calm and
collected, ready to counsel or advise the men who had been called in to
help the cook and Charlotte. These two last, crying between whiles,
wondered how the young lady could keep up so this last day, and settled
it between them that she was not likely to care much for Helstone,
having been so long in London. There she stood, very pale and quiet,
with her large grave eyes observing everything,--up to every present
circumstance, however small. They could not understand how her heart was
aching all the time, with a heavy pressure that no sighs could lift off
or relieve, and how constant exertion for her perceptive faculties was
the only way to keep herself from crying out with pain. Moreover, if she
gave way, who was to act? Her father was examining papers, books,
registers, what not, in the vestry with the clerk; and when he came in,
there were his own books to pack up, which no one but himself could do
to his satisfaction. Besides, was Margaret one to give way before
strange men, or even household friends like the cook and Charlotte! Not
she. But at last the four packers went into the kitchen to their tea;
and Margaret moved stiffly and slowly away from the place in the hall
where she had been standing so long, out through the bare echoing
drawing-room, into the twilight of an early November evening. There was
a filmy veil of soft dull mist obscuring, but not hiding, all objects,
giving them a lilac hue, for the sun had not yet fully set; a robin was
singing,--perhaps, Margaret thought, the very robin that her father had
so often talked of as his winter pet, and for which he had made, with
his own hands, a kind of robin-house by his study-window. The leaves
were more gorgeous than ever; the first touch of frost would lay them
all low on the ground. Already one or two kept constantly floating down,
amber and golden in the low slanting sun-rays.

Margaret went along the walk under the pear-tree wall. She had never
been along it since she paced it at Henry Lennox's side. Here, at this
bed of thyme, he began to speak of what she must not think of now. Her
eyes were on that late-blowing rose as she was trying to answer; and she
had caught the idea of the vivid beauty of the feathery leaves of the
carrots in the very middle of his last sentence. Only a fortnight ago!
And all so changed! Where was he now? In London,--going through the old
round; dining with the old Harley Street set, or with gayer young
friends of his own. Even now, while she walked sadly through that damp
and drear garden in the dusk, with everything falling and fading, and
turning to decay around her, he might be gladly putting away his
law-books after a day of satisfactory toil, and freshening himself up,
as he had told her he often did, by a run in the Temple Gardens, taking
in the while the grand inarticulate mighty roar of tens of thousands of
busy men, nigh at hand, but not seen, and catching ever, at his quick
turns, glimpses of the lights of the city coming up out of the depths of
the river. He had often spoken to Margaret of these hasty walks,
snatched in the intervals between study and dinner. At his best times
and in his best moods had he spoken of them; and the thought of them had
struck upon her fancy. Here there was no sound. The robin had gone away
into the vast stillness of night. Now and then, a cottage door in the
distance was opened and shut, as if to admit the tired labourer to his
home; but that sounded very far away. A stealthy, creeping, cranching
sound among the crisp fallen leaves of the forest, beyond the garden,
seemed almost close at hand. Margaret knew it was some poacher. Sitting
up in her bed-room this past autumn, with the light of her candle
extinguished, and purely revelling in the solemn beauty of the heavens
and the earth, she had many a time seen the light noiseless leap of the
poachers over the garden-fence, their quick tramp across the dewy
moonlit lawn, their disappearance in the black still shadow beyond. The
wild adventurous freedom of their life had taken her fancy; she felt
inclined to wish them success; she had no fear of them. But to-night she
was afraid, she knew not why. She heard Charlotte shutting the windows,
and fastening up for the night, unconscious that any one had gone out
into the garden. A small branch--it might be of rotten wood, or it might
be broken by force--came heavily down in the nearest part of the forest,
Margaret ran, swift as Camilla, down to the window, and rapped at it
with a hurried tremulousness which startled Charlotte within.

'Let me in! Let me in! It is only me, Charlotte!' Her heart did not
still its fluttering till she was safe in the drawing-room, with the
windows fastened and bolted, and the familiar walls hemming her round,
and shutting her in. She had sate down upon a packing case; cheerless,
Chill was the dreary and dismantled room--no fire nor other light, but
Charlotte's long unsnuffed candle. Charlotte looked at Margaret with
surprise; and Margaret, feeling it rather than seeing it, rose up.

'I was afraid you were shutting me out altogether, Charlotte,' said she,
half-smiling. 'And then you would never have heard me in the kitchen,
and the doors into the lane and churchyard are locked long ago.'

'Oh, miss, I should have been sure to have missed you soon. The men
would have wanted you to tell them how to go on. And I have put tea in
master's study, as being the most comfortable room, so to speak.'

'Thank you, Charlotte. You are a kind girl. I shall be sorry to leave
you. You must try and write to me, if I can ever give you any little
help or good advice. I shall always be glad to get a letter from
Helstone, you know. I shall be sure and send you my address when I know
it.'

The study was all ready for tea. There was a good blazing fire, and
unlighted candles on the table. Margaret sat down on the rug, partly to
warm herself, for the dampness of the evening hung about her dress, and
over-fatigue had made her chilly. She kept herself balanced by clasping
her hands together round her knees; her head dropped a little towards
her chest; the attitude was one of despondency, whatever her frame of
mind might be. But when she heard her father's step on the gravel
outside, she started up, and hastily shaking her heavy black hair back,
and wiping a few tears away that had come on her cheeks she knew not
how, she went out to open the door for him. He showed far more
depression than she did. She could hardly get him to talk, although she
tried to speak on subjects that would interest him, at the cost of an
effort every time which she thought would be her last.

'Have you been a very long walk to-day?' asked she, on seeing his
refusal to touch food of any kind.

'As far as Fordham Beeches. I went to see Widow Maltby; she is sadly
grieved at not having wished you good-bye. She says little Susan has
kept watch down the lane for days past.--Nay, Margaret, what is the
matter, dear?' The thought of the little child watching for her, and
continually disappointed--from no forgetfulness on her part, but from
sheer inability to leave home--was the last drop in poor Margaret's cup,
and she was sobbing away as if her heart would break. Mr. Hale was
distressingly perplexed. He rose, and walked nervously up and down the
room. Margaret tried to check herself, but would not speak until she
could do so with firmness. She heard him talking, as if to himself.

'I cannot bear it. I cannot bear to see the sufferings of others. I
think I could go through my own with patience. Oh, is there no going
back?'

'No, father,' said Margaret, looking straight at him, and speaking low
and steadily. 'It is bad to believe you in error. It would be infinitely
worse to have known you a hypocrite.' She dropped her voice at the last
few words, as if entertaining the idea of hypocrisy for a moment in
connection with her father savoured of irreverence.

'Besides,' she went on, 'it is only that I am tired to-night; don't
think that I am suffering from what you have done, dear papa. We can't
either of us talk about it to-night, I believe,' said she, finding that
tears and sobs would come in spite of herself. 'I had better go and take
mamma up this cup of tea. She had hers very early, when I was too busy
to go to her, and I am sure she will be glad of another now.'

Railroad time inexorably wrenched them away from lovely, beloved
Helstone, the next morning. They were gone; they had seen the last of
the long low parsonage home, half-covered with China-roses and
pyracanthus--more homelike than ever in the morning sun that glittered
on its windows, each belonging to some well-loved room. Almost before
they had settled themselves into the car, sent from Southampton to fetch
them to the station, they were gone away to return no more. A sting at
Margaret's heart made her strive to look out to catch the last glimpse
of the old church tower at the turn where she knew it might be seen
above a wave of the forest trees; but her father remembered this too,
and she silently acknowledged his greater right to the one window from
which it could be seen. She leant back and shut her eyes, and the tears
welled forth, and hung glittering for an instant on the shadowing
eye-lashes before rolling slowly down her cheeks, and dropping,
unheeded, on her dress.

They were to stop in London all night at some quiet hotel. Poor Mrs.
Hale had cried in her way nearly all day long; and Dixon showed her
sorrow by extreme crossness, and a continual irritable attempt to keep
her petticoats from even touching the unconscious Mr. Hale, whom she
regarded as the origin of all this suffering.

They went through the well-known streets, past houses which they had
often visited, past shops in which she had lounged, impatient, by her
aunt's side, while that lady was making some important and interminable
decision-nay, absolutely past acquaintances in the streets; for though
the morning had been of an incalculable length to them, and they felt as
if it ought long ago to have closed in for the repose of darkness, it
was the very busiest time of a London afternoon in November when they
arrived there. It was long since Mrs. Hale had been in London; and she
roused up, almost like a child, to look about her at the different
streets, and to gaze after and exclaim at the shops and carriages.

'Oh, there's Harrison's, where I bought so many of my wedding-things.
Dear! how altered! They've got immense plate-glass windows, larger than
Crawford's in Southampton. Oh, and there, I declare--no, it is not--yes,
it is--Margaret, we have just passed Mr. Henry Lennox. Where can he be
going, among all these shops?'

Margaret started forwards, and as quickly fell back, half-smiling at
herself for the sudden motion. They were a hundred yards away by this
time; but he seemed like a relic of Helstone--he was associated with a
bright morning, an eventful day, and she should have liked to have seen
him, without his seeing her,--without the chance of their speaking.

The evening, without employment, passed in a room high up in an hotel,
was long and heavy. Mr. Hale went out to his bookseller's, and to call
on a friend or two. Every one they saw, either in the house or out in
the streets, appeared hurrying to some appointment, expected by, or
expecting somebody. They alone seemed strange and friendless, and
desolate. Yet within a mile, Margaret knew of house after house, where
she for her own sake, and her mother for her aunt Shaw's, would be
welcomed, if they came in gladness, or even in peace of mind. If they
came sorrowing, and wanting sympathy in a complicated trouble like the
present, then they would be felt as a shadow in all these houses of
intimate acquaintances, not friends. London life is too whirling and
full to admit of even an hour of that deep silence of feeling which the
friends of Job showed, when 'they sat with him on the ground seven days
and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him; for they saw that his
grief was very great.'




CHAPTER VII

NEW SCENES AND FACES

    'Mist clogs the sunshine,
     Smoky dwarf houses
     Have we round on every side.'
             MATTHEW ARNOLD.


The next afternoon, about twenty miles from Milton-Northern, they
entered on the little branch railway that led to Heston. Heston itself
was one long straggling street, running parallel to the seashore. It had
a character of its own, as different from the little bathing-places in
the south of England as they again from those of the continent. To use a
Scotch word, every thing looked more 'purposelike.' The country carts
had more iron, and less wood and leather about the horse-gear; the
people in the streets, although on pleasure bent, had yet a busy mind.
The colours looked grayer--more enduring, not so gay and pretty. There
were no smock-frocks, even among the country folk; they retarded motion,
and were apt to catch on machinery, and so the habit of wearing them had
died out. In such towns in the south of England, Margaret had seen the
shopmen, when not employed in their business, lounging a little at their
doors, enjoying the fresh air, and the look up and down the street.
Here, if they had any leisure from customers, they made themselves
business in the shop--even, Margaret fancied, to the unnecessary
unrolling and rerolling of ribbons. All these differences struck upon
her mind, as she and her mother went out next morning to look for
lodgings.

Their two nights at hotels had cost more than Mr. Hale had anticipated,
and they were glad to take the first clean, cheerful rooms they met with
that were at liberty to receive them. There, for the first time for many
days, did Margaret feel at rest. There was a dreaminess in the rest,
too, which made it still more perfect and luxurious to repose in. The
distant sea, lapping the sandy shore with measured sound; the nearer
cries of the donkey-boys; the unusual scenes moving before her like
pictures, which she cared not in her laziness to have fully explained
before they passed away; the stroll down to the beach to breathe the
sea-air, soft and warm on that sandy shore even to the end of November;
the great long misty sea-line touching the tender-coloured sky; the
white sail of a distant boat turning silver in some pale sunbeam:--it
seemed as if she could dream her life away in such luxury of
pensiveness, in which she made her present all in all, from not daring
to think of the past, or wishing to contemplate the future.

But the future must be met, however stern and iron it be. One evening it
was arranged that Margaret and her father should go the next day to
Milton-Northern, and look out for a house. Mr. Hale had received several
letters from Mr. Bell, and one or two from Mr. Thornton, and he was
anxious to ascertain at once a good many particulars respecting his
position and chances of success there, which he could only do by an
interview with the latter gentleman. Margaret knew that they ought to be
removing; but she had a repugnance to the idea of a manufacturing town,
and believed that her mother was receiving benefit from Heston air, so
she would willingly have deferred the expedition to Milton.

For several miles before they reached Milton, they saw a deep
lead-coloured cloud hanging over the horizon in the direction in which
it lay. It was all the darker from contrast with the pale gray-blue of
the wintry sky; for in Heston there had been the earliest signs of
frost. Nearer to the town, the air had a faint taste and smell of smoke;
perhaps, after all, more a loss of the fragrance of grass and herbage
than any positive taste or smell. Quick they were whirled over long,
straight, hopeless streets of regularly-built houses, all small and of
brick. Here and there a great oblong many-windowed factory stood up,
like a hen among her chickens, puffing out black 'unparliamentary'
smoke, and sufficiently accounting for the cloud which Margaret had
taken to foretell rain. As they drove through the larger and wider
streets, from the station to the hotel, they had to stop constantly;
great loaded lorries blocked up the not over-wide thoroughfares.
Margaret had now and then been into the city in her drives with her
aunt. But there the heavy lumbering vehicles seemed various in their
purposes and intent; here every van, every waggon and truck, bore
cotton, either in the raw shape in bags, or the woven shape in bales of
calico. People thronged the footpaths, most of them well-dressed as
regarded the material, but with a slovenly looseness which struck
Margaret as different from the shabby, threadbare smartness of a similar
class in London.

'New Street,' said Mr. Hale. 'This, I believe, is the principal street
in Milton. Bell has often spoken to me about it. It was the opening of
this street from a lane into a great thoroughfare, thirty years ago,
which has caused his property to rise so much in value. Mr. Thornton's
mill must be somewhere not very far off, for he is Mr. Bell's tenant.
But I fancy he dates from his warehouse.'

'Where is our hotel, papa?'

'Close to the end of this street, I believe. Shall we have lunch before
or after we have looked at the houses we marked in the Milton Times?'

'Oh, let us get our work done first.'

'Very well. Then I will only see if there is any note or letter for me
from Mr. Thornton, who said he would let me know anything he might hear
about these houses, and then we will set off. We will keep the cab; it
will be safer than losing ourselves, and being too late for the train
this afternoon.'

There were no letters awaiting him. They set out on their house-hunting.
Thirty pounds a-year was all they could afford to give, but in Hampshire
they could have met with a roomy house and pleasant garden for the
money. Here, even the necessary accommodation of two sitting-rooms and
four bed-rooms seemed unattainable. They went through their list,
rejecting each as they visited it. Then they looked at each other in
dismay.

'We must go back to the second, I think. That one,--in Crampton, don't
they call the suburb? There were three sitting-rooms; don't you remember
how we laughed at the number compared with the three bed-rooms? But I
have planned it all. The front room down-stairs is to be your study and
our dining-room (poor papa!), for, you know, we settled mamma is to have
as cheerful a sitting-room as we can get; and that front room up-stairs,
with the atrocious blue and pink paper and heavy cornice, had really a
pretty view over the plain, with a great bend of river, or canal, or
whatever it is, down below. Then I could have the little bed-room
behind, in that projection at the head of the first flight of
stairs--over the kitchen, you know--and you and mamma the room behind
the drawing-room, and that closet in the roof will make you a splendid
dressing-room.'

'But Dixon, and the girl we are to have to help?'

'Oh, wait a minute. I am overpowered by the discovery of my own genius
for management. Dixon is to have--let me see, I had it once--the back
sitting-room. I think she will like that. She grumbles so much about the
stairs at Heston; and the girl is to have that sloping attic over your
room and mamma's. Won't that do?'

'I dare say it will. But the papers. What taste! And the overloading
such a house with colour and such heavy cornices!'

'Never mind, papa! Surely, you can charm the landlord into re-papering
one or two of the rooms--the drawing-room and your bed-room--for mamma
will come most in contact with them; and your book-shelves will hide a
great deal of that gaudy pattern in the dining-room.'

'Then you think it the best? If so, I had better go at once and call on
this Mr. Donkin, to whom the advertisement refers me. I will take you
back to the hotel, where you can order lunch, and rest, and by the time
it is ready, I shall be with you. I hope I shall be able to get new
papers.'

Margaret hoped so too, though she said nothing. She had never come
fairly in contact with the taste that loves ornament, however bad, more
than the plainness and simplicity which are of themselves the framework
of elegance. Her father took her through the entrance of the hotel, and
leaving her at the foot of the staircase, went to the address of the
landlord of the house they had fixed upon. Just as Margaret had her hand
on the door of their sitting-room, she was followed by a quick-stepping
waiter:

'I beg your pardon, ma'am. The gentleman was gone so quickly, I had no
time to tell him. Mr. Thornton called almost directly after you left;
and, as I understood from what the gentleman said, you would be back in
an hour, I told him so, and he came again about five minutes ago, and
said he would wait for Mr. Hale. He is in your room now, ma'am.'

'Thank you. My father will return soon, and then you can tell him.'
Margaret opened the door and went in with the straight, fearless,
dignified presence habitual to her. She felt no awkwardness; she had too
much the habits of society for that. Here was a person come on business
to her father; and, as he was one who had shown himself obliging, she
was disposed to treat him with a full measure of civility. Mr. Thornton
was a good deal more surprised and discomfited than she. Instead of a
quiet, middle-aged clergyman, a young lady came forward with frank
dignity,--a young lady of a different type to most of those he was in
the habit of seeing. Her dress was very plain: a close straw bonnet of
the best material and shape, trimmed with white ribbon; a dark silk
gown, without any trimming or flounce; a large Indian shawl, which hung
about her in long heavy folds, and which she wore as an empress wears
her drapery. He did not understand who she was, as he caught the simple,
straight, unabashed look, which showed that his being there was of no
concern to the beautiful countenance, and called up no flush of surprise
to the pale ivory of the complexion. He had heard that Mr. Hale had a
daughter, but he had imagined that she was a little girl.

'Mr. Thornton, I believe!' said Margaret, after a half-instant's pause,
during which his unready words would not come. 'Will you sit down. My
father brought me to the door, not a minute ago, but unfortunately he
was not told that you were here, and he has gone away on some business.
But he will come back almost directly. I am sorry you have had the
trouble of calling twice.'

Mr. Thornton was in habits of authority himself, but she seemed to
assume some kind of rule over him at once. He had been getting impatient
at the loss of his time on a market-day, the moment before she appeared,
yet now he calmly took a seat at her bidding.

'Do you know where it is that Mr. Hale has gone to? Perhaps I might be
able to find him.'

'He has gone to a Mr. Donkin's in Canute Street. He is the land-lord of
the house my father wishes to take in Crampton.'

Mr. Thornton knew the house. He had seen the advertisement, and been to
look at it, in compliance with a request of Mr. Bell's that he would
assist Mr. Hale to the best of his power: and also instigated by his own
interest in the case of a clergyman who had given up his living under
circumstances such as those of Mr. Hale. Mr. Thornton had thought that
the house in Crampton was really just the thing; but now that he saw
Margaret, with her superb ways of moving and looking, he began to feel
ashamed of having imagined that it would do very well for the Hales, in
spite of a certain vulgarity in it which had struck him at the time of
his looking it over.

Margaret could not help her looks; but the short curled upper lip, the
round, massive up-turned chin, the manner of carrying her head, her
movements, full of a soft feminine defiance, always gave strangers the
impression of haughtiness. She was tired now, and would rather have
remained silent, and taken the rest her father had planned for her; but,
of course, she owed it to herself to be a gentlewoman, and to speak
courteously from time to time to this stranger; not over-brushed, nor
over-polished, it must be confessed, after his rough encounter with
Milton streets and crowds. She wished that he would go, as he had once
spoken of doing, instead of sitting there, answering with curt sentences
all the remarks she made. She had taken off her shawl, and hung it over
the back of her chair. She sat facing him and facing the light; her full
beauty met his eye; her round white flexile throat rising out of the
full, yet lithe figure; her lips, moving so slightly as she spoke, not
breaking the cold serene look of her face with any variation from the
one lovely haughty curve; her eyes, with their soft gloom, meeting his
with quiet maiden freedom. He almost said to himself that he did not
like her, before their conversation ended; he tried so to compensate
himself for the mortified feeling, that while he looked upon her with an
admiration he could not repress, she looked at him with proud
indifference, taking him, he thought, for what, in his irritation, he
told himself he was--a great rough fellow, with not a grace or a
refinement about him. Her quiet coldness of demeanour he interpreted
into contemptuousness, and resented it in his heart to the pitch of
almost inclining him to get up and go away, and have nothing more to do
with these Hales, and their superciliousness.

Just as Margaret had exhausted her last subject of conversation--and yet
conversation that could hardly be called which consisted of so few and
such short speeches--her father came in, and with his pleasant
gentlemanly courteousness of apology, reinstated his name and family in
Mr. Thornton's good opinion.

Mr. Hale and his visitor had a good deal to say respecting their mutual
friend, Mr. Bell; and Margaret, glad that her part of entertaining the
visitor was over, went to the window to try and make herself more
familiar with the strange aspect of the street. She got so much absorbed
in watching what was going on outside that she hardly heard her father
when he spoke to her, and he had to repeat what he said:

'Margaret! the landlord will persist in admiring that hideous paper, and
I am afraid we must let it remain.'

'Oh dear! I am sorry!' she replied, and began to turn over in her mind
the possibility of hiding part of it, at least, by some of her sketches,
but gave up the idea at last, as likely only to make bad worse. Her
father, meanwhile, with his kindly country hospitality, was pressing Mr.
Thornton to stay to luncheon with them. It would have been very
inconvenient to him to do so, yet he felt that he should have yielded,
if Margaret by word or look had seconded her father's invitation; he was
glad she did not, and yet he was irritated at her for not doing it. She
gave him a low, grave bow when he left, and he felt more awkward and
self-conscious in every limb than he had ever done in all his life
before.

'Well, Margaret, now to luncheon, as fast we can. Have you ordered it?'

'No, papa; that man was here when I came home, and I have never had an
opportunity.'

'Then we must take anything we can get. He must have been waiting a long
time, I'm afraid.'

'It seemed exceedingly long to me. I was just at the last gasp when you
came in. He never went on with any subject, but gave little, short,
abrupt answers.'

'Very much to the point though, I should think. He is a clearheaded
fellow. He said (did you hear?) that Crampton is on gravelly soil, and
by far the most healthy suburb in the neighbourhood of Milton.'

When they returned to Heston, there was the day's account to be given to
Mrs. Hale, who was full of questions which they answered in the
intervals of tea-drinking.

'And what is your correspondent, Mr. Thornton, like?'

'Ask Margaret,' said her husband. 'She and he had a long attempt at
conversation, while I was away speaking to the landlord.'

'Oh! I hardly know what he is like,' said Margaret, lazily; too tired to
tax her powers of description much. And then rousing herself, she said,
'He is a tall, broad-shouldered man, about--how old, papa?'

'I should guess about thirty.'

'About thirty--with a face that is neither exactly plain, nor yet
handsome, nothing remarkable--not quite a gentleman; but that was hardly
to be expected.'

'Not vulgar, or common though,' put in her father, rather jealous of any
disparagement of the sole friend he had in Milton.

'Oh no!' said Margaret. 'With such an expression of resolution and
power, no face, however plain in feature, could be either vulgar or
common. I should not like to have to bargain with him; he looks very
inflexible. Altogether a man who seems made for his niche, mamma;
sagacious, and strong, as becomes a great tradesman.'

'Don't call the Milton manufacturers tradesmen, Margaret,' said her
father. 'They are very different.'

'Are they? I apply the word to all who have something tangible to sell;
but if you think the term is not correct, papa, I won't use it. But, oh
mamma! speaking of vulgarity and commonness, you must prepare yourself
for our drawing-room paper. Pink and blue roses, with yellow leaves! And
such a heavy cornice round the room!'

But when they removed to their new house in Milton, the obnoxious papers
were gone. The landlord received their thanks very composedly; and let
them think, if they liked, that he had relented from his expressed
determination not to repaper. There was no particular need to tell them,
that what he did not care to do for a Reverend Mr. Hale, unknown in
Milton, he was only too glad to do at the one short sharp remonstrance
of Mr. Thornton, the wealthy manufacturer.




CHAPTER VIII

HOME SICKNESS

    'And it's hame, hame; hame,
     Hame fain wad I be.'


It needed the pretty light papering of the rooms to reconcile them to
Milton. It needed more--more that could not be had. The thick yellow
November fogs had come on; and the view of the plain in the valley, made
by the sweeping bend of the river, was all shut out when Mrs. Hale
arrived at her new home.

Margaret and Dixon had been at work for two days, unpacking and
arranging, but everything inside the house still looked in disorder; and
outside a thick fog crept up to the very windows, and was driven in to
every open door in choking white wreaths of unwholesome mist.

'Oh, Margaret! are we to live here?' asked Mrs. Hale in blank dismay.
Margaret's heart echoed the dreariness of the tone in which this
question was put. She could scarcely command herself enough to say, 'Oh,
the fogs in London are sometimes far worse!'

'But then you knew that London itself, and friends lay behind it.
Here--well! we are desolate. Oh Dixon, what a place this is!'

'Indeed, ma'am, I'm sure it will be your death before long, and then I
know who'll--stay! Miss Hale, that's far too heavy for you to lift.'

'Not at all, thank you, Dixon,' replied Margaret, coldly. 'The best
thing we can do for mamma is to get her room quite ready for her to go
to bed, while I go and bring her a cup of coffee.'

Mr. Hale was equally out of spirits, and equally came upon Margaret for
sympathy.

'Margaret, I do believe this is an unhealthy place. Only suppose that
your mother's health or yours should suffer. I wish I had gone into some
country place in Wales; this is really terrible,' said he, going up to
the window. There was no comfort to be given. They were settled in
Milton, and must endure smoke and fogs for a season; indeed, all other
life seemed shut out from them by as thick a fog of circumstance. Only
the day before, Mr. Hale had been reckoning up with dismay how much
their removal and fortnight at Heston had cost, and he found it had
absorbed nearly all his little stock of ready money. No! here they were,
and here they must remain.

At night when Margaret realised this, she felt inclined to sit down in a
stupor of despair. The heavy smoky air hung about her bedroom, which
occupied the long narrow projection at the back of the house. The
window, placed at the side of the oblong, looked to the blank wall of a
similar projection, not above ten feet distant. It loomed through the
fog like a great barrier to hope. Inside the room everything was in
confusion. All their efforts had been directed to make her mother's room
comfortable. Margaret sat down on a box, the direction card upon which
struck her as having been written at Helstone--beautiful, beloved
Helstone! She lost herself in dismal thought: but at last she determined
to take her mind away from the present; and suddenly remembered that she
had a letter from Edith which she had only half read in the bustle of
the morning. It was to tell of their arrival at Corfu; their voyage
along the Mediterranean--their music, and dancing on board ship; the gay
new life opening upon her; her house with its trellised balcony, and its
views over white cliffs and deep blue sea. Edith wrote fluently and
well, if not graphically. She could not only seize the salient and
characteristic points of a scene, but she could enumerate enough of
indiscriminate particulars for Margaret to make it out for herself.
Captain Lennox and another lately married officer shared a villa, high
up on the beautiful precipitous rocks overhanging the sea. Their days,
late as it was in the year, seemed spent in boating or land pic-nics;
all out-of-doors, pleasure-seeking and glad, Edith's life seemed like
the deep vault of blue sky above her, free--utterly free from fleck or
cloud. Her husband had to attend drill, and she, the most musical
officer's wife there, had to copy the new and popular tunes out of the
most recent English music, for the benefit of the bandmaster; those
seemed their most severe and arduous duties. She expressed an
affectionate hope that, if the regiment stopped another year at Corfu,
Margaret might come out and pay her a long visit. She asked Margaret if
she remembered the day twelve-month on which she, Edith, wrote--how it
rained all day long in Harley Street; and how she would not put on her
new gown to go to a stupid dinner, and get it all wet and splashed in
going to the carriage; and how at that very dinner they had first met
Captain Lennox.

Yes! Margaret remembered it well. Edith and Mrs. Shaw had gone to
dinner. Margaret had joined the party in the evening. The recollection
of the plentiful luxury of all the arrangements, the stately
handsomeness of the furniture, the size of the house, the peaceful,
untroubled ease of the visitors--all came vividly before her, in strange
contrast to the present time. The smooth sea of that old life closed up,
without a mark left to tell where they had all been. The habitual
dinners, the calls, the shopping, the dancing evenings, were all going
on, going on for ever, though her Aunt Shaw and Edith were no longer
there; and she, of course, was even less missed. She doubted if any one
of that old set ever thought of her, except Henry Lennox. He too, she
knew, would strive to forget her, because of the pain she had caused
him. She had heard him often boast of his power of putting any
disagreeable thought far away from him. Then she penetrated farther into
what might have been. If she had cared for him as a lover, and had
accepted him, and this change in her father's opinions and consequent
station had taken place, she could not doubt but that it would have been
impatiently received by Mr. Lennox. It was a bitter mortification to her
in one sense; but she could bear it patiently, because she knew her
father's purity of purpose, and that strengthened her to endure his
errors, grave and serious though in her estimation they were. But the
fact of the world esteeming her father degraded, in its rough wholesale
judgment, would have oppressed and irritated Mr. Lennox. As she realised
what might have been, she grew to be thankful for what was. They were at
the lowest now; they could not be worse. Edith's astonishment and her
aunt Shaw's dismay would have to be met bravely, when their letters
came. So Margaret rose up and began slowly to undress herself, feeling
the full luxury of acting leisurely, late as it was, after all the past
hurry of the day. She fell asleep, hoping for some brightness, either
internal or external. But if she had known how long it would be before
the brightness came, her heart would have sunk low down. The time of the
year was most unpropitious to health as well as to spirits. Her mother
caught a severe cold, and Dixon herself was evidently not well, although
Margaret could not insult her more than by trying to save her, or by
taking any care of her. They could hear of no girl to assist her; all
were at work in the factories; at least, those who applied were well
scolded by Dixon, for thinking that such as they could ever be trusted
to work in a gentleman's house. So they had to keep a charwoman in
almost constant employ. Margaret longed to send for Charlotte; but
besides the objection of her being a better servant than they could now
afford to keep, the distance was too great.

Mr. Hale met with several pupils, recommended to him by Mr. Bell, or by
the more immediate influence of Mr. Thornton. They were mostly of the
age when many boys would be still at school, but, according to the
prevalent, and apparently well-founded notions of Milton, to make a lad
into a good tradesman he must be caught young, and acclimated to the
life of the mill, or office, or warehouse. If he were sent to even the
Scotch Universities, he came back unsettled for commercial pursuits; how
much more so if he went to Oxford or Cambridge, where he could not be
entered till he was eighteen? So most of the manufacturers placed their
sons in sucking situations' at fourteen or fifteen years of age,
unsparingly cutting away all off-shoots in the direction of literature
or high mental cultivation, in hopes of throwing the whole strength and
vigour of the plant into commerce. Still there were some wiser parents;
and some young men, who had sense enough to perceive their own
deficiencies, and strive to remedy them. Nay, there were a few no longer
youths, but men in the prime of life, who had the stern wisdom to
acknowledge their own ignorance, and to learn late what they should have
learnt early. Mr. Thornton was perhaps the oldest of Mr. Hale's pupils.
He was certainly the favourite. Mr. Hale got into the habit of quoting
his opinions so frequently, and with such regard, that it became a
little domestic joke to wonder what time, during the hour appointed for
instruction, could be given to absolute learning, so much of it appeared
to have been spent in conversation.

Margaret rather encouraged this light, merry way of viewing her father's
acquaintance with Mr. Thornton, because she felt that her mother was
inclined to look upon this new friendship of her husband's with jealous
eyes. As long as his time had been solely occupied with his books and
his parishioners, as at Helstone, she had appeared to care little
whether she saw much of him or not; but now that he looked eagerly
forward to each renewal of his intercourse with Mr. Thornton, she seemed
hurt and annoyed, as if he were slighting her companionship for the
first time. Mr. Hale's over-praise had the usual effect of over-praise
upon his auditors; they were a little inclined to rebel against
Aristides being always called the Just.

After a quiet life in a country parsonage for more than twenty years,
there was something dazzling to Mr. Hale in the energy which conquered
immense difficulties with ease; the power of the machinery of Milton,
the power of the men of Milton, impressed him with a sense of grandeur,
which he yielded to without caring to inquire into the details of its
exercise. But Margaret went less abroad, among machinery and men; saw
less of power in its public effect, and, as it happened, she was thrown
with one or two of those who, in all measures affecting masses of
people, must be acute sufferers for the good of many. The question
always is, has everything been done to make the sufferings of these
exceptions as small as possible? Or, in the triumph of the crowded
procession, have the helpless been trampled on, instead of being gently
lifted aside out of the roadway of the conqueror, whom they have no
power to accompany on his march?

It fell to Margaret's share to have to look out for a servant to assist
Dixon, who had at first undertaken to find just the person she wanted to
do all the rough work of the house. But Dixon's ideas of helpful girls
were founded on the recollection of tidy elder scholars at Helstone
school, who were only too proud to be allowed to come to the parsonage
on a busy day, and treated Mrs. Dixon with all the respect, and a good
deal more of fright, which they paid to Mr. and Mrs. Hale. Dixon was not
unconscious of this awed reverence which was given to her; nor did she
dislike it; it flattered her much as Louis the Fourteenth was flattered
by his courtiers shading their eyes from the dazzling light of his
presence. But nothing short of her faithful love for Mrs. Hale could
have made her endure the rough independent way in which all the Milton
girls, who made application for the servant's place, replied to her
inquiries respecting their qualifications. They even went the length of
questioning her back again; having doubts and fears of their own, as to
the solvency of a family who lived in a house of thirty pounds a-year,
and yet gave themselves airs, and kept two servants, one of them so very
high and mighty. Mr. Hale was no longer looked upon as Vicar of
Helstone, but as a man who only spent at a certain rate. Margaret was
weary and impatient of the accounts which Dixon perpetually brought to
Mrs. Hale of the behaviour of these would-be servants. Not but what
Margaret was repelled by the rough uncourteous manners of these people;
not but what she shrunk with fastidious pride from their hail-fellow
accost and severely resented their unconcealed curiosity as to the means
and position of any family who lived in Milton, and yet were not engaged
in trade of some kind. But the more Margaret felt impertinence, the more
likely she was to be silent on the subject; and, at any rate, if she
took upon herself to make inquiry for a servant, she could spare her
mother the recital of all her disappointments and fancied or real
insults.

Margaret accordingly went up and down to butchers and grocers, seeking
for a nonpareil of a girl; and lowering her hopes and expectations every
week, as she found the difficulty of meeting with any one in a
manufacturing town who did not prefer the better wages and greater
independence of working in a mill. It was something of a trial to
Margaret to go out by herself in this busy bustling place. Mrs. Shaw's
ideas of propriety and her own helpless dependence on others, had always
made her insist that a footman should accompany Edith and Margaret, if
they went beyond Harley Street or the immediate neighbourhood. The
limits by which this rule of her aunt's had circumscribed Margaret's
independence had been silently rebelled against at the time: and she had
doubly enjoyed the free walks and rambles of her forest life, from the
contrast which they presented. She went along there with a bounding
fearless step, that occasionally broke out into a run, if she were in a
hurry, and occasionally was stilled into perfect repose, as she stood
listening to, or watching any of the wild creatures who sang in the
leafy courts, or glanced out with their keen bright eyes from the low
brushwood or tangled furze. It was a trial to come down from such motion
or such stillness, only guided by her own sweet will, to the even and
decorous pace necessary in streets. But she could have laughed at
herself for minding this change, if it had not been accompanied by what
was a more serious annoyance. The side of the town on which Crampton lay
was especially a thoroughfare for the factory people. In the back
streets around them there were many mills, out of which poured streams
of men and women two or three times a day. Until Margaret had learnt the
times of their ingress and egress, she was very unfortunate in
constantly falling in with them. They came rushing along, with bold,
fearless faces, and loud laughs and jests, particularly aimed at all
those who appeared to be above them in rank or station. The tones of
their unrestrained voices, and their carelessness of all common rules of
street politeness, frightened Margaret a little at first. The girls,
with their rough, but not unfriendly freedom, would comment on her
dress, even touch her shawl or gown to ascertain the exact material;
nay, once or twice she was asked questions relative to some article
which they particularly admired. There was such a simple reliance on her
womanly sympathy with their love of dress, and on her kindliness, that
she gladly replied to these inquiries, as soon as she understood them;
and half smiled back at their remarks. She did not mind meeting any
number of girls, loud spoken and boisterous though they might be. But
she alternately dreaded and fired up against the workmen, who commented
not on her dress, but on her looks, in the same open fearless manner.
She, who had hitherto felt that even the most refined remark on her
personal appearance was an impertinence, had to endure undisguised
admiration from these outspoken men. But the very out-spokenness marked
their innocence of any intention to hurt her delicacy, as she would have
perceived if she had been less frightened by the disorderly tumult. Out
of her fright came a flash of indignation which made her face scarlet,
and her dark eyes gather flame, as she heard some of their speeches. Yet
there were other sayings of theirs, which, when she reached the quiet
safety of home, amused her even while they irritated her.

For instance, one day, after she had passed a number of men, several of
whom had paid her the not unusual compliment of wishing she was their
sweetheart, one of the lingerers added, 'Your bonny face, my lass, makes
the day look brighter.' And another day, as she was unconsciously
smiling at some passing thought, she was addressed by a poorly-dressed,
middle-aged workman, with 'You may well smile, my lass; many a one would
smile to have such a bonny face.' This man looked so careworn that
Margaret could not help giving him an answering smile, glad to think
that her looks, such as they were, should have had the power to call up
a pleasant thought. He seemed to understand her acknowledging glance,
and a silent recognition was established between them whenever the
chances of the day brought them across each other's paths. They had
never exchanged a word; nothing had been said but that first compliment;
yet somehow Margaret looked upon this man with more interest than upon
any one else in Milton. Once or twice, on Sundays, she saw him walking
with a girl, evidently his daughter, and, if possible, still more
unhealthy than he was himself.

One day Margaret and her father had been as far as the fields that lay
around the town; it was early spring, and she had gathered some of the
hedge and ditch flowers, dog-violets, lesser celandines, and the like,
with an unspoken lament in her heart for the sweet profusion of the
South. Her father had left her to go into Milton upon some business; and
on the road home she met her humble friends. The girl looked wistfully
at the flowers, and, acting on a sudden impulse, Margaret offered them
to her. Her pale blue eyes lightened up as she took them, and her father
spoke for her.

'Thank yo, Miss. Bessy'll think a deal o' them flowers; that hoo will;
and I shall think a deal o' yor kindness. Yo're not of this country, I
reckon?'

'No!' said Margaret, half sighing. 'I come from the South--from
Hampshire,' she continued, a little afraid of wounding his consciousness
of ignorance, if she used a name which he did not understand.

'That's beyond London, I reckon? And I come fro' Burnley-ways, and forty
mile to th' North. And yet, yo see, North and South has both met and
made kind o' friends in this big smoky place.'

Margaret had slackened her pace to walk alongside of the man and his
daughter, whose steps were regulated by the feebleness of the latter.
She now spoke to the girl, and there was a sound of tender pity in the
tone of her voice as she did so that went right to the heart of the
father.

'I'm afraid you are not very strong.'

'No,' said the girl, 'nor never will be.'

'Spring is coming,' said Margaret, as if to suggest pleasant, hopeful
thoughts.

'Spring nor summer will do me good,' said the girl quietly.

Margaret looked up at the man, almost expecting some contradiction from
him, or at least some remark that would modify his daughter's utter
hopelessness. But, instead, he added--

'I'm afeared hoo speaks truth. I'm afeared hoo's too far gone in a
waste.'

'I shall have a spring where I'm boun to, and flowers, and amaranths,
and shining robes besides.'

'Poor lass, poor lass!' said her father in a low tone. 'I'm none so sure
o' that; but it's a comfort to thee, poor lass, poor lass. Poor father!
it'll be soon.'

Margaret was shocked by his words--shocked but not repelled; rather
attracted and interested.

'Where do you live? I think we must be neighbours, we meet so often on
this road.'

'We put up at nine Frances Street, second turn to th' left at after
yo've past th' Goulden Dragon.'

'And your name? I must not forget that.'

'I'm none ashamed o' my name. It's Nicholas Higgins. Hoo's called Bessy
Higgins. Whatten yo' asking for?'

Margaret was surprised at this last question, for at Helstone it would
have been an understood thing, after the inquiries she had made, that
she intended to come and call upon any poor neighbour whose name and
habitation she had asked for.

'I thought--I meant to come and see you.' She suddenly felt rather shy
of offering the visit, without having any reason to give for her wish to
make it, beyond a kindly interest in a stranger. It seemed all at once
to take the shape of an impertinence on her part; she read this meaning
too in the man's eyes.

'I'm none so fond of having strange folk in my house.' But then
relenting, as he saw her heightened colour, he added, 'Yo're a
foreigner, as one may say, and maybe don't know many folk here, and
yo've given my wench here flowers out of yo'r own hand;--yo may come if
yo like.'

Margaret was half-amused, half-nettled at this answer. She was not sure
if she would go where permission was given so like a favour conferred.
But when they came to the town into Frances Street, the girl stopped a
minute, and said,

'Yo'll not forget yo're to come and see us.'

'Aye, aye,' said the father, impatiently, 'hoo'll come. Hoo's a bit set
up now, because hoo thinks I might ha' spoken more civilly; but hoo'll
think better on it, and come. I can read her proud bonny face like a
book. Come along, Bess; there's the mill bell ringing.'

Margaret went home, wondering at her new friends, and smiling at the
man's insight into what had been passing in her mind. From that day
Milton became a brighter place to her. It was not the long, bleak sunny
days of spring, nor yet was it that time was reconciling her to the town
of her habitation. It was that in it she had found a human interest.




CHAPTER IX

DRESSING FOR TEA

    'Let China's earth, enrich'd with colour'd stains,
     Pencil'd with gold, and streak'd with azure veins,
     The grateful flavour of the Indian leaf,
     Or Mocho's sunburnt berry glad receive.'
             MRS. BARBAULD.


The day after this meeting with Higgins and his daughter, Mr. Hale came
upstairs into the little drawing-room at an unusual hour. He went up to
different objects in the room, as if examining them, but Margaret saw
that it was merely a nervous trick--a way of putting off something he
wished, yet feared to say. Out it came at last--

'My dear! I've asked Mr. Thornton to come to tea to-night.'

Mrs. Hale was leaning back in her easy chair, with her eyes shut, and an
expression of pain on her face which had become habitual to her of late.
But she roused up into querulousness at this speech of her husband's.

'Mr. Thornton!--and to-night! What in the world does the man want to
come here for? And Dixon is washing my muslins and laces, and there is
no soft water with these horrid east winds, which I suppose we shall
have all the year round in Milton.'

'The wind is veering round, my dear,' said Mr. Hale, looking out at the
smoke, which drifted right from the east, only he did not yet understand
the points of the compass, and rather arranged them ad libitum,
according to circumstances.

'Don't tell me!' said Mrs. Hale, shuddering up, and wrapping her shawl
about her still more closely. 'But, east or west wind, I suppose this
man comes.'

'Oh, mamma, that shows you never saw Mr. Thornton. He looks like a
person who would enjoy battling with every adverse thing he could meet
with--enemies, winds, or circumstances. The more it rains and blows, the
more certain we are to have him. But I'll go and help Dixon. I'm getting
to be a famous clear-starcher. And he won't want any amusement beyond
talking to papa. Papa, I am really longing to see the Pythias to your
Damon. You know I never saw him but once, and then we were so puzzled to
know what to say to each other that we did not get on particularly
well.'

'I don't know that you would ever like him, or think him agreeable,
Margaret. He is not a lady's man.'

Margaret wreathed her throat in a scornful curve.

'I don't particularly admire ladies' men, papa. But Mr. Thornton comes
here as your friend--as one who has appreciated you'--

'The only person in Milton,' said Mrs. Hale.

'So we will give him a welcome, and some cocoa-nut cakes. Dixon will be
flattered if we ask her to make some; and I will undertake to iron your
caps, mamma.'

Many a time that morning did Margaret wish Mr. Thornton far enough away.
She had planned other employments for herself: a letter to Edith, a good
piece of Dante, a visit to the Higginses. But, instead, she ironed away,
listening to Dixon's complaints, and only hoping that by an excess of
sympathy she might prevent her from carrying the recital of her sorrows
to Mrs. Hale. Every now and then, Margaret had to remind herself of her
father's regard for Mr. Thornton, to subdue the irritation of weariness
that was stealing over her, and bringing on one of the bad headaches to
which she had lately become liable. She could hardly speak when she sat
down at last, and told her mother that she was no longer Peggy the
laundry-maid, but Margaret Hale the lady. She meant this speech for a
little joke, and was vexed enough with her busy tongue when she found
her mother taking it seriously.

'Yes! if any one had told me, when I was Miss Beresford, and one of the
belles of the county, that a child of mine would have to stand half a
day, in a little poky kitchen, working away like any servant, that we
might prepare properly for the reception of a tradesman, and that this
tradesman should be the only'--'Oh, mamma!' said Margaret, lifting
herself up, 'don't punish me so for a careless speech. I don't mind
ironing, or any kind of work, for you and papa. I am myself a born and
bred lady through it all, even though it comes to scouring a floor, or
washing dishes. I am tired now, just for a little while; but in half an
hour I shall be ready to do the same over again. And as to Mr.
Thornton's being in trade, why he can't help that now, poor fellow. I
don't suppose his education would fit him for much else.' Margaret
lifted herself slowly up, and went to her own room; for just now she
could not bear much more.

In Mr. Thornton's house, at this very same time, a similar, yet
different, scene was going on. A large-boned lady, long past middle age,
sat at work in a grim handsomely-furnished dining-room. Her features,
like her frame, were strong and massive, rather than heavy. Her face
moved slowly from one decided expression to another equally decided.
There was no great variety in her countenance; but those who looked at
it once, generally looked at it again; even the passers-by in the
street, half-turned their heads to gaze an instant longer at the firm,
severe, dignified woman, who never gave way in street-courtesy, or
paused in her straight-onward course to the clearly-defined end which
she proposed to herself. She was handsomely dressed in stout black silk,
of which not a thread was worn or discoloured. She was mending a large
long table-cloth of the finest texture, holding it up against the light
occasionally to discover thin places, which required her delicate care.
There was not a book about in the room, with the exception of Matthew
Henry's Bible Commentaries, six volumes of which lay in the centre of
the massive side-board, flanked by a tea-urn on one side, and a lamp on
the other. In some remote apartment, there was exercise upon the piano
going on. Some one was practising up a morceau de salon, playing it very
rapidly; every third note, on an average, being either indistinct, or
wholly missed out, and the loud chords at the end being half of them
false, but not the less satisfactory to the performer. Mrs. Thornton
heard a step, like her own in its decisive character, pass the
dining-room door.

'John! Is that you?'

Her son opened the door and showed himself.

'What has brought you home so early? I thought you were going to tea
with that friend of Mr. Bell's; that Mr. Hale.'

'So I am, mother; I am come home to dress!'

'Dress! humph! When I was a girl, young men were satisfied with dressing
once in a day. Why should you dress to go and take a cup of tea with an
old parson?'

'Mr. Hale is a gentleman, and his wife and daughter are ladies.'

'Wife and daughter! Do they teach too? What do they do? You have never
mentioned them.'

'No! mother, because I have never seen Mrs. Hale; I have only seen Miss
Hale for half an hour.'

'Take care you don't get caught by a penniless girl, John.'

'I am not easily caught, mother, as I think you know. But I must not
have Miss Hale spoken of in that way, which, you know, is offensive to
me. I never was aware of any young lady trying to catch me yet, nor do I
believe that any one has ever given themselves that useless trouble.'

Mrs. Thornton did not choose to yield the point to her son; or else she
had, in general, pride enough for her sex.

'Well! I only say, take care. Perhaps our Milton girls have too much
spirit and good feeling to go angling after husbands; but this Miss Hale
comes out of the aristocratic counties, where, if all tales be true,
rich husbands are reckoned prizes.'

Mr. Thornton's brow contracted, and he came a step forward into the
room.

'Mother' (with a short scornful laugh), 'you will make me confess. The
only time I saw Miss Hale, she treated me with a haughty civility which
had a strong flavour of contempt in it. She held herself aloof from me
as if she had been a queen, and I her humble, unwashed vassal. Be easy,
mother.'

'No! I am not easy, nor content either. What business had she, a
renegade clergyman's daughter, to turn up her nose at you! I would dress
for none of them--a saucy set! if I were you.' As he was leaving the
room, he said:--

'Mr. Hale is good, and gentle, and learned. He is not saucy. As for Mrs.
Hale, I will tell you what she is like to-night, if you care to hear.'
He shut the door and was gone.

'Despise my son! treat him as her vassal, indeed! Humph! I should like
to know where she could find such another! Boy and man, he's the
noblest, stoutest heart I ever knew. I don't care if I am his mother; I
can see what's what, and not be blind. I know what Fanny is; and I know
what John is. Despise him! I hate her!'




CHAPTER X

WROUGHT IRON AND GOLD

    'We are the trees whom shaking fastens more.'
             GEORGE HERBERT.


Mr. Thornton left the house without coming into the dining-room again.
He was rather late, and walked rapidly out to Crampton. He was anxious
not to slight his new friend by any disrespectful unpunctuality. The
church-clock struck half-past seven as he stood at the door awaiting
Dixon's slow movements; always doubly tardy when she had to degrade
herself by answering the door-bell. He was ushered into the little
drawing-room, and kindly greeted by Mr. Hale, who led him up to his
wife, whose pale face, and shawl-draped figure made a silent excuse for
the cold languor of her greeting. Margaret was lighting the lamp when he
entered, for the darkness was coming on. The lamp threw a pretty light
into the centre of the dusky room, from which, with country habits, they
did not exclude the night-skies, and the outer darkness of air. Somehow,
that room contrasted itself with the one he had lately left; handsome,
ponderous, with no sign of feminine habitation, except in the one spot
where his mother sate, and no convenience for any other employment than
eating and drinking. To be sure, it was a dining-room; his mother
preferred to sit in it; and her will was a household law. But the
drawing-room was not like this. It was twice--twenty times as fine; not
one quarter as comfortable. Here were no mirrors, not even a scrap of
glass to reflect the light, and answer the same purpose as water in a
landscape; no gilding; a warm, sober breadth of colouring, well relieved
by the dear old Helstone chintz-curtains and chair covers. An open
davenport stood in the window opposite the door; in the other there was
a stand, with a tall white china vase, from which drooped wreaths of
English ivy, pale-green birch, and copper-coloured beech-leaves. Pretty
baskets of work stood about in different places: and books, not cared
for on account of their binding solely, lay on one table, as if recently
put down. Behind the door was another table, decked out for tea, with a
white tablecloth, on which flourished the cocoa-nut cakes, and a basket
piled with oranges and ruddy American apples, heaped on leaves.

It appeared to Mr. Thornton that all these graceful cares were habitual
to the family; and especially of a piece with Margaret. She stood by the
tea-table in a light-coloured muslin gown, which had a good deal of pink
about it. She looked as if she was not attending to the conversation,
but solely busy with the tea-cups, among which her round ivory hands
moved with pretty, noiseless, daintiness. She had a bracelet on one
taper arm, which would fall down over her round wrist. Mr. Thornton
watched the replacing of this troublesome ornament with far more
attention than he listened to her father. It seemed as if it fascinated
him to see her push it up impatiently, until it tightened her soft
flesh; and then to mark the loosening--the fall. He could almost have
exclaimed--'There it goes, again!' There was so little left to be done
after he arrived at the preparation for tea, that he was almost sorry
the obligation of eating and drinking came so soon to prevent his
watching Margaret. She handed him his cup of tea with the proud air of
an unwilling slave; but her eye caught the moment when he was ready for
another cup; and he almost longed to ask her to do for him what he saw
her compelled to do for her father, who took her little finger and thumb
in his masculine hand, and made them serve as sugar-tongs. Mr. Thornton
saw her beautiful eyes lifted to her father, full of light,
half-laughter and half-love, as this bit of pantomime went on between
the two, unobserved, as they fancied, by any. Margaret's head still
ached, as the paleness of her complexion, and her silence might have
testified; but she was resolved to throw herself into the breach, if
there was any long untoward pause, rather than that her father's friend,
pupil, and guest should have cause to think himself in any way
neglected. But the conversation went on; and Margaret drew into a
corner, near her mother, with her work, after the tea-things were taken
away; and felt that she might let her thoughts roam, without fear of
being suddenly wanted to fill up a gap.

Mr. Thornton and Mr. Hale were both absorbed in the continuation of some
subject which had been started at their last meeting. Margaret was
recalled to a sense of the present by some trivial, low-spoken remark of
her mother's; and on suddenly looking up from her work, her eye was
caught by the difference of outward appearance between her father and
Mr. Thornton, as betokening such distinctly opposite natures. Her father
was of slight figure, which made him appear taller than he really was,
when not contrasted, as at this time, with the tall, massive frame of
another. The lines in her father's face were soft and waving, with a
frequent undulating kind of trembling movement passing over them,
showing every fluctuating emotion; the eyelids were large and arched,
giving to the eyes a peculiar languid beauty which was almost feminine.
The brows were finely arched, but were, by the very size of the dreamy
lids, raised to a considerable distance from the eyes. Now, in Mr.
Thornton's face the straight brows fell low over the clear, deep-set
earnest eyes, which, without being unpleasantly sharp, seemed intent
enough to penetrate into the very heart and core of what he was looking
at. The lines in the face were few but firm, as if they were carved in
marble, and lay principally about the lips, which were slightly
compressed over a set of teeth so faultless and beautiful as to give the
effect of sudden sunlight when the rare bright smile, coming in an
instant and shining out of the eyes, changed the whole look from the
severe and resolved expression of a man ready to do and dare everything,
to the keen honest enjoyment of the moment, which is seldom shown so
fearlessly and instantaneously except by children. Margaret liked this
smile; it was the first thing she had admired in this new friend of her
father's; and the opposition of character, shown in all these details of
appearance she had just been noticing, seemed to explain the attraction
they evidently felt towards each other.

She rearranged her mother's worsted-work, and fell back into her own
thoughts--as completely forgotten by Mr. Thornton as if she had not been
in the room, so thoroughly was he occupied in explaining to Mr. Hale the
magnificent power, yet delicate adjustment of the might of the
steam-hammer, which was recalling to Mr. Hale some of the wonderful
stories of subservient genii in the Arabian Nights--one moment
stretching from earth to sky and filling all the width of the horizon,
at the next obediently compressed into a vase small enough to be borne
in the hand of a child.

'And this imagination of power, this practical realisation of a gigantic
thought, came out of one man's brain in our good town. That very man has
it within him to mount, step by step, on each wonder he achieves to
higher marvels still. And I'll be bound to say, we have many among us
who, if he were gone, could spring into the breach and carry on the war
which compels, and shall compel, all material power to yield to
science.'

'Your boast reminds me of the old lines--

    "I've a hundred
    captains in England," he said,
     "As good as ever was he."'

At her father's quotation Margaret looked suddenly up, with inquiring
wonder in her eyes. How in the world had they got from cog-wheels to
Chevy Chace?

'It is no boast of mine,' replied Mr. Thornton; 'it is plain
matter-of-fact. I won't deny that I am proud of belonging to a town--or
perhaps I should rather say a district--the necessities of which give
birth to such grandeur of conception. I would rather be a man toiling,
suffering--nay, failing and successless--here, than lead a dull
prosperous life in the old worn grooves of what you call more
aristocratic society down in the South, with their slow days of careless
ease. One may be clogged with honey and unable to rise and fly.'

'You are mistaken,' said Margaret, roused by the aspersion on her
beloved South to a fond vehemence of defence, that brought the colour
into her cheeks and the angry tears into her eyes. 'You do not know
anything about the South. If there is less adventure or less progress--I
suppose I must not say less excitement--from the gambling spirit of
trade, which seems requisite to force out these wonderful inventions,
there is less suffering also. I see men here going about in the streets
who look ground down by some pinching sorrow or care--who are not only
sufferers but haters. Now, in the South we have our poor, but there is
not that terrible expression in their countenances of a sullen sense of
injustice which I see here. You do not know the South, Mr. Thornton,'
she concluded, collapsing into a determined silence, and angry with
herself for having said so much.

'And may I say you do not know the North?' asked he, with an
inexpressible gentleness in his tone, as he saw that he had really hurt
her. She continued resolutely silent; yearning after the lovely haunts
she had left far away in Hampshire, with a passionate longing that made
her feel her voice would be unsteady and trembling if she spoke.

'At any rate, Mr. Thornton,' said Mrs. Hale, 'you will allow that Milton
is a much more smoky, dirty town than you will ever meet with in the
South.'

'I'm afraid I must give up its cleanliness,' said Mr. Thornton, with the
quick gleaming smile. 'But we are bidden by parliament to burn our own
smoke; so I suppose, like good little children, we shall do as we are
bid--some time.'

'But I think you told me you had altered your chimneys so as to consume
the smoke, did you not?' asked Mr. Hale.

'Mine were altered by my own will, before parliament meddled with the
affair. It was an immediate outlay, but it repays me in the saving of
coal. I'm not sure whether I should have done it, if I had waited until
the act was passed. At any rate, I should have waited to be informed
against and fined, and given all the trouble in yielding that I legally
could. But all laws which depend for their enforcement upon informers
and fines, become inert from the odiousness of the machinery. I doubt if
there has been a chimney in Milton informed against for five years past,
although some are constantly sending out one-third of their coal in what
is called here unparliamentary smoke.'

'I only know it is impossible to keep the muslin blinds clean here above
a week together; and at Helstone we have had them up for a month or
more, and they have not looked dirty at the end of that time. And as for
hands--Margaret, how many times did you say you had washed your hands
this morning before twelve o'clock? Three times, was it not?'

'Yes, mamma.'

'You seem to have a strong objection to acts of parliament and all
legislation affecting your mode of management down here at Milton,' said
Mr. Hale.

'Yes, I have; and many others have as well. And with justice, I think.
The whole machinery--I don't mean the wood and iron machinery now--of
the cotton trade is so new that it is no wonder if it does not work well
in every part all at once. Seventy years ago what was it? And now what
is it not? Raw, crude materials came together; men of the same level, as
regarded education and station, took suddenly the different positions of
masters and men, owing to the motherwit, as regarded opportunities and
probabilities, which distinguished some, and made them far-seeing as to
what great future lay concealed in that rude model of Sir Richard
Arkwright's. The rapid development of what might be called a new trade,
gave those early masters enormous power of wealth and command. I don't
mean merely over the workmen; I mean over purchasers--over the whole
world's market. Why, I may give you, as an instance, an advertisement,
inserted not fifty years ago in a Milton paper, that so-and-so (one of
the half-dozen calico-printers of the time) would close his warehouse at
noon each day; therefore, that all purchasers must come before that
hour. Fancy a man dictating in this manner the time when he would sell
and when he would not sell. Now, I believe, if a good customer chose to
come at midnight, I should get up, and stand hat in hand to receive his
orders.'

Margaret's lip curled, but somehow she was compelled to listen; she
could no longer abstract herself in her own thoughts.

'I only name such things to show what almost unlimited power the
manufacturers had about the beginning of this century. The men were
rendered dizzy by it. Because a man was successful in his ventures,
there was no reason that in all other things his mind should be
well-balanced. On the contrary, his sense of justice, and his
simplicity, were often utterly smothered under the glut of wealth that
came down upon him; and they tell strange tales of the wild extravagance
of living indulged in on gala-days by those early cotton-lords. There
can be no doubt, too, of the tyranny they exercised over their
work-people. You know the proverb, Mr. Hale, "Set a beggar on horseback,
and he'll ride to the devil,"--well, some of these early manufacturers
did ride to the devil in a magnificent style--crushing human bone and
flesh under their horses' hoofs without remorse. But by-and-by came a
re-action, there were more factories, more masters; more men were
wanted. The power of masters and men became more evenly balanced; and
now the battle is pretty fairly waged between us. We will hardly submit
to the decision of an umpire, much less to the interference of a meddler
with only a smattering of the knowledge of the real facts of the case,
even though that meddler be called the High Court of Parliament.

'Is there necessity for calling it a battle between the two classes?'
asked Mr. Hale. 'I know, from your using the term, it is one which gives
a true idea of the real state of things to your mind.'

'It is true; and I believe it to be as much a necessity as that prudent
wisdom and good conduct are always opposed to, and doing battle with
ignorance and improvidence. It is one of the great beauties of our
system, that a working-man may raise himself into the power and position
of a master by his own exertions and behaviour; that, in fact, every one
who rules himself to decency and sobriety of conduct, and attention to
his duties, comes over to our ranks; it may not be always as a master,
but as an over-looker, a cashier, a book-keeper, a clerk, one on the
side of authority and order.'

'You consider all who are unsuccessful in raising themselves in the
world, from whatever cause, as your enemies, then, if I under-stand you
rightly,' said Margaret in a clear, cold voice.

'As their own enemies, certainly,' said he, quickly, not a little piqued
by the haughty disapproval her form of expression and tone of speaking
implied. But, in a moment, his straightforward honesty made him feel
that his words were but a poor and quibbling answer to what she had
said; and, be she as scornful as she liked, it was a duty he owed to
himself to explain, as truly as he could, what he did mean. Yet it was
very difficult to separate her interpretation, and keep it distinct from
his meaning. He could best have illustrated what he wanted to say by
telling them something of his own life; but was it not too personal a
subject to speak about to strangers? Still, it was the simple
straightforward way of explaining his meaning; so, putting aside the
touch of shyness that brought a momentary flush of colour into his dark
cheek, he said:

'I am not speaking without book. Sixteen years ago, my father died under
very miserable circumstances. I was taken from school, and had to become
a man (as well as I could) in a few days. I had such a mother as few are
blest with; a woman of strong power, and firm resolve. We went into a
small country town, where living was cheaper than in Milton, and where I
got employment in a draper's shop (a capital place, by the way, for
obtaining a knowledge of goods). Week by week our income came to fifteen
shillings, out of which three people had to be kept. My mother managed
so that I put by three out of these fifteen shillings regularly. This
made the beginning; this taught me self-denial. Now that I am able to
afford my mother such comforts as her age, rather than her own wish,
requires, I thank her silently on each occasion for the early training
she gave me. Now when I feel that in my own case it is no good luck, nor
merit, nor talent,--but simply the habits of life which taught me to
despise indulgences not thoroughly earned,--indeed, never to think twice
about them,--I believe that this suffering, which Miss Hale says is
impressed on the countenances of the people of Milton, is but the
natural punishment of dishonestly-enjoyed pleasure, at some former
period of their lives. I do not look on self-indulgent, sensual people
as worthy of my hatred; I simply look upon them with contempt for their
poorness of character.'

'But you have had the rudiments of a good education,' remarked Mr. Hale.
'The quick zest with which you are now reading Homer, shows me that you
do not come to it as an unknown book; you have read it before, and are
only recalling your old knowledge.'

'That is true,--I had blundered along it at school; I dare say, I was
even considered a pretty fair classic in those days, though my Latin and
Greek have slipt away from me since. But I ask you, what preparation
they were for such a life as I had to lead? None at all. Utterly none at
all. On the point of education, any man who can read and write starts
fair with me in the amount of really useful knowledge that I had at that
time.'

'Well! I don't agree with you. But there I am perhaps somewhat of a
pedant. Did not the recollection of the heroic simplicity of the Homeric
life nerve you up?'

'Not one bit!' exclaimed Mr. Thornton, laughing. 'I was too busy to
think about any dead people, with the living pressing alongside of me,
neck to neck, in the struggle for bread. Now that I have my mother safe
in the quiet peace that becomes her age, and duly rewards her former
exertions, I can turn to all that old narration and thoroughly enjoy
it.'

'I dare say, my remark came from the professional feeling of there being
nothing like leather,' replied Mr. Hale.

When Mr. Thornton rose up to go away, after shaking hands with Mr. and
Mrs. Hale, he made an advance to Margaret to wish her good-bye in a
similar manner. It was the frank familiar custom of the place; but
Margaret was not prepared for it. She simply bowed her farewell;
although the instant she saw the hand, half put out, quickly drawn back,
she was sorry she had not been aware of the intention. Mr. Thornton,
however, knew nothing of her sorrow, and, drawing himself up to his full
height, walked off, muttering as he left the house--

'A more proud, disagreeable girl I never saw. Even her great beauty is
blotted out of one's memory by her scornful ways.'




CHAPTER XI

FIRST IMPRESSIONS

    'There's iron, they say, in all our blood,
     And a grain or two perhaps is good;
     But his, he makes me harshly feel,
     Has got a little too much of steel.'
             ANON.


'Margaret!' said Mr. Hale, as he returned from showing his guest
downstairs; 'I could not help watching your face with some anxiety, when
Mr. Thornton made his confession of having been a shop-boy. I knew it
all along from Mr. Bell; so I was aware of what was coming; but I half
expected to see you get up and leave the room.'

'Oh, papa! you don't mean that you thought me so silly? I really liked
that account of himself better than anything else he said. Everything
else revolted me, from its hardness; but he spoke about himself so
simply--with so little of the pretence that makes the vulgarity of
shop-people, and with such tender respect for his mother, that I was
less likely to leave the room then than when he was boasting about
Milton, as if there was not such another place in the world; or quietly
professing to despise people for careless, wasteful improvidence,
without ever seeming to think it his duty to try to make them
different,--to give them anything of the training which his mother gave
him, and to which he evidently owes his position, whatever that may be.
No! his statement of having been a shop-boy was the thing I liked best
of all.'

'I am surprised at you, Margaret,' said her mother. 'You who were always
accusing people of being shoppy at Helstone! I don't think, Mr. Hale,
you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without
telling us what he had been. I really was very much afraid of showing
him how much shocked I was at some parts of what he said. His father
"dying in miserable circumstances." Why it might have been in the
workhouse.'

'I am not sure if it was not worse than being in the workhouse,' replied
her husband. 'I heard a good deal of his previous life from Mr. Bell
before we came here; and as he has told you a part, I will fill up what
he left out. His father speculated wildly, failed, and then killed
himself, because he could not bear the disgrace. All his former friends
shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest
gambling--wild, hopeless struggles, made with other people's money, to
regain his own moderate portion of wealth. No one came forwards to help
the mother and this boy. There was another child, I believe, a girl; too
young to earn money, but of course she had to be kept. At least, no
friend came forwards immediately, and Mrs. Thornton is not one, I fancy,
to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out. So they left Milton.
I knew he had gone into a shop, and that his earnings, with some
fragment of property secured to his mother, had been made to keep them
for a long time. Mr. Bell said they absolutely lived upon water-porridge
for years--how, he did not know; but long after the creditors had given
up hope of any payment of old Mr. Thornton's debts (if, indeed, they
ever had hoped at all about it, after his suicide,) this young man
returned to Milton, and went quietly round to each creditor, paying him
the first instalment of the money owing to him. No noise--no gathering
together of creditors--it was done very silently and quietly, but all
was paid at last; helped on materially by the circumstance of one of the
creditors, a crabbed old fellow (Mr. Bell says), taking in Mr. Thornton
as a kind of partner.'

'That really is fine,' said Margaret. 'What a pity such a nature should
be tainted by his position as a Milton manufacturer.'

'How tainted?' asked her father.

'Oh, papa, by that testing everything by the standard of wealth. When he
spoke of the mechanical powers, he evidently looked upon them only as
new ways of extending trade and making money. And the poor men around
him--they were poor because they were vicious--out of the pale of his
sympathies because they had not his iron nature, and the capabilities
that it gives him for being rich.'

'Not vicious; he never said that. Improvident and self-indulgent were
his words.'

Margaret was collecting her mother's working materials, and preparing to
go to bed. Just as she was leaving the room, she hesitated--she was
inclined to make an acknowledgment which she thought would please her
father, but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance.
However, out it came.

'Papa, I do think Mr. Thornton a very remarkable man; but personally I
don't like him at all.'

'And I do!' said her father laughing. 'Personally, as you call it, and
all. I don't set him up for a hero, or anything of that kind. But good
night, child. Your mother looks sadly tired to-night, Margaret.'

Margaret had noticed her mother's jaded appearance with anxiety for some
time past, and this remark of her father's sent her up to bed with a dim
fear lying like a weight on her heart. The life in Milton was so
different from what Mrs. Hale had been accustomed to live in Helstone,
in and out perpetually into the fresh and open air; the air itself was
so different, deprived of all revivifying principle as it seemed to be
here; the domestic worries pressed so very closely, and in so new and
sordid a form, upon all the women in the family, that there was good
reason to fear that her mother's health might be becoming seriously
affected. There were several other signs of something wrong about Mrs.
Hale. She and Dixon held mysterious consultations in her bedroom, from
which Dixon would come out crying and cross, as was her custom when any
distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy. Once Margaret had
gone into the chamber soon after Dixon left it, and found her mother on
her knees, and as Margaret stole out she caught a few words, which were
evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily
suffering. Margaret yearned to re-unite the bond of intimate confidence
which had been broken by her long residence at her aunt Shaw's, and
strove by gentle caresses and softened words to creep into the warmest
place in her mother's heart. But though she received caresses and fond
words back again, in such profusion as would have gladdened her
formerly, yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her, and
she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health. She lay
awake very long this night, planning how to lessen the evil influence of
their Milton life on her mother. A servant to give Dixon permanent
assistance should be got, if she gave up her whole time to the search;
and then, at any rate, her mother might have all the personal attention
she required, and had been accustomed to her whole life. Visiting
register offices, seeing all manner of unlikely people, and very few in
the least likely, absorbed Margaret's time and thoughts for several
days. One afternoon she met Bessy Higgins in the street, and stopped to
speak to her.

'Well, Bessy, how are you? Better, I hope, now the wind has changed.'

'Better and not better, if yo' know what that means.'

'Not exactly,' replied Margaret, smiling.

'I'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing o'nights, but I'm
weary and tired o' Milton, and longing to get away to the land o'
Beulah; and when I think I'm farther and farther off, my heart sinks,
and I'm no better; I'm worse.' Margaret turned round to walk alongside
of the girl in her feeble progress homeward. But for a minute or two she
did not speak. At last she said in a low voice,

'Bessy, do you wish to die?' For she shrank from death herself, with all
the clinging to life so natural to the young and healthy.

Bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two. Then she replied,

'If yo'd led the life I have, and getten as weary of it as I have, and
thought at times, "maybe it'll last for fifty or sixty years--it does
wi' some,"--and got dizzy and dazed, and sick, as each of them sixty
years seemed to spin about me, and mock me with its length of hours and
minutes, and endless bits o' time--oh, wench! I tell thee thou'd been
glad enough when th' doctor said he feared thou'd never see another
winter.'

'Why, Bessy, what kind of a life has yours been?'

'Nought worse than many others, I reckon. Only I fretted again it, and
they didn't.'

'But what was it? You know, I'm a stranger here, so perhaps I'm not so
quick at understanding what you mean as if I'd lived all my life at
Milton.'

'If yo'd ha' come to our house when yo' said yo' would, I could maybe
ha' told you. But father says yo're just like th' rest on 'em; it's out
o' sight out o' mind wi' you.'

'I don't know who the rest are; and I've been very busy; and, to tell
the truth, I had forgotten my promise--'

'Yo' offered it! we asked none of it.'

'I had forgotten what I said for the time,' continued Margaret quietly.
'I should have thought of it again when I was less busy. May I go with
you now?' Bessy gave a quick glance at Margaret's face, to see if the
wish expressed was really felt. The sharpness in her eye turned to a
wistful longing as she met Margaret's soft and friendly gaze.

'I ha' none so many to care for me; if yo' care yo' may come.

So they walked on together in silence. As they turned up into a small
court, opening out of a squalid street, Bessy said,

'Yo'll not be daunted if father's at home, and speaks a bit gruffish at
first. He took a mind to ye, yo' see, and he thought a deal o' your
coming to see us; and just because he liked yo' he were vexed and put
about.'

'Don't fear, Bessy.'

But Nicholas was not at home when they entered. A great slatternly girl,
not so old as Bessy, but taller and stronger, was busy at the wash-tub,
knocking about the furniture in a rough capable way, but altogether
making so much noise that Margaret shrunk, out of sympathy with poor
Bessy, who had sat down on the first chair, as if completely tired out
with her walk. Margaret asked the sister for a cup of water, and while
she ran to fetch it (knocking down the fire-irons, and tumbling over a
chair in her way), she unloosed Bessy's bonnet strings, to relieve her
catching breath.

'Do you think such life as this is worth caring for?' gasped Bessy, at
last. Margaret did not speak, but held the water to her lips. Bessy took
a long and feverish draught, and then fell back and shut her eyes.
Margaret heard her murmur to herself: 'They shall hunger no more,
neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any
heat.'

Margaret bent over and said, 'Bessy, don't be impatient with your life,
whatever it is--or may have been. Remember who gave it you, and made it
what it is!' She was startled by hearing Nicholas speak behind her; he
had come in without her noticing him.

'Now, I'll not have my wench preached to. She's bad enough as it is,
with her dreams and her methodee fancies, and her visions of cities with
goulden gates and precious stones. But if it amuses her I let it a be,
but I'm none going to have more stuff poured into her.'

'But surely,' said Margaret, facing round, 'you believe in what I said,
that God gave her life, and ordered what kind of life it was to be?'

'I believe what I see, and no more. That's what I believe, young woman.
I don't believe all I hear--no! not by a big deal. I did hear a young
lass make an ado about knowing where we lived, and coming to see us. And
my wench here thought a deal about it, and flushed up many a time, when
hoo little knew as I was looking at her, at the sound of a strange step.
But hoo's come at last,--and hoo's welcome, as long as hoo'll keep from
preaching on what hoo knows nought about.' Bessy had been watching
Margaret's face; she half sate up to speak now, laying her hand on
Margaret's arm with a gesture of entreaty. 'Don't be vexed wi'
him--there's many a one thinks like him; many and many a one here. If
yo' could hear them speak, yo'd not be shocked at him; he's a rare good
man, is father--but oh!' said she, falling back in despair, 'what he
says at times makes me long to die more than ever, for I want to know so
many things, and am so tossed about wi' wonder.'

'Poor wench--poor old wench,--I'm loth to vex thee, I am; but a man mun
speak out for the truth, and when I see the world going all wrong at
this time o' day, bothering itself wi' things it knows nought about, and
leaving undone all the things that lie in disorder close at its
hand--why, I say, leave a' this talk about religion alone, and set to
work on what yo' see and know. That's my creed. It's simple, and not far
to fetch, nor hard to work.'

But the girl only pleaded the more with Margaret.

'Don't think hardly on him--he's a good man, he is. I sometimes think I
shall be moped wi' sorrow even in the City of God, if father is not
there.' The feverish colour came into her cheek, and the feverish flame
into her eye. 'But you will be there, father! you shall! Oh! my heart!'
She put her hand to it, and became ghastly pale.

Margaret held her in her arms, and put the weary head to rest upon her
bosom. She lifted the thin soft hair from off the temples, and bathed
them with water. Nicholas understood all her signs for different
articles with the quickness of love, and even the round-eyed sister
moved with laborious gentleness at Margaret's 'hush!' Presently the
spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away, and Bessy roused herself
and said,--

'I'll go to bed,--it's best place; but,' catching at Margaret's gown,
'yo'll come again,--I know yo' will--but just say it!'

'I will come to-morrow,' said Margaret.

Bessy leant back against her father, who prepared to carry her upstairs;
but as Margaret rose to go, he struggled to say something: 'I could wish
there were a God, if it were only to ask Him to bless thee.'

Margaret went away very sad and thoughtful.

She was late for tea at home. At Helstone unpunctuality at meal-times
was a great fault in her mother's eyes; but now this, as well as many
other little irregularities, seemed to have lost their power of
irritation, and Margaret almost longed for the old complainings.

'Have you met with a servant, dear?'

'No, mamma; that Anne Buckley would never have done.'

'Suppose I try,' said Mr. Hale. 'Everybody else has had their turn at
this great difficulty. Now let me try. I may be the Cinderella to put on
the slipper after all.'

Margaret could hardly smile at this little joke, so oppressed was she by
her visit to the Higginses.

'What would you do, papa? How would you set about it?'

'Why, I would apply to some good house-mother to recommend me one known
to herself or her servants.'

'Very good. But we must first catch our house-mother.'

'You have caught her. Or rather she is coming into the snare, and you
will catch her to-morrow, if you're skilful.'

'What do you mean, Mr. Hale?' asked his wife, her curiosity aroused.

'Why, my paragon pupil (as Margaret calls him), has told me that his
mother intends to call on Mrs. and Miss Hale to-morrow.'

'Mrs. Thornton!' exclaimed Mrs. Hale.

'The mother of whom he spoke to us?' said Margaret.

'Mrs. Thornton; the only mother he has, I believe,' said Mr. Hale
quietly.

'I shall like to see her. She must be an uncommon person,' her mother
added.

'Perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us, and be glad of our
place. She sounded to be such a careful economical person, that I should
like any one out of the same family.'

'My dear,' said Mr. Hale alarmed. 'Pray don't go off on that idea. I
fancy Mrs. Thornton is as haughty and proud in her way, as our little
Margaret here is in hers, and that she completely ignores that old time
of trial, and poverty, and economy, of which he speaks so openly. I am
sure, at any rate, she would not like strangers to know anything about
It.'

'Take notice that is not my kind of haughtiness, papa, if I have any at
all; which I don't agree to, though you're always accusing me of it.'

'I don't know positively that it is hers either; but from little things
I have gathered from him, I fancy so.'

They cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about
her. Margaret only wanted to know if she must stay in to receive this
call, as it would prevent her going to see how Bessy was, until late in
the day, since the early morning was always occupied in household
affairs; and then she recollected that her mother must not be left to
have the whole weight of entertaining her visitor.




CHAPTER XII

MORNING CALLS

    'Well--I suppose we must.'
             FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.


Mr. Thornton had had some difficulty in working up his mother to the
desired point of civility. She did not often make calls; and when she
did, it was in heavy state that she went through her duties. Her son had
given her a carriage; but she refused to let him keep horses for it;
they were hired for the solemn occasions, when she paid morning or
evening visits. She had had horses for three days, not a fortnight
before, and had comfortably 'killed off' all her acquaintances, who
might now put themselves to trouble and expense in their turn. Yet
Crampton was too far off for her to walk; and she had repeatedly
questioned her son as to whether his wish that she should call on the
Hales was strong enough to bear the expense of cab-hire. She would have
been thankful if it had not; for, as she said, 'she saw no use in making
up friendships and intimacies with all the teachers and masters in
Milton; why, he would be wanting her to call on Fanny's dancing-master's
wife, the next thing!'

'And so I would, mother, if Mr. Mason and his wife were friendless in a
strange place, like the Hales.'

'Oh! you need not speak so hastily. I am going to-morrow. I only wanted
you exactly to understand about it.'

'If you are going to-morrow, I shall order horses.'

'Nonsense, John. One would think you were made of money.'

'Not quite, yet. But about the horses I'm determined. The last time you
were out in a cab, you came home with a headache from the jolting.'

'I never complained of it, I'm sure.'

'No. My mother is not given to complaints,' said he, a little proudly.
'But so much the more I have to watch over you. Now as for Fanny there,
a little hardship would do her good.'

'She is not made of the same stuff as you are, John. She could not bear
it.' Mrs. Thornton was silent after this; for her last words bore
relation to a subject which mortified her. She had an unconscious
contempt for a weak character; and Fanny was weak in the very points in
which her mother and brother were strong. Mrs. Thornton was not a woman
much given to reasoning; her quick judgment and firm resolution served
her in good stead of any long arguments and discussions with herself;
she felt instinctively that nothing could strengthen Fanny to endure
hardships patiently, or face difficulties bravely; and though she winced
as she made this acknowledgment to herself about her daughter, it only
gave her a kind of pitying tenderness of manner towards her; much of the
same description of demeanour with which mothers are wont to treat their
weak and sickly children. A stranger, a careless observer might have
considered that Mrs. Thornton's manner to her children betokened far
more love to Fanny than to John. But such a one would have been deeply
mistaken. The very daringness with which mother and son spoke out
unpalatable truths, the one to the other, showed a reliance on the firm
centre of each other's souls, which the uneasy tenderness of Mrs.
Thornton's manner to her daughter, the shame with which she thought to
hide the poverty of her child in all the grand qualities which she
herself possessed unconsciously, and which she set so high a value upon
in others--this shame, I say, betrayed the want of a secure
resting-place for her affection. She never called her son by any name
but John; 'love,' and 'dear,' and such like terms, were reserved for
Fanny. But her heart gave thanks for him day and night; and she walked
proudly among women for his sake.

'Fanny dear I shall have horses to the carriage to-day, to go and call
on these Hales. Should not you go and see nurse? It's in the same
direction, and she's always so glad to see you. You could go on there
while I am at Mrs. Hale's.'

'Oh! mamma, it's such a long way, and I am so tired.'

'With what?' asked Mrs. Thornton, her brow slightly contracting.

'I don't know--the weather, I think. It is so relaxing. Couldn't you
bring nurse here, mamma? The carriage could fetch her, and she could
spend the rest of the day here, which I know she would like.'

Mrs. Thornton did not speak; but she laid her work on the table, and
seemed to think.

'It will be a long way for her to walk back at night!' she remarked, at
last.

'Oh, but I will send her home in a cab. I never thought of her walking.'
At this point, Mr. Thornton came in, just before going to the mill.

'Mother! I need hardly say, that if there is any little thing that could
serve Mrs. Hale as an invalid, you will offer it, I'm sure.'

'If I can find it out, I will. But I have never been ill myself, so I am
not much up to invalids' fancies.'

'Well! here is Fanny then, who is seldom without an ailment. She will be
able to suggest something, perhaps--won't you, Fan?'

'I have not always an ailment,' said Fanny, pettishly; 'and I am not
going with mamma. I have a headache to-day, and I shan't go out.'

Mr. Thornton looked annoyed. His mother's eyes were bent on her work, at
which she was now stitching away busily.

'Fanny! I wish you to go,' said he, authoritatively. 'It will do you
good, instead of harm. You will oblige me by going, without my saying
anything more about it.'

He went abruptly out of the room after saying this.

If he had staid a minute longer, Fanny would have cried at his tone of
command, even when he used the words, 'You will oblige me.' As it was,
she grumbled.

'John always speaks as if I fancied I was ill, and I am sure I never do
fancy any such thing. Who are these Hales that he makes such a fuss
about?'

'Fanny, don't speak so of your brother. He has good reasons of some kind
or other, or he would not wish us to go. Make haste and put your things
on.'

But the little altercation between her son and her daughter did not
incline Mrs. Thornton more favourably towards 'these Hales.' Her jealous
heart repeated her daughter's question, 'Who are they, that he is so
anxious we should pay them all this attention?' It came up like a burden
to a song, long after Fanny had forgotten all about it in the pleasant
excitement of seeing the effect of a new bonnet in the looking-glass.

Mrs. Thornton was shy. It was only of late years that she had had
leisure enough in her life to go into society; and as society she did
not enjoy it. As dinner-giving, and as criticising other people's
dinners, she took satisfaction in it. But this going to make
acquaintance with strangers was a very different thing. She was ill at
ease, and looked more than usually stern and forbidding as she entered
the Hales' little drawing-room.

Margaret was busy embroidering a small piece of cambric for some little
article of dress for Edith's expected baby--'Flimsy, useless work,' as
Mrs. Thornton observed to herself. She liked Mrs. Hale's double knitting
far better; that was sensible of its kind. The room altogether was full
of knick-knacks, which must take a long time to dust; and time to people
of limited income was money. She made all these reflections as she was
talking in her stately way to Mrs. Hale, and uttering all the
stereotyped commonplaces that most people can find to say with their
senses blindfolded. Mrs. Hale was making rather more exertion in her
answers, captivated by some real old lace which Mrs. Thornton wore;
'lace,' as she afterwards observed to Dixon, 'of that old English point
which has not been made for this seventy years, and which cannot be
bought. It must have been an heir-loom, and shows that she had
ancestors.' So the owner of the ancestral lace became worthy of
something more than the languid exertion to be agreeable to a visitor,
by which Mrs. Hale's efforts at conversation would have been otherwise
bounded. And presently, Margaret, racking her brain to talk to Fanny,
heard her mother and Mrs. Thornton plunge into the interminable subject
of servants.

'I suppose you are not musical,' said Fanny, 'as I see no piano.'

'I am fond of hearing good music; I cannot play well myself; and papa
and mamma don't care much about it; so we sold our old piano when we
came here.'

'I wonder how you can exist without one. It almost seems to me a
necessary of life.'

'Fifteen shillings a week, and three saved out of them!' thought
Margaret to herself 'But she must have been very young. She probably has
forgotten her own personal experience. But she must know of those days.'
Margaret's manner had an extra tinge of coldness in it when she next
spoke.

'You have good concerts here, I believe.'

'Oh, yes! Delicious! Too crowded, that is the worst. The directors admit
so indiscriminately. But one is sure to hear the newest music there. I
always have a large order to give to Johnson's, the day after a
concert.'

'Do you like new music simply for its newness, then?'

'Oh; one knows it is the fashion in London, or else the singers would
not bring it down here. You have been in London, of course.'

'Yes,' said Margaret, 'I have lived there for several years.'

'Oh! London and the Alhambra are the two places I long to see!'

'London and the Alhambra!'

'Yes! ever since I read the Tales of the Alhambra. Don't you know them?'

'I don't think I do. But surely, it is a very easy journey to London.'

'Yes; but somehow,' said Fanny, lowering her voice, 'mamma has never
been to London herself, and can't understand my longing. She is very
proud of Milton; dirty, smoky place, as I feel it to be. I believe she
admires it the more for those very qualities.'

'If it has been Mrs. Thornton's home for some years, I can well
understand her loving it,' said Margaret, in her clear bell-like voice.

'What are you saying about me, Miss Hale? May I inquire?'

Margaret had not the words ready for an answer to this question, which
took her a little by surprise, so Miss Thornton replied:

'Oh, mamma! we are only trying to account for your being so fond of
Milton.'

'Thank you,' said Mrs. Thornton. 'I do not feel that my very natural
liking for the place where I was born and brought up,--and which has
since been my residence for some years, requires any accounting for.'

Margaret was vexed. As Fanny had put it, it did seem as if they had been
impertinently discussing Mrs. Thornton's feelings; but she also rose up
against that lady's manner of showing that she was offended.

Mrs. Thornton went on after a moment's pause:

'Do you know anything of Milton, Miss Hale? Have you seen any of our
factories? our magnificent warehouses?'

'No!' said Margaret. 'I have not seen anything of that description as
yet.' Then she felt that, by concealing her utter indifference to all
such places, she was hardly speaking with truth; so she went on:

'I dare say, papa would have taken me before now if I had cared. But I
really do not find much pleasure in going over manufactories.'

'They are very curious places,' said Mrs. Hale, 'but there is so much
noise and dirt always. I remember once going in a lilac silk to see
candles made, and my gown was utterly ruined.'

'Very probably,' said Mrs. Thornton, in a short displeased manner. 'I
merely thought, that as strangers newly come to reside in a town which
has risen to eminence in the country, from the character and progress of
its peculiar business, you might have cared to visit some of the places
where it is carried on; places unique in the kingdom, I am informed. If
Miss Hale changes her mind and condescends to be curious as to the
manufactures of Milton, I can only say I shall be glad to procure her
admission to print-works, or reed-making, or the more simple operations
of spinning carried on in my son's mill. Every improvement of machinery
is, I believe, to be seen there, in its highest perfection.'

'I am so glad you don't like mills and manufactories, and all those kind
of things,' said Fanny, in a half-whisper, as she rose to accompany her
mother, who was taking leave of Mrs. Hale with rustling dignity.

'I think I should like to know all about them, if I were you,' replied
Margaret quietly.

'Fanny!' said her mother, as they drove away, 'we will be civil to these
Hales: but don't form one of your hasty friendships with the daughter.
She will do you no good, I see. The mother looks very ill, and seems a
nice, quiet kind of person.'

'I don't want to form any friendship with Miss Hale, mamma,' said Fanny,
pouting. 'I thought I was doing my duty by talking to her, and trying to
amuse her.'

'Well! at any rate John must be satisfied now.'




CHAPTER XIII

A SOFT BREEZE IN A SULTRY PLACE

    'That doubt and trouble, fear and pain,
     And anguish, all, are shadows vain,
     That death itself shall not remain;

     That weary deserts we may tread,
     A dreary labyrinth may thread,
     Thro' dark ways underground be led;

     Yet, if we will one Guide obey,
     The dreariest path, the darkest way
     Shall issue out in heavenly day;

     And we, on divers shores now cast,
     Shall meet, our perilous voyage past,
     All in our Father's house at last!'
            R. C. TRENCH.


Margaret flew upstairs as soon as their visitors were gone, and put on
her bonnet and shawl, to run and inquire how Bessy Higgins was, and sit
with her as long as she could before dinner. As she went along the
crowded narrow streets, she felt how much of interest they had gained by
the simple fact of her having learnt to care for a dweller in them.

Mary Higgins, the slatternly younger sister, had endeavoured as well as
she could to tidy up the house for the expected visit. There had been
rough-stoning done in the middle of the floor, while the flags under the
chairs and table and round the walls retained their dark unwashed
appearance. Although the day was hot, there burnt a large fire in the
grate, making the whole place feel like an oven. Margaret did not
understand that the lavishness of coals was a sign of hospitable welcome
to her on Mary's part, and thought that perhaps the oppressive heat was
necessary for Bessy. Bessy herself lay on a squab, or short sofa, placed
under the window. She was very much more feeble than on the previous
day, and tired with raising herself at every step to look out and see if
it was Margaret coming. And now that Margaret was there, and had taken a
chair by her, Bessy lay back silent, and content to look at Margaret's
face, and touch her articles of dress, with a childish admiration of
their fineness of texture.

'I never knew why folk in the Bible cared for soft raiment afore. But it
must be nice to go dressed as yo' do. It's different fro' common. Most
fine folk tire my eyes out wi' their colours; but some how yours rest
me. Where did ye get this frock?'

'In London,' said Margaret, much amused.

'London! Have yo' been in London?'

'Yes! I lived there for some years. But my home was in a forest; in the
country.

'Tell me about it,' said Bessy. 'I like to hear speak of the country and
trees, and such like things.' She leant back, and shut her eye and
crossed her hands over her breast, lying at perfect rest, as if to
receive all the ideas Margaret could suggest.

Margaret had never spoken of Helstone since she left it, except just
naming the place incidentally. She saw it in dreams more vivid than
life, and as she fell away to slumber at nights her memory wandered in
all its pleasant places. But her heart was opened to this girl; 'Oh,
Bessy, I loved the home we have left so dearly! I wish you could see it.
I cannot tell you half its beauty. There are great trees standing all
about it, with their branches stretching long and level, and making a
deep shade of rest even at noonday. And yet, though every leaf may seem
still, there is a continual rushing sound of movement all around--not
close at hand. Then sometimes the turf is as soft and fine as velvet;
and sometimes quite lush with the perpetual moisture of a little,
hidden, tinkling brook near at hand. And then in other parts there are
billowy ferns--whole stretches of fern; some in the green shadow; some
with long streaks of golden sunlight lying on them--just like the sea.'

'I have never seen the sea,' murmured Bessy. 'But go on.'

'Then, here and there, there are wide commons, high up as if above the
very tops of the trees--'

'I'm glad of that. I felt smothered like down below. When I have gone
for an out, I've always wanted to get high up and see far away, and take
a deep breath o' fulness in that air. I get smothered enough in Milton,
and I think the sound yo' speak of among the trees, going on for ever
and ever, would send me dazed; it's that made my head ache so in the
mill. Now on these commons I reckon there is but little noise?'

'No,' said Margaret; 'nothing but here and there a lark high in the air.
Sometimes I used to hear a farmer speaking sharp and loud to his
servants; but it was so far away that it only reminded me pleasantly
that other people were hard at work in some distant place, while I just
sat on the heather and did nothing.'

'I used to think once that if I could have a day of doing nothing, to
rest me--a day in some quiet place like that yo' speak on--it would
maybe set me up. But now I've had many days o' idleness, and I'm just as
weary o' them as I was o' my work. Sometimes I'm so tired out I think I
cannot enjoy heaven without a piece of rest first. I'm rather afeard o'
going straight there without getting a good sleep in the grave to set me
up.'

'Don't be afraid, Bessy,' said Margaret, laying her hand on the girl's;
'God can give you more perfect rest than even idleness on earth, or the
dead sleep of the grave can do.'

Bessy moved uneasily; then she said:

'I wish father would not speak as he does. He means well, as I telled
yo' yesterday, and tell yo' again and again. But yo' see, though I don't
believe him a bit by day, yet by night--when I'm in a fever, half-asleep
and half-awake--it comes back upon me--oh! so bad! And I think, if this
should be th' end of all, and if all I've been born for is just to work
my heart and my life away, and to sicken i' this dree place, wi' them
mill-noises in my ears for ever, until I could scream out for them to
stop, and let me have a little piece o' quiet--and wi' the fluff filling
my lungs, until I thirst to death for one long deep breath o' the clear
air yo' speak on--and my mother gone, and I never able to tell her again
how I loved her, and o' all my troubles--I think if this life is th'
end, and that there's no God to wipe away all tears from all eyes--yo'
wench, yo'!' said she, sitting up, and clutching violently, almost
fiercely, at Margaret's hand, 'I could go mad, and kill yo', I could.'
She fell back completely worn out with her passion. Margaret knelt down
by her.

'Bessy--we have a Father in Heaven.'

'I know it! I know it,' moaned she, turning her head uneasily from side
to side.

'I'm very wicked. I've spoken very wickedly. Oh! don't be frightened by
me and never come again. I would not harm a hair of your head. And,'
opening her eyes, and looking earnestly at Margaret, 'I believe,
perhaps, more than yo' do o' what's to come. I read the book o'
Revelations until I know it off by heart, and I never doubt when I'm
waking, and in my senses, of all the glory I'm to come to.'

'Don't let us talk of what fancies come into your head when you are
feverish. I would rather hear something about what you used to do when
you were well.'

'I think I was well when mother died, but I have never been rightly
strong sin' somewhere about that time. I began to work in a carding-room
soon after, and the fluff got into my lungs and poisoned me.'

'Fluff?' said Margaret, inquiringly.

'Fluff,' repeated Bessy. 'Little bits, as fly off fro' the cotton, when
they're carding it, and fill the air till it looks all fine white dust.
They say it winds round the lungs, and tightens them up. Anyhow, there's
many a one as works in a carding-room, that falls into a waste, coughing
and spitting blood, because they're just poisoned by the fluff.'

'But can't it be helped?' asked Margaret.

'I dunno. Some folk have a great wheel at one end o' their carding-rooms
to make a draught, and carry off th' dust; but that wheel costs a deal
o' money--five or six hundred pound, maybe, and brings in no profit; so
it's but a few of th' masters as will put 'em up; and I've heard tell o'
men who didn't like working places where there was a wheel, because they
said as how it mad 'em hungry, at after they'd been long used to
swallowing fluff, to go without it, and that their wage ought to be
raised if they were to work in such places. So between masters and men
th' wheels fall through. I know I wish there'd been a wheel in our
place, though.'

'Did not your father know about it?' asked Margaret.

'Yes! And he were sorry. But our factory were a good one on the whole;
and a steady likely set o' people; and father was afeard of letting me
go to a strange place, for though yo' would na think it now, many a one
then used to call me a gradely lass enough. And I did na like to be
reckoned nesh and soft, and Mary's schooling were to be kept up, mother
said, and father he were always liking to buy books, and go to lectures
o' one kind or another--all which took money--so I just worked on till I
shall ne'er get the whirr out o' my ears, or the fluff out o' my throat
i' this world. That's all.'

'How old are you?' asked Margaret.

'Nineteen, come July.'

'And I too am nineteen.' She thought, more sorrowfully than Bessy did,
of the contrast between them. She could not speak for a moment or two
for the emotion she was trying to keep down.

'About Mary,' said Bessy. 'I wanted to ask yo' to be a friend to her.
She's seventeen, but she's th' last on us. And I don't want her to go to
th' mill, and yet I dunno what she's fit for.'

'She could not do'--Margaret glanced unconsciously at the uncleaned
corners of the room--'She could hardly undertake a servant's place,
could she? We have an old faithful servant, almost a friend, who wants
help, but who is very particular; and it would not be right to plague
her with giving her any assistance that would really be an annoyance and
an irritation.'

'No, I see. I reckon yo're right. Our Mary's a good wench; but who has
she had to teach her what to do about a house? No mother, and me at the
mill till I were good for nothing but scolding her for doing badly what
I didn't know how to do a bit. But I wish she could ha' lived wi' yo',
for all that.'

'But even though she may not be exactly fitted to come and live with us
as a servant--and I don't know about that--I will always try and be a
friend to her for your sake, Bessy. And now I must go. I will come again
as soon as I can; but if it should not be to-morrow, or the next day, or
even a week or a fortnight hence, don't think I've forgotten you. I may
be busy.'

'I'll know yo' won't forget me again. I'll not mistrust yo' no more. But
remember, in a week or a fortnight I may be dead and buried!'

'I'll come as soon as I can, Bessy,' said Margaret, squeezing her hand
tight. 'But you'll let me know if you are worse.'

'Ay, that will I,' said Bessy, returning the pressure.

From that day forwards Mrs. Hale became more and more of a suffering
invalid. It was now drawing near to the anniversary of Edith's marriage,
and looking back upon the year's accumulated heap of troubles, Margaret
wondered how they had been borne. If she could have anticipated them,
how she would have shrunk away and hid herself from the coming time! And
yet day by day had, of itself, and by itself, been very
endurable--small, keen, bright little spots of positive enjoyment having
come sparkling into the very middle of sorrows. A year ago, or when she
first went to Helstone, and first became silently conscious of the
querulousness in her mother's temper, she would have groaned bitterly
over the idea of a long illness to be borne in a strange, desolate,
noisy, busy place, with diminished comforts on every side of the home
life. But with the increase of serious and just ground of complaint, a
new kind of patience had sprung up in her mother's mind. She was gentle
and quiet in intense bodily suffering, almost in proportion as she had
been restless and depressed when there had been no real cause for grief.
Mr. Hale was in exactly that stage of apprehension which, in men of his
stamp, takes the shape of wilful blindness. He was more irritated than
Margaret had ever known him at his daughter's expressed anxiety.

'Indeed, Margaret, you are growing fanciful! God knows I should be the
first to take the alarm if your mother were really ill; we always saw
when she had her headaches at Helstone, even without her telling us. She
looks quite pale and white when she is ill; and now she has a bright
healthy colour in her cheeks, just as she used to have when I first knew
her.'

'But, papa,' said Margaret, with hesitation, 'do you know, I think that
is the flush of pain.'

'Nonsense, Margaret. I tell you, you are too fanciful. You are the
person not well, I think. Send for the doctor to-morrow for yourself;
and then, if it will make your mind easier, he can see your mother.'

'Thank you, dear papa. It will make me happier, indeed.' And she went up
to him to kiss him. But he pushed her away--gently enough, but still as
if she had suggested unpleasant ideas, which he should be glad to get
rid of as readily as he could of her presence. He walked uneasily up and
down the room.

'Poor Maria!' said he, half soliloquising, 'I wish one could do right
without sacrificing others. I shall hate this town, and myself too, if
she---- Pray, Margaret, does your mother often talk to you of the old
places of Helstone, I mean?'

'No, papa,' said Margaret, sadly.

'Then, you see, she can't be fretting after them, eh? It has always been
a comfort to me to think that your mother was so simple and open that I
knew every little grievance she had. She never would conceal anything
seriously affecting her health from me: would she, eh, Margaret? I am
quite sure she would not. So don't let me hear of these foolish morbid
ideas. Come, give me a kiss, and run off to bed.'

But she heard him pacing about (racooning, as she and Edith used to call
it) long after her slow and languid undressing was finished--long after
she began to listen as she lay in bed.




CHAPTER XIV

THE MUTINY

    'I was used
     To sleep at nights as sweetly as a child,--
     Now if the wind blew rough, it made me start,
     And think of my poor boy tossing about
     Upon the roaring seas. And then I seemed
     To feel that it was hard to take him from me
     For such a little fault.'
             SOUTHEY.


It was a comfort to Margaret about this time, to find that her mother
drew more tenderly and intimately towards her than she had ever done
since the days of her childhood. She took her to her heart as a
confidential friend--the post Margaret had always longed to fill, and
had envied Dixon for being preferred to. Margaret took pains to respond
to every call made upon her for sympathy--and they were many--even when
they bore relation to trifles, which she would no more have noticed or
regarded herself than the elephant would perceive the little pin at his
feet, which yet he lifts carefully up at the bidding of his keeper. All
unconsciously Margaret drew near to a reward.

One evening, Mr. Hale being absent, her mother began to talk to her
about her brother Frederick, the very subject on which Margaret had
longed to ask questions, and almost the only one on which her timidity
overcame her natural openness. The more she wanted to hear about him,
the less likely she was to speak.

'Oh, Margaret, it was so windy last night! It came howling down the
chimney in our room! I could not sleep. I never can when there is such a
terrible wind. I got into a wakeful habit when poor Frederick was at
sea; and now, even if I don't waken all at once, I dream of him in some
stormy sea, with great, clear, glass-green walls of waves on either side
his ship, but far higher than her very masts, curling over her with that
cruel, terrible white foam, like some gigantic crested serpent. It is an
old dream, but it always comes back on windy nights, till I am thankful
to waken, sitting straight and stiff up in bed with my terror. Poor
Frederick! He is on land now, so wind can do him no harm. Though I did
think it might shake down some of those tall chimneys.'

'Where is Frederick now, mamma? Our letters are directed to the care of
Messrs. Barbour, at Cadiz, I know; but where is he himself?'

'I can't remember the name of the place, but he is not called Hale; you
must remember that, Margaret. Notice the F. D. in every corner of the
letters. He has taken the name of Dickenson. I wanted him to have been
called Beresford, to which he had a kind of right, but your father
thought he had better not. He might be recognised, you know, if he were
called by my name.'

'Mamma,' said Margaret, 'I was at Aunt Shaw's when it all happened; and
I suppose I was not old enough to be told plainly about it. But I should
like to know now, if I may--if it does not give you too much pain to
speak about it.'

'Pain! No,' replied Mrs. Hale, her cheek flushing. 'Yet it is pain to
think that perhaps I may never see my darling boy again. Or else he did
right, Margaret. They may say what they like, but I have his own letters
to show, and I'll believe him, though he is my son, sooner than any
court-martial on earth. Go to my little japan cabinet, dear, and in the
second left-hand drawer you will find a packet of letters.'

Margaret went. There were the yellow, sea-stained letters, with the
peculiar fragrance which ocean letters have: Margaret carried them back
to her mother, who untied the silken string with trembling fingers, and,
examining their dates, she gave them to Margaret to read, making her
hurried, anxious remarks on their contents, almost before her daughter
could have understood what they were.

'You see, Margaret, how from the very first he disliked Captain Reid. He
was second lieutenant in the ship--the Orion--in which Frederick sailed
the very first time. Poor little fellow, how well he looked in his
midshipman's dress, with his dirk in his hand, cutting open all the
newspapers with it as if it were a paper-knife! But this Mr. Reid, as he
was then, seemed to take a dislike to Frederick from the very beginning.
And then--stay! these are the letters he wrote on board the Russell.
When he was appointed to her, and found his old enemy Captain Reid in
command, he did mean to bear all his tyranny patiently. Look! this is
the letter. Just read it, Margaret. Where is it he says--Stop--'my
father may rely upon me, that I will bear with all proper patience
everything that one officer and gentleman can take from another. But
from my former knowledge of my present captain, I confess I look forward
with apprehension to a long course of tyranny on board the Russell.' You
see, he promises to bear patiently, and I am sure he did, for he was the
sweetest-tempered boy, when he was not vexed, that could possibly be. Is
that the letter in which he speaks of Captain Reid's impatience with the
men, for not going through the ship's manoeuvres as quickly as the
Avenger? You see, he says that they had many new hands on board the
Russell, while the Avenger had been nearly three years on the station,
with nothing to do but to keep slavers off, and work her men, till they
ran up and down the rigging like rats or monkeys.'

Margaret slowly read the letter, half illegible through the fading of
the ink. It might be--it probably was--a statement of Captain Reid's
imperiousness in trifles, very much exaggerated by the narrator, who had
written it while fresh and warm from the scene of altercation. Some
sailors being aloft in the main-topsail rigging, the captain had ordered
them to race down, threatening the hindmost with the cat-of-nine-tails.
He who was the farthest on the spar, feeling the impossibility of
passing his companions, and yet passionately dreading the disgrace of
the flogging, threw himself desperately down to catch a rope
considerably lower, failed, and fell senseless on deck. He only survived
for a few hours afterwards, and the indignation of the ship's crew was
at boiling point when young Hale wrote.

'But we did not receive this letter till long, long after we heard of
the mutiny. Poor Fred! I dare say it was a comfort to him to write it
even though he could not have known how to send it, poor fellow! And
then we saw a report in the papers--that's to say, long before Fred's
letter reached us--of an atrocious mutiny having broken out on board the
Russell, and that the mutineers had remained in possession of the ship,
which had gone off, it was supposed, to be a pirate; and that Captain
Reid was sent adrift in a boat with some men--officers or
something--whose names were all given, for they were picked up by a
West-Indian steamer. Oh, Margaret! how your father and I turned sick
over that list, when there was no name of Frederick Hale. We thought it
must be some mistake; for poor Fred was such a fine fellow, only perhaps
rather too passionate; and we hoped that the name of Carr, which was in
the list, was a misprint for that of Hale--newspapers are so careless.
And towards post-time the next day, papa set off to walk to Southampton
to get the papers; and I could not stop at home, so I went to meet him.
He was very late--much later than I thought he would have been; and I
sat down under the hedge to wait for him. He came at last, his arms
hanging loose down, his head sunk, and walking heavily along, as if
every step was a labour and a trouble. Margaret, I see him now.'

'Don't go on, mamma. I can understand it all,' said Margaret, leaning up
caressingly against her mother's side, and kissing her hand.

'No, you can't, Margaret. No one can who did not see him then. I could
hardly lift myself up to go and meet him--everything seemed so to reel
around me all at once. And when I got to him, he did not speak, or seem
surprised to see me there, more than three miles from home, beside the
Oldham beech-tree; but he put my arm in his, and kept stroking my hand,
as if he wanted to soothe me to be very quiet under some great heavy
blow; and when I trembled so all over that I could not speak, he took me
in his arms, and stooped down his head on mine, and began to shake and
to cry in a strange muffled, groaning voice, till I, for very fright,
stood quite still, and only begged him to tell me what he had heard. And
then, with his hand jerking, as if some one else moved it against his
will, he gave me a wicked newspaper to read, calling our Frederick a
"traitor of the blackest dye," "a base, ungrateful disgrace to his
profession." Oh! I cannot tell what bad words they did not use. I took
the paper in my hands as soon as I had read it--I tore it up to little
bits--I tore it--oh! I believe Margaret, I tore it with my teeth. I did
not cry. I could not. My cheeks were as hot as fire, and my very eyes
burnt in my head. I saw your father looking grave at me. I said it was a
lie, and so it was. Months after, this letter came, and you see what
provocation Frederick had. It was not for himself, or his own injuries,
he rebelled; but he would speak his mind to Captain Reid, and so it went
on from bad to worse; and you see, most of the sailors stuck by
Frederick.

'I think, Margaret,' she continued, after a pause, in a weak, trembling,
exhausted voice, 'I am glad of it--I am prouder of Frederick standing up
against injustice, than if he had been simply a good officer.'

'I am sure I am,' said Margaret, in a firm, decided tone. 'Loyalty and
obedience to wisdom and justice are fine; but it is still finer to defy
arbitrary power, unjustly and cruelly used-not on behalf of ourselves,
but on behalf of others more helpless.'

'For all that, I wish I could see Frederick once more--just once. He was
my first baby, Margaret.' Mrs. Hale spoke wistfully, and almost as if
apologising for the yearning, craving wish, as though it were a
depreciation of her remaining child. But such an idea never crossed
Margaret's mind. She was thinking how her mother's desire could be
fulfilled.

'It is six or seven years ago--would they still prosecute him, mother?
If he came and stood his trial, what would be the punishment? Surely, he
might bring evidence of his great provocation.'

'It would do no good,' replied Mrs. Hale. 'Some of the sailors who
accompanied Frederick were taken, and there was a court-martial held on
them on board the Amicia; I believed all they said in their defence,
poor fellows, because it just agreed with Frederick's story--but it was
of no use,--' and for the first time during the conversation Mrs. Hale
began to cry; yet something possessed Margaret to force the information
she foresaw, yet dreaded, from her mother.

'What happened to them, mamma?' asked she.

'They were hung at the yard-arm,' said Mrs. Hale, solemnly. 'And the
worst was that the court, in condemning them to death, said they had
suffered themselves to be led astray from their duty by their superior
officers.'

They were silent for a long time.

'And Frederick was in South America for several years, was he not?'

'Yes. And now he is in Spain. At Cadiz, or somewhere near it. If he
comes to England he will be hung. I shall never see his face again--for
if he comes to England he will be hung.'

There was no comfort to be given. Mrs. Hale turned her face to the wall,
and lay perfectly still in her mother's despair. Nothing could be said
to console her. She took her hand out of Margaret's with a little
impatient movement, as if she would fain be left alone with the
recollection of her son. When Mr. Hale came in, Margaret went out,
oppressed with gloom, and seeing no promise of brightness on any side of
the horizon.




CHAPTER XV

MASTERS AND MEN

    'Thought fights with thought;
     out springs a spark of truth
     From the collision of the sword and shield.'
           W. S. LANDOR.


'Margaret,' said her father, the next day, 'we must return Mrs.
Thornton's call. Your mother is not very well, and thinks she cannot
walk so far; but you and I will go this afternoon.'

As they went, Mr. Hale began about his wife's health, with a kind of
veiled anxiety, which Margaret was glad to see awakened at last.

'Did you consult the doctor, Margaret? Did you send for him?'

'No, papa, you spoke of his coming to see me. Now I was well. But if I
only knew of some good doctor, I would go this afternoon, and ask him to
come, for I am sure mamma is seriously indisposed.'

She put the truth thus plainly and strongly because her father had so
completely shut his mind against the idea, when she had last named her
fears. But now the case was changed. He answered in a despondent tone:

'Do you think she has any hidden complaint? Do you think she is really
very ill? Has Dixon said anything? Oh, Margaret! I am haunted by the
fear that our coming to Milton has killed her. My poor Maria!'

'Oh, papa! don't imagine such things,' said Margaret, shocked. 'She is
not well, that is all. Many a one is not well for a time; and with good
advice gets better and stronger than ever.'

'But has Dixon said anything about her?'

'No! You know Dixon enjoys making a mystery out of trifles; and she has
been a little mysterious about mamma's health, which has alarmed me
rather, that is all. Without any reason, I dare say. You know, papa, you
said the other day I was getting fanciful.'

'I hope and trust you are. But don't think of what I said then. I like
you to be fanciful about your mother's health. Don't be afraid of
telling me your fancies. I like to hear them, though, I dare say, I
spoke as if I was annoyed. But we will ask Mrs. Thornton if she can tell
us of a good doctor. We won't throw away our money on any but some one
first-rate. Stay, we turn up this street.' The street did not look as if
it could contain any house large enough for Mrs. Thornton's habitation.
Her son's presence never gave any impression as to the kind of house he
lived in; but, unconsciously, Margaret had imagined that tall, massive,
handsomely dressed Mrs. Thornton must live in a house of the same
character as herself. Now Marlborough Street consisted of long rows of
small houses, with a blank wall here and there; at least that was all
they could see from the point at which they entered it.

'He told me he lived in Marlborough Street, I'm sure,' said Mr. Hale,
with a much perplexed air.

'Perhaps it is one of the economies he still practises, to live in a
very small house. But here are plenty of people about; let me ask.'

She accordingly inquired of a passer-by, and was informed that Mr.
Thornton lived close to the mill, and had the factory lodge-door pointed
out to her, at the end of the long dead wall they had noticed.

The lodge-door was like a common garden-door; on one side of it were
great closed gates for the ingress and egress of lorries and wagons. The
lodge-keeper admitted them into a great oblong yard, on one side of
which were offices for the transaction of business; on the opposite, an
immense many-windowed mill, whence proceeded the continual clank of
machinery and the long groaning roar of the steam-engine, enough to
deafen those who lived within the enclosure. Opposite to the wall, along
which the street ran, on one of the narrow sides of the oblong, was a
handsome stone-coped house,--blackened, to be sure, by the smoke, but
with paint, windows, and steps kept scrupulously clean. It was evidently
a house which had been built some fifty or sixty years. The stone
facings--the long, narrow windows, and the number of them--the flights
of steps up to the front door, ascending from either side, and guarded
by railing--all witnessed to its age. Margaret only wondered why people
who could afford to live in so good a house, and keep it in such perfect
order, did not prefer a much smaller dwelling in the country, or even
some suburb; not in the continual whirl and din of the factory. Her
unaccustomed ears could hardly catch her father's voice, as they stood
on the steps awaiting the opening of the door. The yard, too, with the
great doors in the dead wall as a boundary, was but a dismal look-out
for the sitting-rooms of the house--as Margaret found when they had
mounted the old-fashioned stairs, and been ushered into the
drawing-room, the three windows of which went over the front door and
the room on the right-hand side of the entrance. There was no one in the
drawing-room. It seemed as though no one had been in it since the day
when the furniture was bagged up with as much care as if the house was
to be overwhelmed with lava, and discovered a thousand years hence. The
walls were pink and gold; the pattern on the carpet represented bunches
of flowers on a light ground, but it was carefully covered up in the
centre by a linen drugget, glazed and colourless. The window-curtains
were lace; each chair and sofa had its own particular veil of netting,
or knitting. Great alabaster groups occupied every flat surface, safe
from dust under their glass shades. In the middle of the room, right
under the bagged-up chandelier, was a large circular table, with
smartly-bound books arranged at regular intervals round the
circumference of its polished surface, like gaily-coloured spokes of a
wheel. Everything reflected light, nothing absorbed it. The whole room
had a painfully spotted, spangled, speckled look about it, which
impressed Margaret so unpleasantly that she was hardly conscious of the
peculiar cleanliness required to keep everything so white and pure in
such an atmosphere, or of the trouble that must be willingly expended to
secure that effect of icy, snowy discomfort. Wherever she looked there
was evidence of care and labour, but not care and labour to procure
ease, to help on habits of tranquil home employment; solely to ornament,
and then to preserve ornament from dirt or destruction.

They had leisure to observe, and to speak to each other in low voices,
before Mrs. Thornton appeared. They were talking of what all the world
might hear; but it is a common effect of such a room as this to make
people speak low, as if unwilling to awaken the unused echoes.

At last Mrs. Thornton came in, rustling in handsome black silk, as was
her wont; her muslins and laces rivalling, not excelling, the pure
whiteness of the muslins and netting of the room. Margaret explained how
it was that her mother could not accompany them to return Mrs.
Thornton's call; but in her anxiety not to bring back her father's fears
too vividly, she gave but a bungling account, and left the impression on
Mrs. Thornton's mind that Mrs. Hale's was some temporary or fanciful
fine-ladyish indisposition, which might have been put aside had there
been a strong enough motive; or that if it was too severe to allow her
to come out that day, the call might have been deferred. Remembering,
too, the horses to her carriage, hired for her own visit to the Hales,
and how Fanny had been ordered to go by Mr. Thornton, in order to pay
every respect to them, Mrs. Thornton drew up slightly offended, and gave
Margaret no sympathy--indeed, hardly any credit for the statement of her
mother's indisposition.

'How is Mr. Thornton?' asked Mr. Hale. 'I was afraid he was not well,
from his hurried note yesterday.'

'My son is rarely ill; and when he is, he never speaks about it, or
makes it an excuse for not doing anything. He told me he could not get
leisure to read with you last night, sir. He regretted it, I am sure; he
values the hours spent with you.'

'I am sure they are equally agreeable to me,' said Mr. Hale. 'It makes
me feel young again to see his enjoyment and appreciation of all that is
fine in classical literature.'

'I have no doubt the classics are very desirable for people who have
leisure. But, I confess, it was against my judgment that my son renewed
his study of them. The time and place in which he lives, seem to me to
require all his energy and attention. Classics may do very well for men
who loiter away their lives in the country or in colleges; but Milton
men ought to have their thoughts and powers absorbed in the work of
to-day. At least, that is my opinion.' This last clause she gave out
with 'the pride that apes humility.'

'But, surely, if the mind is too long directed to one object only, it
will get stiff and rigid, and unable to take in many interests,' said
Margaret.

'I do not quite understand what you mean by a mind getting stiff and
rigid. Nor do I admire those whirligig characters that are full of this
thing to-day, to be utterly forgetful of it in their new interest
to-morrow. Having many interests does not suit the life of a Milton
manufacturer. It is, or ought to be, enough for him to have one great
desire, and to bring all the purposes of his life to bear on the
fulfilment of that.'

'And that is--?' asked Mr. Hale.

Her sallow cheek flushed, and her eye lightened, as she answered:

'To hold and maintain a high, honourable place among the merchants of
his country--the men of his town. Such a place my son has earned for
himself. Go where you will--I don't say in England only, but in
Europe--the name of John Thornton of Milton is known and respected
amongst all men of business. Of course, it is unknown in the fashionable
circles,' she continued, scornfully. 'Idle gentlemen and ladies are not
likely to know much of a Milton manufacturer, unless he gets into
parliament, or marries a lord's daughter.'

Both Mr. Hale and Margaret had an uneasy, ludicrous consciousness that
they had never heard of this great name, until Mr. Bell had written them
word that Mr. Thornton would be a good friend to have in Milton. The
proud mother's world was not their world of Harley Street gentilities
on the one hand, or country clergymen and Hampshire squires on the other.
Margaret's face, in spite of all her endeavours to keep it simply listening
in its expression told the sensitive Mrs. Thornton this feeling of hers.

'You think you never heard of this wonderful son of mine, Miss Hale. You
think I'm an old woman whose ideas are bounded by Milton, and whose own
crow is the whitest ever seen.'

'No,' said Margaret, with some spirit. 'It may be true, that I was
thinking I had hardly heard Mr. Thornton's name before I came to Milton.
But since I have come here, I have heard enough to make me respect and
admire him, and to feel how much justice and truth there is in what you
have said of him.'

'Who spoke to you of him?' asked Mrs. Thornton, a little mollified, yet
jealous lest any one else's words should not have done him full justice.
Margaret hesitated before she replied. She did not like this
authoritative questioning. Mr. Hale came in, as he thought, to the
rescue.

'It was what Mr. Thornton said himself, that made us know the kind of
man he was. Was it not, Margaret?'

Mrs. Thornton drew herself up, and said--

'My son is not the one to tell of his own doings. May I again ask you,
Miss Hale, from whose account you formed your favourable opinion of him?
A mother is curious and greedy of commendation of her children, you
know.'

Margaret replied, 'It was as much from what Mr. Thornton withheld of
that which we had been told of his previous life by Mr. Bell,--it was
more that than what he said, that made us all feel what reason you have
to be proud of him.'

'Mr. Bell! What can he know of John? He, living a lazy life in a drowsy
college. But I'm obliged to you, Miss Hale. Many a missy young lady
would have shrunk from giving an old woman the pleasure of hearing that
her son was well spoken of.'

'Why?' asked Margaret, looking straight at Mrs. Thornton, in
bewilderment.

'Why! because I suppose they might have consciences that told them how
surely they were making the old mother into an advocate for them, in
case they had any plans on the son's heart.'

She smiled a grim smile, for she had been pleased by Margaret's
frankness; and perhaps she felt that she had been asking questions too
much as if she had a right to catechise. Margaret laughed outright at
the notion presented to her; laughed so merrily that it grated on Mrs.
Thornton's ear, as if the words that called forth that laugh, must have
been utterly and entirely ludicrous. Margaret stopped her merriment as
soon as she saw Mrs. Thornton's annoyed look.

'I beg your pardon, madam. But I really am very much obliged to you for
exonerating me from making any plans on Mr. Thornton's heart.'

'Young ladies have, before now,' said Mrs. Thornton, stiffly.

'I hope Miss Thornton is well,' put in Mr. Hale, desirous of changing
the current of the conversation.

'She is as well as she ever is. She is not strong,' replied Mrs.
Thornton, shortly.

'And Mr. Thornton? I suppose I may hope to see him on Thursday?'

'I cannot answer for my son's engagements. There is some uncomfortable
work going on in the town; a threatening of a strike. If so, his
experience and judgment will make him much consulted by his friends. But
I should think he could come on Thursday. At any rate, I am sure he will
let you know if he cannot.'

'A strike!' asked Margaret. 'What for? What are they going to strike
for?'

'For the mastership and ownership of other people's property,' said Mrs.
Thornton, with a fierce snort. 'That is what they always strike for. If
my son's work-people strike, I will only say they are a pack of
ungrateful hounds. But I have no doubt they will.'

'They are wanting higher wages, I suppose?' asked Mr. Hale.

'That is the face of the thing. But the truth is, they want to be
masters, and make the masters into slaves on their own ground. They are
always trying at it; they always have it in their minds and every five
or six years, there comes a struggle between masters and men. They'll
find themselves mistaken this time, I fancy,--a little out of their
reckoning. If they turn out, they mayn't find it so easy to go in again.
I believe, the masters have a thing or two in their heads which will
teach the men not to strike again in a hurry, if they try it this time.'

'Does it not make the town very rough?' asked Margaret.

'Of course it does. But surely you are not a coward, are you? Milton is
not the place for cowards. I have known the time when I have had to
thread my way through a crowd of white, angry men, all swearing they
would have Makinson's blood as soon as he ventured to show his nose out
of his factory; and he, knowing nothing of it, some one had to go and
tell him, or he was a dead man, and it needed to be a woman,--so I went.
And when I had got in, I could not get out. It was as much as my life
was worth. So I went up to the roof, where there were stones piled ready
to drop on the heads of the crowd, if they tried to force the factory
doors. And I would have lifted those heavy stones, and dropped them with
as good an aim as the best man there, but that I fainted with the heat I
had gone through. If you live in Milton, you must learn to have a brave
heart, Miss Hale.'

'I would do my best,' said Margaret rather pale. 'I do not know whether
I am brave or not till I am tried; but I am afraid I should be a
coward.'

'South country people are often frightened by what our Darkshire men and
women only call living and struggling. But when you've been ten years
among a people who are always owing their betters a grudge, and only
waiting for an opportunity to pay it off, you'll know whether you are a
coward or not, take my word for it.'

Mr. Thornton came that evening to Mr. Hale's. He was shown up into the
drawing-room, where Mr. Hale was reading aloud to his wife and daughter.

'I am come partly to bring you a note from my mother, and partly to
apologise for not keeping to my time yesterday. The note contains the
address you asked for; Dr. Donaldson.'

'Thank you!' said Margaret, hastily, holding out her hand to take the
note, for she did not wish her mother to hear that they had been making
any inquiry about a doctor. She was pleased that Mr. Thornton seemed
immediately to understand her feeling; he gave her the note without
another word of explanation. Mr. Hale began to talk about the strike.
Mr. Thornton's face assumed a likeness to his mother's worst expression,
which immediately repelled the watching Margaret.

'Yes; the fools will have a strike. Let them. It suits us well enough.
But we gave them a chance. They think trade is flourishing as it was
last year. We see the storm on the horizon and draw in our sails. But
because we don't explain our reasons, they won't believe we're acting
reasonably. We must give them line and letter for the way we choose to
spend or save our money. Henderson tried a dodge with his men, out at
Ashley, and failed. He rather wanted a strike; it would have suited his
book well enough. So when the men came to ask for the five per cent.
they are claiming, he told 'em he'd think about it, and give them his
answer on the pay day; knowing all the while what his answer would be,
of course, but thinking he'd strengthen their conceit of their own way.
However, they were too deep for him, and heard something about the bad
prospects of trade. So in they came on the Friday, and drew back their
claim, and now he's obliged to go on working. But we Milton masters have
to-day sent in our decision. We won't advance a penny. We tell them we
may have to lower wages; but can't afford to raise. So here we stand,
waiting for their next attack.'

'And what will that be?' asked Mr. Hale.

'I conjecture, a simultaneous strike. You will see Milton without smoke
in a few days, I imagine, Miss Hale.'

'But why,' asked she, 'could you not explain what good reason you have
for expecting a bad trade? I don't know whether I use the right words,
but you will understand what I mean.'

'Do you give your servants reasons for your expenditure, or your economy
in the use of your own money? We, the owners of capital, have a right to
choose what we will do with it.'

'A human right,' said Margaret, very low.

'I beg your pardon, I did not hear what you said.'

'I would rather not repeat it,' said she; 'it related to a feeling which
I do not think you would share.'

'Won't you try me?' pleaded he; his thoughts suddenly bent upon learning
what she had said. She was displeased with his pertinacity, but did not
choose to affix too much importance to her words.

'I said you had a human right. I meant that there seemed no reason but
religious ones, why you should not do what you like with your own.

'I know we differ in our religious opinions; but don't you give me
credit for having some, though not the same as yours?'

He was speaking in a subdued voice, as if to her alone. She did not wish
to be so exclusively addressed. She replied out in her usual tone:

'I do not think that I have any occasion to consider your special
religious opinions in the affair. All I meant to say is, that there is
no human law to prevent the employers from utterly wasting or throwing
away all their money, if they choose; but that there are passages in the
Bible which would rather imply--to me at least--that they neglected
their duty as stewards if they did so. However I know so little about
strikes, and rate of wages, and capital, and labour, that I had better
not talk to a political economist like you.'

'Nay, the more reason,' said he, eagerly. 'I shall only be too glad to
explain to you all that may seem anomalous or mysterious to a stranger;
especially at a time like this, when our doings are sure to be canvassed
by every scribbler who can hold a pen.'

'Thank you,' she answered, coldly. 'Of course, I shall apply to my
father in the first instance for any information he can give me, if I
get puzzled with living here amongst this strange society.'

'You think it strange. Why?'

'I don't know--I suppose because, on the very face of it, I see two
classes dependent on each other in every possible way, yet each
evidently regarding the interests of the other as opposed to their own;
I never lived in a place before where there were two sets of people
always running each other down.'

'Who have you heard running the masters down? I don't ask who you have
heard abusing the men; for I see you persist in misunderstanding what I
said the other day. But who have you heard abusing the masters?'

Margaret reddened; then smiled as she said,

'I am not fond of being catechised. I refuse to answer your question.
Besides, it has nothing to do with the fact. You must take my word for
it, that I have heard some people, or, it may be, only someone of the
workpeople, speak as though it were the interest of the employers to
keep them from acquiring money--that it would make them too independent
if they had a sum in the savings' bank.'

'I dare say it was that man Higgins who told you all this,' said Mrs
Hale. Mr. Thornton did not appear to hear what Margaret evidently did
not wish him to know. But he caught it, nevertheless.

'I heard, moreover, that it was considered to the advantage of the
masters to have ignorant workmen--not hedge-lawyers, as Captain Lennox
used to call those men in his company who questioned and would know the
reason for every order.' This latter part of her sentence she addressed
rather to her father than to Mr. Thornton. Who is Captain Lennox? asked
Mr. Thornton of himself, with a strange kind of displeasure, that
prevented him for the moment from replying to her! Her father took up
the conversation.

'You never were fond of schools, Margaret, or you would have seen and
known before this, how much is being done for education in Milton.'

'No!' said she, with sudden meekness. 'I know I do not care enough about
schools. But the knowledge and the ignorance of which I was speaking,
did not relate to reading and writing,--the teaching or information one
can give to a child. I am sure, that what was meant was ignorance of the
wisdom that shall guide men and women. I hardly know what that is. But
he--that is, my informant--spoke as if the masters would like their
hands to be merely tall, large children--living in the present
moment--with a blind unreasoning kind of obedience.'

'In short, Miss Hale, it is very evident that your informant found a
pretty ready listener to all the slander he chose to utter against the
masters,' said Mr. Thornton, in an offended tone.

Margaret did not reply. She was displeased at the personal character Mr.
Thornton affixed to what she had said.

Mr. Hale spoke next:

'I must confess that, although I have not become so intimately
acquainted with any workmen as Margaret has, I am very much struck by
the antagonism between the employer and the employed, on the very
surface of things. I even gather this impression from what you yourself
have from time to time said.'

Mr. Thornton paused awhile before he spoke. Margaret had just left the
room, and he was vexed at the state of feeling between himself and her.
However, the little annoyance, by making him cooler and more thoughtful,
gave a greater dignity to what he said:

'My theory is, that my interests are identical with those of my
workpeople and vice-versa. Miss Hale, I know, does not like to hear men
called 'hands,' so I won't use that word, though it comes most readily
to my lips as the technical term, whose origin, whatever it was, dates
before my time. On some future day--in some millennium--in Utopia, this
unity may be brought into practice--just as I can fancy a republic the
most perfect form of government.'

'We will read Plato's Republic as soon as we have finished Homer.'

'Well, in the Platonic year, it may fall out that we are all--men women,
and children--fit for a republic: but give me a constitutional monarchy
in our present state of morals and intelligence. In our infancy we
require a wise despotism to govern us. Indeed, long past infancy,
children and young people are the happiest under the unfailing laws of a
discreet, firm authority. I agree with Miss Hale so far as to consider
our people in the condition of children, while I deny that we, the
masters, have anything to do with the making or keeping them so. I
maintain that despotism is the best kind of government for them; so that
in the hours in which I come in contact with them I must necessarily be
an autocrat. I will use my best discretion--from no humbug or
philanthropic feeling, of which we have had rather too much in the
North--to make wise laws and come to just decisions in the conduct of my
business--laws and decisions which work for my own good in the first
instance--for theirs in the second; but I will neither be forced to give
my reasons, nor flinch from what I have once declared to be my
resolution. Let them turn out! I shall suffer as well as they: but at
the end they will find I have not bated nor altered one jot.'

Margaret had re-entered the room and was sitting at her work; but she
did not speak. Mr. Hale answered--

'I dare say I am talking in great ignorance; but from the little I know,
I should say that the masses were already passing rapidly into the
troublesome stage which intervenes between childhood and manhood, in the
life of the multitude as well as that of the individual. Now, the error
which many parents commit in the treatment of the individual at this
time is, insisting on the same unreasoning obedience as when all he had
to do in the way of duty was, to obey the simple laws of "Come when
you're called" and "Do as you're bid!" But a wise parent humours the
desire for independent action, so as to become the friend and adviser
when his absolute rule shall cease. If I get wrong in my reasoning,
recollect, it is you who adopted the analogy.'

'Very lately,' said Margaret, 'I heard a story of what happened in
Nuremberg only three or four years ago. A rich man there lived alone in
one of the immense mansions which were formerly both dwellings and
warehouses. It was reported that he had a child, but no one knew of it
for certain. For forty years this rumour kept rising and falling--never
utterly dying away. After his death it was found to be true. He had a
son--an overgrown man with the unexercised intellect of a child, whom he
had kept up in that strange way, in order to save him from temptation
and error. But, of course, when this great old child was turned loose
into the world, every bad counsellor had power over him. He did not know
good from evil. His father had made the blunder of bringing him up in
ignorance and taking it for innocence; and after fourteen months of
riotous living, the city authorities had to take charge of him, in order
to save him from starvation. He could not even use words effectively
enough to be a successful beggar.'

'I used the comparison (suggested by Miss Hale) of the position of the
master to that of a parent; so I ought not to complain of your turning
the simile into a weapon against me. But, Mr. Hale, when you were
setting up a wise parent as a model for us, you said he humoured his
children in their desire for independent action. Now certainly, the time
is not come for the hands to have any independent action during business
hours; I hardly know what you would mean by it then. And I say, that the
masters would be trenching on the independence of their hands, in a way
that I, for one, should not feel justified in doing, if we interfered
too much with the life they lead out of the mills. Because they labour
ten hours a-day for us, I do not see that we have any right to impose
leading-strings upon them for the rest of their time. I value my own
independence so highly that I can fancy no degradation greater than that
of having another man perpetually directing and advising and lecturing
me, or even planning too closely in any way about my actions. He might
be the wisest of men, or the most powerful--I should equally rebel and
resent his interference I imagine this is a stronger feeling in the
North of England that in the South.'

'I beg your pardon, but is not that because there has been none of the
equality of friendship between the adviser and advised classes? Because
every man has had to stand in an unchristian and isolated position,
apart from and jealous of his brother-man: constantly afraid of his
rights being trenched upon?'

'I only state the fact. I am sorry to say, I have an appointment at
eight o'clock, and I must just take facts as I find them to-night,
without trying to account for them; which, indeed, would make no
difference in determining how to act as things stand--the facts must be
granted.'

'But,' said Margaret in a low voice, 'it seems to me that it makes all
the difference in the world--.' Her father made a sign to her to be
silent, and allow Mr. Thornton to finish what he had to say. He was
already standing up and preparing to go.

'You must grant me this one point. Given a strong feeling of
independence in every Darkshire man, have I any right to obtrude my
views, of the manner in which he shall act, upon another (hating it as I
should do most vehemently myself), merely because he has labour to sell
and I capital to buy?'

'Not in the least,' said Margaret, determined just to say this one
thing; 'not in the least because of your labour and capital positions,
whatever they are, but because you are a man, dealing with a set of men
over whom you have, whether you reject the use of it or not, immense
power, just because your lives and your welfare are so constantly and
intimately interwoven. God has made us so that we must be mutually
dependent. We may ignore our own dependence, or refuse to acknowledge
that others depend upon us in more respects than the payment of weekly
wages; but the thing must be, nevertheless. Neither you nor any other
master can help yourselves. The most proudly independent man depends on
those around him for their insensible influence on his character--his
life. And the most isolated of all your Darkshire Egos has dependants
clinging to him on all sides; he cannot shake them off, any more than
the great rock he resembles can shake off--'

'Pray don't go into similes, Margaret; you have led us off once
already,' said her father, smiling, yet uneasy at the thought that they
were detaining Mr. Thornton against his will, which was a mistake; for
he rather liked it, as long as Margaret would talk, although what she
said only irritated him.

'Just tell me, Miss Hale, are you yourself ever influenced--no, that is
not a fair way of putting it;--but if you are ever conscious of being
influenced by others, and not by circumstances, have those others been
working directly or indirectly? Have they been labouring to exhort, to
enjoin, to act rightly for the sake of example, or have they been
simple, true men, taking up their duty, and doing it unflinchingly,
without a thought of how their actions were to make this man
industrious, that man saving? Why, if I were a workman, I should be
twenty times more impressed by the knowledge that my master was honest,
punctual, quick, resolute in all his doings (and hands are keener spies
even than valets), than by any amount of interference, however kindly
meant, with my ways of going on out of work-hours. I do not choose to
think too closely on what I am myself; but, I believe, I rely on the
straightforward honesty of my hands, and the open nature of their
opposition, in contra-distinction to the way in which the turnout will
be managed in some mills, just because they know I scorn to take a
single dishonourable advantage, or do an underhand thing myself. It goes
farther than a whole course of lectures on "Honesty is the Best
Policy"--life diluted into words. No, no! What the master is, that will
the men be, without over-much taking thought on his part.'

'That is a great admission,' said Margaret, laughing. 'When I see men
violent and obstinate in pursuit of their rights, I may safely infer
that the master is the same that he is a little ignorant of that spirit
which suffereth long, and is kind, and seeketh not her own.'

'You are just like all strangers who don't understand the working of our
system, Miss Hale,' said he, hastily. 'You suppose that our men are
puppets of dough, ready to be moulded into any amiable form we please.
You forget we have only to do with them for less than a third of their
lives; and you seem not to perceive that the duties of a manufacturer
are far larger and wider than those merely of an employer of labour: we
have a wide commercial character to maintain, which makes us into the
great pioneers of civilisation.'

'It strikes me,' said Mr. Hale, smiling, 'that you might pioneer a
little at home. They are a rough, heathenish set of fellows, these
Milton men of yours.'

'They are that,' replied Mr. Thornton. 'Rosewater surgery won't do for
them. Cromwell would have made a capital mill-owner, Miss Hale. I wish
we had him to put down this strike for us.'

'Cromwell is no hero of mine,' said she, coldly. 'But I am trying to
reconcile your admiration of despotism with your respect for other men's
independence of character.'

He reddened at her tone. 'I choose to be the unquestioned and
irresponsible master of my hands, during the hours that they labour for
me. But those hours past, our relation ceases; and then comes in the
same respect for their independence that I myself exact.'

He did not speak again for a minute, he was too much vexed. But he shook
it off, and bade Mr. and Mrs. Hale good night. Then, drawing near to
Margaret, he said in a lower voice--

'I spoke hastily to you once this evening, and I am afraid, rather
rudely. But you know I am but an uncouth Milton manufacturer; will you
forgive me?'

'Certainly,' said she, smiling up in his face, the expression of which
was somewhat anxious and oppressed, and hardly cleared away as he met
her sweet sunny countenance, out of which all the north-wind effect of
their discussion had entirely vanished. But she did not put out her hand
to him, and again he felt the omission, and set it down to pride.




CHAPTER XVI

THE SHADOW OF DEATH

    'Trust in that veiled hand, which leads
     None by the path that he would go;
     And always be for change prepared,
     For the world's law is ebb and flow.'
             FROM THE ARABIC.


The next afternoon Dr. Donaldson came to pay his first visit to Mrs.
Hale. The mystery that Margaret hoped their late habits of intimacy had
broken through, was resumed. She was excluded from the room, while Dixon
was admitted. Margaret was not a ready lover, but where she loved she
loved passionately, and with no small degree of jealousy.

She went into her mother's bed-room, just behind the drawing-room, and
paced it up and down, while awaiting the doctor's coming out. Every now
and then she stopped to listen; she fancied she heard a moan. She
clenched her hands tight, and held her breath. She was sure she heard a
moan. Then all was still for a few minutes more; and then there was the
moving of chairs, the raised voices, all the little disturbances of
leave-taking.

When she heard the door open, she went quickly out of the bed-room.

'My father is from home, Dr. Donaldson; he has to attend a pupil at this
hour. May I trouble you to come into his room down stairs?'

She saw, and triumphed over all the obstacles which Dixon threw in her
way; assuming her rightful position as daughter of the house in
something of the spirit of the Elder Brother, which quelled the old
servant's officiousness very effectually. Margaret's conscious
assumption of this unusual dignity of demeanour towards Dixon, gave her
an instant's amusement in the midst of her anxiety. She knew, from the
surprised expression on Dixon's face, how ridiculously grand she herself
must be looking; and the idea carried her down stairs into the room; it
gave her that length of oblivion from the keen sharpness of the
recollection of the actual business in hand. Now, that came back, and
seemed to take away her breath. It was a moment or two before she could
utter a word.

But she spoke with an air of command, as she asked:--'

'What is the matter with mamma? You will oblige me by telling the simple
truth.' Then, seeing a slight hesitation on the doctor's part, she
added--

'I am the only child she has--here, I mean. My father is not
sufficiently alarmed, I fear; and, therefore, if there is any serious
apprehension, it must be broken to him gently. I can do this. I can
nurse my mother. Pray, speak, sir; to see your face, and not be able to
read it, gives me a worse dread than I trust any words of yours will
justify.'

'My dear young lady, your mother seems to have a most attentive and
efficient servant, who is more like her friend--'

'I am her daughter, sir.'

'But when I tell you she expressly desired that you might not be told--'

'I am not good or patient enough to submit to the prohibition. Besides,
I am sure you are too wise--too experienced to have promised to keep the
secret.'

'Well,' said he, half-smiling, though sadly enough, 'there you are
right. I did not promise. In fact, I fear, the secret will be known soon
enough without my revealing it.'

He paused. Margaret went very white, and compressed her lips a little
more. Otherwise not a feature moved. With the quick insight into
character, without which no medical man can rise to the eminence of Dr.
Donaldson, he saw that she would exact the full truth; that she would
know if one iota was withheld; and that the withholding would be torture
more acute than the knowledge of it. He spoke two short sentences in a
low voice, watching her all the time; for the pupils of her eyes dilated
into a black horror and the whiteness of her complexion became livid. He
ceased speaking. He waited for that look to go off,--for her gasping
breath to come. Then she said:--

'I thank you most truly, sir, for your confidence. That dread has
haunted me for many weeks. It is a true, real agony. My poor, poor
mother!' her lips began to quiver, and he let her have the relief of
tears, sure of her power of self-control to check them.

A few tears--those were all she shed, before she recollected the many
questions she longed to ask.

'Will there be much suffering?'

He shook his head. 'That we cannot tell. It depends on constitution; on
a thousand things. But the late discoveries of medical science have
given us large power of alleviation.'

'My father!' said Margaret, trembling all over.

'I do not know Mr. Hale. I mean, it is difficult to give advice. But I
should say, bear on, with the knowledge you have forced me to give you
so abruptly, till the fact which I could not with-hold has become in
some degree familiar to you, so that you may, without too great an
effort, be able to give what comfort you can to your father. Before
then,--my visits, which, of course, I shall repeat from time to time,
although I fear I can do nothing but alleviate,--a thousand little
circumstances will have occurred to awaken his alarm, to deepen it--so
that he will be all the better prepared.--Nay, my dear young lady--nay,
my dear--I saw Mr. Thornton, and I honour your father for the sacrifice
he has made, however mistaken I may believe him to be.--Well, this once,
if it will please you, my dear. Only remember, when I come again, I come
as a friend. And you must learn to look upon me as such, because seeing
each other--getting to know each other at such times as these, is worth
years of morning calls.' Margaret could not speak for crying: but she
wrung his hand at parting.

'That's what I call a fine girl!' thought Dr. Donaldson, when he was
seated in his carriage, and had time to examine his ringed hand, which
had slightly suffered from her pressure. 'Who would have thought that
little hand could have given such a squeeze? But the bones were well put
together, and that gives immense power. What a queen she is! With her
head thrown back at first, to force me into speaking the truth; and then
bent so eagerly forward to listen. Poor thing! I must see she does not
overstrain herself. Though it's astonishing how much those thorough-bred
creatures can do and suffer. That girl's game to the back-bone. Another,
who had gone that deadly colour, could never have come round without
either fainting or hysterics. But she wouldn't do either--not she! And
the very force of her will brought her round. Such a girl as that would
win my heart, if I were thirty years younger. It's too late now. Ah!
here we are at the Archers'.' So out he jumped, with thought, wisdom,
experience, sympathy, and ready to attend to the calls made upon them by
this family, just as if there were none other in the world.

Meanwhile, Margaret had returned into her father's study for a moment,
to recover strength before going upstairs into her mother's presence.

'Oh, my God, my God! but this is terrible. How shall I bear it? Such a
deadly disease! no hope! Oh, mamma, mamma, I wish I had never gone to
aunt Shaw's, and been all those precious years away from you! Poor
mamma! how much she must have borne! Oh, I pray thee, my God, that her
sufferings may not be too acute, too dreadful. How shall I bear to see
them? How can I bear papa's agony? He must not be told yet; not all at
once. It would kill him. But I won't lose another moment of my own dear,
precious mother.'

She ran upstairs. Dixon was not in the room. Mrs. Hale lay back in an
easy chair, with a soft white shawl wrapped around her, and a becoming
cap put on, in expectation of the doctor's visit. Her face had a little
faint colour in it, and the very exhaustion after the examination gave
it a peaceful look. Margaret was surprised to see her look so calm.

'Why, Margaret, how strange you look! What is the matter?' And then, as
the idea stole into her mind of what was indeed the real state of the
case, she added, as if a little displeased: 'you have not been seeing
Dr. Donaldson, and asking him any questions--have you, child?' Margaret
did not reply--only looked wistfully towards her. Mrs. Hale became more
displeased. 'He would not, surely, break his word to me, and'--

'Oh yes, mamma, he did. I made him. It was I--blame me.' She knelt down
by her mother's side, and caught her hand--she would not let it go,
though Mrs. Hale tried to pull it away. She kept kissing it, and the hot
tears she shed bathed it.

'Margaret, it was very wrong of you. You knew I did not wish you to
know.' But, as if tired with the contest, she left her hand in
Margaret's clasp, and by-and-by she returned the pressure faintly. That
encouraged Margaret to speak.

'Oh, mamma! let me be your nurse. I will learn anything Dixon can teach
me. But you know I am your child, and I do think I have a right to do
everything for you.'

'You don't know what you are asking,' said Mrs. Hale, with a shudder.

'Yes, I do. I know a great deal more than you are aware of. Let me be
your nurse. Let me try, at any rate. No one has ever, shall ever try so
hard as I will do. It will be such a comfort, mamma.'

'My poor child! Well, you shall try. Do you know, Margaret, Dixon and I
thought you would quite shrink from me if you knew--'

'Dixon thought!' said Margaret, her lip curling. 'Dixon could not give
me credit for enough true love--for as much as herself! She thought, I
suppose, that I was one of those poor sickly women who like to lie on
rose leaves, and be fanned all day. Don't let Dixon's fancies come any
more between you and me, mamma. Don't, please!' implored she.

'Don't be angry with Dixon,' said Mrs. Hale, anxiously. Margaret
recovered herself.

'No! I won't. I will try and be humble, and learn her ways, if you will
only let me do all I can for you. Let me be in the first place,
mother--I am greedy of that. I used to fancy you would forget me while I
was away at aunt Shaw's, and cry myself to sleep at nights with that
notion in my head.'

'And I used to think, how will Margaret bear our makeshift poverty after
the thorough comfort and luxury in Harley Street, till I have many a
time been more ashamed of your seeing our contrivances at Helstone than
of any stranger finding them out.'

'Oh, mamma! and I did so enjoy them. They were so much more amusing than
all the jog-trot Harley Street ways. The wardrobe shelf with handles,
that served as a supper-tray on grand occasions! And the old tea-chests
stuffed and covered for ottomans! I think what you call the makeshift
contrivances at dear Helstone were a charming part of the life there.'

'I shall never see Helstone again, Margaret,' said Mrs. Hale, the tears
welling up into her eyes. Margaret could not reply. Mrs. Hale went on.
'While I was there, I was for ever wanting to leave it. Every place
seemed pleasanter. And now I shall die far away from it. I am rightly
punished.'

'You must not talk so,' said Margaret, impatiently. 'He said you might
live for years. Oh, mother! we will have you back at Helstone yet.'

'No never! That I must take as a just penance. But,
Margaret--Frederick!' At the mention of that one word, she suddenly
cried out loud, as in some sharp agony. It seemed as if the thought of
him upset all her composure, destroyed the calm, overcame the
exhaustion. Wild passionate cry succeeded to cry--'Frederick! Frederick!
Come to me. I am dying. Little first-born child, come to me once again!'

She was in violent hysterics. Margaret went and called Dixon in terror.
Dixon came in a huff, and accused Margaret of having over-excited her
mother. Margaret bore all meekly, only trusting that her father might
not return. In spite of her alarm, which was even greater than the
occasion warranted, she obeyed all Dixon's directions promptly and well,
without a word of self-justification. By so doing she mollified her
accuser. They put her mother to bed, and Margaret sate by her till she
fell asleep, and afterwards till Dixon beckoned her out of the room,
and, with a sour face, as if doing something against the grain, she bade
her drink a cup of coffee which she had prepared for her in the
drawing-room, and stood over her in a commanding attitude as she did so.

'You shouldn't have been so curious, Miss, and then you wouldn't have
needed to fret before your time. It would have come soon enough. And
now, I suppose, you'll tell master, and a pretty household I shall have
of you!'

'No, Dixon,' said Margaret, sorrowfully, 'I will not tell papa. He could
not bear it as I can.' And by way of proving how well she bore it, she
burst into tears.

'Ay! I knew how it would be. Now you'll waken your mamma, just after
she's gone to sleep so quietly. Miss Margaret my dear, I've had to keep
it down this many a week; and though I don't pretend I can love her as
you do, yet I loved her better than any other man, woman, or child--no
one but Master Frederick ever came near her in my mind. Ever since Lady
Beresford's maid first took me in to see her dressed out in white crape,
and corn-ears, and scarlet poppies, and I ran a needle down into my
finger, and broke it in, and she tore up her worked pocket-handkerchief,
after they'd cut it out, and came in to wet the bandages again with
lotion when she returned from the ball--where she'd been the prettiest
young lady of all--I've never loved any one like her. I little thought
then that I should live to see her brought so low. I don't mean no
reproach to nobody. Many a one calls you pretty and handsome, and what
not. Even in this smoky place, enough to blind one's eyes, the owls can
see that. But you'll never be like your mother for beauty--never; not if
you live to be a hundred.'

'Mamma is very pretty still. Poor mamma!'

'Now don't ye set off again, or I shall give way at last' (whimpering).
'You'll never stand master's coming home, and questioning, at this rate.
Go out and take a walk, and come in something like. Many's the time I've
longed to walk it off--the thought of what was the matter with her, and
how it must all end.'

'Oh, Dixon!' said Margaret, 'how often I've been cross with you, not
knowing what a terrible secret you had to bear!'

'Bless you, child! I like to see you showing a bit of a spirit. It's the
good old Beresford blood. Why, the last Sir John but two shot his
steward down, there where he stood, for just telling him that he'd
racked the tenants, and he'd racked the tenants till he could get no
more money off them than he could get skin off a flint.'

'Well, Dixon, I won't shoot you, and I'll try not to be cross again.'

'You never have. If I've said it at times, it has always been to myself,
just in private, by way of making a little agreeable conversation, for
there's no one here fit to talk to. And when you fire up, you're the
very image of Master Frederick. I could find in my heart to put you in a
passion any day, just to see his stormy look coming like a great cloud
over your face. But now you go out, Miss. I'll watch over missus; and as
for master, his books are company enough for him, if he should come in.'

'I will go,' said Margaret. She hung about Dixon for a minute or so, as
if afraid and irresolute; then suddenly kissing her, she went quickly
out of the room.

'Bless her!' said Dixon. 'She's as sweet as a nut. There are three
people I love: it's missus, Master Frederick, and her. Just them three.
That's all. The rest be hanged, for I don't know what they're in the
world for. Master was born, I suppose, for to marry missus. If I thought
he loved her properly, I might get to love him in time. But he should
ha' made a deal more on her, and not been always reading, reading,
thinking, thinking. See what it has brought him to! Many a one who never
reads nor thinks either, gets to be Rector, and Dean, and what not; and
I dare say master might, if he'd just minded missus, and let the weary
reading and thinking alone.--There she goes' (looking out of the window
as she heard the front door shut). 'Poor young lady! her clothes look
shabby to what they did when she came to Helstone a year ago. Then she
hadn't so much as a darned stocking or a cleaned pair of gloves in all
her wardrobe. And now--!'




CHAPTER XVII

WHAT IS A STRIKE?

    'There are briars besetting every path,
     Which call for patient care;
     There is a cross in every lot,
     And an earnest need for prayer.'
             ANON.


Margaret went out heavily and unwillingly enough. But the length of a
street--yes, the air of a Milton Street--cheered her young blood before
she reached her first turning. Her step grew lighter, her lip redder.
She began to take notice, instead of having her thoughts turned so
exclusively inward. She saw unusual loiterers in the streets: men with
their hands in their pockets sauntering along; loud-laughing and
loud-spoken girls clustered together, apparently excited to high
spirits, and a boisterous independence of temper and behaviour. The more
ill-looking of the men--the discreditable minority--hung about on the
steps of the beer-houses and gin-shops, smoking, and commenting pretty
freely on every passer-by. Margaret disliked the prospect of the long
walk through these streets, before she came to the fields which she had
planned to reach. Instead, she would go and see Bessy Higgins. It would
not be so refreshing as a quiet country walk, but still it would perhaps
be doing the kinder thing.

Nicholas Higgins was sitting by the fire smoking, as she went in. Bessy
was rocking herself on the other side.

Nicholas took the pipe out of his mouth, and standing up, pushed his
chair towards Margaret; he leant against the chimney piece in a lounging
attitude, while she asked Bessy how she was.

'Hoo's rather down i' th' mouth in regard to spirits, but hoo's better
in health. Hoo doesn't like this strike. Hoo's a deal too much set on
peace and quietness at any price.'

'This is th' third strike I've seen,' said she, sighing, as if that was
answer and explanation enough.

'Well, third time pays for all. See if we don't dang th' masters this
time. See if they don't come, and beg us to come back at our own price.
That's all. We've missed it afore time, I grant yo'; but this time we'n
laid our plans desperate deep.'

'Why do you strike?' asked Margaret. 'Striking is leaving off work till
you get your own rate of wages, is it not? You must not wonder at my
ignorance; where I come from I never heard of a strike.'

'I wish I were there,' said Bessy, wearily. 'But it's not for me to get
sick and tired o' strikes. This is the last I'll see. Before it's ended
I shall be in the Great City--the Holy Jerusalem.'

'Hoo's so full of th' life to come, hoo cannot think of th' present. Now
I, yo' see, am bound to do the best I can here. I think a bird i' th'
hand is worth two i' th' bush. So them's the different views we take on
th' strike question.'

'But,' said Margaret, 'if the people struck, as you call it, where I
come from, as they are mostly all field labourers, the seed would not be
sown, the hay got in, the corn reaped.'

'Well?' said he. He had resumed his pipe, and put his 'well' in the form
of an interrogation.

'Why,' she went on, 'what would become of the farmers.'

He puffed away. 'I reckon they'd have either to give up their farms, or
to give fair rate of wage.'

'Suppose they could not, or would not do the last; they could not give
up their farms all in a minute, however much they might wish to do so;
but they would have no hay, nor corn to sell that year; and where would
the money come from to pay the labourers' wages the next?'

Still puffing away. At last he said:

'I know nought of your ways down South. I have heerd they're a pack of
spiritless, down-trodden men; welly clemmed to death; too much dazed wi'
clemming to know when they're put upon. Now, it's not so here. We known
when we're put upon; and we'en too much blood in us to stand it. We just
take our hands fro' our looms, and say, "Yo' may clem us, but yo'll not
put upon us, my masters!" And be danged to 'em, they shan't this time!'

'I wish I lived down South,' said Bessy.

'There's a deal to bear there,' said Margaret. 'There are sorrows to
bear everywhere. There is very hard bodily labour to be gone through,
with very little food to give strength.'

'But it's out of doors,' said Bessy. 'And away from the endless, endless
noise, and sickening heat.'

'It's sometimes in heavy rain, and sometimes in bitter cold. A young
person can stand it; but an old man gets racked with rheumatism, and
bent and withered before his time; yet he must just work on the same, or
else go to the workhouse.'

'I thought yo' were so taken wi' the ways of the South country.'

'So I am,' said Margaret, smiling a little, as she found herself thus
caught. 'I only mean, Bessy, there's good and bad in everything in this
world; and as you felt the bad up here, I thought it was but fair you
should know the bad down there.'

'And yo' say they never strike down there?' asked Nicholas, abruptly.

'No!' said Margaret; 'I think they have too much sense.'

'An' I think,' replied he, dashing the ashes out of his pipe with so
much vehemence that it broke, 'it's not that they've too much sense, but
that they've too little spirit.'

'O, father!' said Bessy, 'what have ye gained by striking? Think of that
first strike when mother died--how we all had to clem--you the worst of
all; and yet many a one went in every week at the same wage, till all
were gone in that there was work for; and some went beggars all their
lives at after.'

'Ay,' said he. 'That there strike was badly managed. Folk got into th'
management of it, as were either fools or not true men. Yo'll see, it'll
be different this time.'

'But all this time you've not told me what you're striking for,' said
Margaret, again.

'Why, yo' see, there's five or six masters who have set themselves again
paying the wages they've been paying these two years past, and
flourishing upon, and getting richer upon. And now they come to us, and
say we're to take less. And we won't. We'll just clem them to death
first; and see who'll work for 'em then. They'll have killed the goose
that laid 'em the golden eggs, I reckon.'

'And so you plan dying, in order to be revenged upon them!'

'No,' said he, 'I dunnot. I just look forward to the chance of dying at
my post sooner than yield. That's what folk call fine and honourable in
a soldier, and why not in a poor weaver-chap?'

'But,' said Margaret, 'a soldier dies in the cause of the Nation--in the
cause of others.'

He laughed grimly. 'My lass,' said he, 'yo're but a young wench, but
don't yo' think I can keep three people--that's Bessy, and Mary, and
me--on sixteen shilling a week? Dun yo' think it's for mysel' I'm
striking work at this time? It's just as much in the cause of others as
yon soldier--only m'appen, the cause he dies for is just that of
somebody he never clapt eyes on, nor heerd on all his born days, while I
take up John Boucher's cause, as lives next door but one, wi' a sickly
wife, and eight childer, none on 'em factory age; and I don't take up
his cause only, though he's a poor good-for-nought, as can only manage
two looms at a time, but I take up th' cause o' justice. Why are we to
have less wage now, I ask, than two year ago?'

'Don't ask me,' said Margaret; 'I am very ignorant. Ask some of your
masters. Surely they will give you a reason for it. It is not merely an
arbitrary decision of theirs, come to without reason.'

'Yo're just a foreigner, and nothing more,' said he, contemptuously.
'Much yo' know about it. Ask th' masters! They'd tell us to mind our own
business, and they'd mind theirs. Our business being, yo' understand, to
take the bated' wage, and be thankful, and their business to bate us
down to clemming point, to swell their profits. That's what it is.'

'But said Margaret, determined not to give way, although she saw she was
irritating him, 'the state of trade may be such as not to enable them to
give you the same remuneration.

'State o' trade! That's just a piece o' masters' humbug. It's rate o'
wages I was talking of. Th' masters keep th' state o' trade in their own
hands; and just walk it forward like a black bug-a-boo, to frighten
naughty children with into being good. I'll tell yo' it's their
part,--their cue, as some folks call it,--to beat us down, to swell
their fortunes; and it's ours to stand up and fight hard,--not for
ourselves alone, but for them round about us--for justice and fair play.
We help to make their profits, and we ought to help spend 'em. It's not
that we want their brass so much this time, as we've done many a time
afore. We'n getten money laid by; and we're resolved to stand and fall
together; not a man on us will go in for less wage than th' Union says
is our due. So I say, "hooray for the strike," and let Thornton, and
Slickson, and Hamper, and their set look to it!'

'Thornton!' said Margaret. 'Mr. Thornton of Marlborough Street?'

'Aye! Thornton o' Marlborough Mill, as we call him.'

'He is one of the masters you are striving with, is he not? What sort of
a master is he?'

'Did yo' ever see a bulldog? Set a bulldog on hind legs, and dress him
up in coat and breeches, and yo'n just getten John Thornton.'

'Nay,' said Margaret, laughing, 'I deny that. Mr. Thornton is plain
enough, but he's not like a bulldog, with its short broad nose, and
snarling upper lip.'

'No! not in look, I grant yo'. But let John Thornton get hold on a
notion, and he'll stick to it like a bulldog; yo' might pull him away
wi' a pitch-fork ere he'd leave go. He's worth fighting wi', is John
Thornton. As for Slickson, I take it, some o' these days he'll wheedle
his men back wi' fair promises; that they'll just get cheated out of as
soon as they're in his power again. He'll work his fines well out on
'em, I'll warrant. He's as slippery as an eel, he is. He's like a
cat,--as sleek, and cunning, and fierce. It'll never be an honest up and
down fight wi' him, as it will be wi' Thornton. Thornton's as dour as a
door-nail; an obstinate chap, every inch on him,--th' oud bulldog!'

'Poor Bessy!' said Margaret, turning round to her. 'You sigh over it
all. You don't like struggling and fighting as your father does, do
you?'

'No!' said she, heavily. 'I'm sick on it. I could have wished to have
had other talk about me in my latter days, than just the clashing and
clanging and clattering that has wearied a' my life long, about work and
wages, and masters, and hands, and knobsticks.'

'Poor wench! latter days be farred! Thou'rt looking a sight better
already for a little stir and change. Beside, I shall be a deal here to
make it more lively for thee.'

'Tobacco-smoke chokes me!' said she, querulously.

'Then I'll never smoke no more i' th' house!' he replied, tenderly. 'But
why didst thou not tell me afore, thou foolish wench?'

She did not speak for a while, and then so low that only Margaret heard
her:

'I reckon, he'll want a' the comfort he can get out o' either pipe or
drink afore he's done.'

Her father went out of doors, evidently to finish his pipe.

Bessy said passionately,

'Now am not I a fool,--am I not, Miss?--there, I knew I ought for to
keep father at home, and away fro' the folk that are always ready for to
tempt a man, in time o' strike, to go drink,--and there my tongue must
needs quarrel with this pipe o' his'n,--and he'll go off, I know he
will,--as often as he wants to smoke--and nobody knows where it'll end.
I wish I'd letten myself be choked first.'

'But does your father drink?' asked Margaret.

'No--not to say drink,' replied she, still in the same wild excited
tone. 'But what win ye have? There are days wi' you, as wi' other folk,
I suppose, when yo' get up and go through th' hours, just longing for a
bit of a change--a bit of a fillip, as it were. I know I ha' gone and
bought a four-pounder out o' another baker's shop to common on such
days, just because I sickened at the thought of going on for ever wi'
the same sight in my eyes, and the same sound in my ears, and the same
taste i' my mouth, and the same thought (or no thought, for that matter)
in my head, day after day, for ever. I've longed for to be a man to go
spreeing, even it were only a tramp to some new place in search o' work.
And father--all men--have it stronger in 'em than me to get tired o'
sameness and work for ever. And what is 'em to do? It's little blame to
them if they do go into th' gin-shop for to make their blood flow
quicker, and more lively, and see things they never see at no other
time--pictures, and looking-glass, and such like. But father never was a
drunkard, though maybe, he's got worse for drink, now and then. Only yo'
see,' and now her voice took a mournful, pleading tone, 'at times o'
strike there's much to knock a man down, for all they start so
hopefully; and where's the comfort to come fro'? He'll get angry and
mad--they all do--and then they get tired out wi' being angry and mad,
and maybe ha' done things in their passion they'd be glad to forget.
Bless yo'r sweet pitiful face! but yo' dunnot know what a strike is
yet.'

'Come, Bessy,' said Margaret, 'I won't say you're exaggerating, because
I don't know enough about it: but, perhaps, as you're not well, you're
only looking on one side, and there is another and a brighter to be
looked to.'

'It's all well enough for yo' to say so, who have lived in pleasant
green places all your life long, and never known want or care, or
wickedness either, for that matter.'

'Take care,' said Margaret, her cheek flushing, and her eye lightening,
'how you judge, Bessy. I shall go home to my mother, who is so ill--so
ill, Bessy, that there's no outlet but death for her out of the prison
of her great suffering; and yet I must speak cheerfully to my father,
who has no notion of her real state, and to whom the knowledge must come
gradually. The only person--the only one who could sympathise with me
and help me--whose presence could comfort my mother more than any other
earthly thing--is falsely accused--would run the risk of death if he
came to see his dying mother. This I tell you--only you, Bessy. You must
not mention it. No other person in Milton--hardly any other person in
England knows. Have I not care? Do I not know anxiety, though I go about
well-dressed, and have food enough? Oh, Bessy, God is just, and our lots
are well portioned out by Him, although none but He knows the bitterness
of our souls.'

'I ask your pardon,' replied Bessy, humbly. 'Sometimes, when I've
thought o' my life, and the little pleasure I've had in it, I've
believed that, maybe, I was one of those doomed to die by the falling of
a star from heaven; "And the name of the star is called Wormwood;" and
the third part of the waters became wormwood; and men died of the
waters, because they were made bitter." One can bear pain and sorrow
better if one thinks it has been prophesied long before for one:
somehow, then it seems as if my pain was needed for the fulfilment;
otherways it seems all sent for nothing.'

'Nay, Bessy--think!' said Margaret. 'God does not willingly afflict.
Don't dwell so much on the prophecies, but read the clearer parts of the
Bible.'

'I dare say it would be wiser; but where would I hear such grand words
of promise--hear tell o' anything so far different fro' this dreary
world, and this town above a', as in Revelations? Many's the time I've
repeated the verses in the seventh chapter to myself, just for the
sound. It's as good as an organ, and as different from every day, too.
No, I cannot give up Revelations. It gives me more comfort than any
other book i' the Bible.'

'Let me come and read you some of my favourite chapters.'

'Ay,' said she, greedily, 'come. Father will maybe hear yo'. He's deaved
wi' my talking; he says it's all nought to do with the things o' to-day,
and that's his business.'

'Where is your sister?'

'Gone fustian-cutting. I were loth to let her go; but somehow we must
live; and th' Union can't afford us much.'

'Now I must go. You have done me good, Bessy.'

'I done you good!'

'Yes. I came here very sad, and rather too apt to think my own cause for
grief was the only one in the world. And now I hear how you have had to
bear for years, and that makes me stronger.'

'Bless yo'! I thought a' the good-doing was on the side of gentle folk.
I shall get proud if I think I can do good to yo'.'

'You won't do it if you think about it. But you'll only puzzle yourself
if you do, that's one comfort.'

'Yo're not like no one I ever seed. I dunno what to make of yo'.'

'Nor I of myself. Good-bye!'

Bessy stilled her rocking to gaze after her.

'I wonder if there are many folk like her down South. She's like a
breath of country air, somehow. She freshens me up above a bit. Who'd
ha' thought that face--as bright and as strong as the angel I dream
of--could have known the sorrow she speaks on? I wonder how she'll sin.
All on us must sin. I think a deal on her, for sure. But father does the
like, I see. And Mary even. It's not often hoo's stirred up to notice
much.'




CHAPTER XVIII

LIKES AND DISLIKES

    'My heart revolts within me, and two voices
     Make themselves audible within my bosom.'
             WALLENSTEIN.


On Margaret's return home she found two letters on the table: one was a
note for her mother,--the other, which had come by the post, was
evidently from her Aunt Shaw--covered with foreign post-marks--thin,
silvery, and rustling. She took up the other, and was examining it, when
her father came in suddenly:

'So your mother is tired, and gone to bed early! I'm afraid, such a
thundery day was not the best in the world for the doctor to see her.
What did he say? Dixon tells me he spoke to you about her.'

Margaret hesitated. Her father's looks became more grave and anxious:

'He does not think her seriously ill?'

'Not at present; she needs care, he says; he was very kind, and said he
would call again, and see how his medicines worked.'

'Only care--he did not recommend change of air?--he did not say this
smoky town was doing her any harm, did he, Margaret?'

'No! not a word,' she replied, gravely. 'He was anxious, I think.'

'Doctors have that anxious manner; it's professional,' said he.

Margaret saw, in her father's nervous ways, that the first impression of
possible danger was made upon his mind, in spite of all his making light
of what she told him. He could not forget the subject,--could not pass
from it to other things; he kept recurring to it through the evening,
with an unwillingness to receive even the slightest unfavourable idea,
which made Margaret inexpressibly sad.

'This letter is from Aunt Shaw, papa. She has got to Naples, and finds
it too hot, so she has taken apartments at Sorrento. But I don't think
she likes Italy.'

'He did not say anything about diet, did he?'

'It was to be nourishing, and digestible. Mamma's appetite is pretty
good, I think.'

'Yes! and that makes it all the more strange he should have thought of
speaking about diet.'

'I asked him, papa.' Another pause. Then Margaret went on: 'Aunt Shaw
says, she has sent me some coral ornaments, papa; but,' added Margaret,
half smiling, 'she's afraid the Milton Dissenters won't appreciate them.
She has got all her ideas of Dissenters from the Quakers, has not she?'

'If ever you hear or notice that your mother wishes for anything, be
sure you let me know. I am so afraid she does not tell me always what
she would like. Pray, see after that girl Mrs. Thornton named. If we had
a good, efficient house-servant, Dixon could be constantly with her, and
I'd answer for it we'd soon set her up amongst us, if care will do it.
She's been very much tired of late, with the hot weather, and the
difficulty of getting a servant. A little rest will put her quite to
rights--eh, Margaret?'

'I hope so,' said Margaret,--but so sadly, that her father took notice
of it. He pinched her cheek.

'Come; if you look so pale as this, I must rouge you up a little. Take
care of yourself, child, or you'll be wanting the doctor next.'

But he could not settle to anything that evening. He was continually
going backwards and forwards, on laborious tiptoe, to see if his wife
was still asleep. Margaret's heart ached at his restlessness--his trying
to stifle and strangle the hideous fear that was looming out of the dark
places of his heart. He came back at last, somewhat comforted.

'She's awake now, Margaret. She quite smiled as she saw me standing by
her. Just her old smile. And she says she feels refreshed, and ready for
tea. Where's the note for her? She wants to see it. I'll read it to her
while you make tea.'

The note proved to be a formal invitation from Mrs. Thornton, to Mr.,
Mrs., and Miss Hale to dinner, on the twenty-first instant. Margaret was
surprised to find an acceptance contemplated, after all she had learnt
of sad probabilities during the day. But so it was. The idea of her
husband's and daughter's going to this dinner had quite captivated Mrs.
Hale's fancy, even before Margaret had heard the contents of the note.
It was an event to diversify the monotony of the invalid's life; and she
clung to the idea of their going, with even fretful pertinacity when
Margaret objected.

'Nay, Margaret? if she wishes it, I'm sure we'll both go willingly. She
never would wish it unless she felt herself really stronger--really
better than we thought she was, eh, Margaret?' said Mr. Hale, anxiously,
as she prepared to write the note of acceptance, the next day.

'Eh! Margaret?' questioned he, with a nervous motion of his hands. It
seemed cruel to refuse him the comfort he craved for. And besides, his
passionate refusal to admit the existence of fear, almost inspired
Margaret herself with hope.

'I do think she is better since last night,' said she. 'Her eyes look
brighter, and her complexion clearer.'

'God bless you,' said her father, earnestly. 'But is it true? Yesterday
was so sultry every one felt ill. It was a most unlucky day for Mr.
Donaldson to see her on.'

So he went away to his day's duties, now increased by the preparation of
some lectures he had promised to deliver to the working people at a
neighbouring Lyceum. He had chosen Ecclesiastical Architecture as his
subject, rather more in accordance with his own taste and knowledge than
as falling in with the character of the place or the desire for
particular kinds of information among those to whom he was to lecture.
And the institution itself, being in debt, was only too glad to get a
gratis course from an educated and accomplished man like Mr. Hale, let
the subject be what it might.

'Well, mother,' asked Mr. Thornton that night, 'who have accepted your
invitations for the twenty-first?'

'Fanny, where are the notes? The Slicksons accept, Collingbrooks accept,
Stephenses accept, Browns decline. Hales--father and daughter
come,--mother too great an invalid--Macphersons come, and Mr. Horsfall,
and Mr. Young. I was thinking of asking the Porters, as the Browns can't
come.'

'Very good. Do you know, I'm really afraid Mrs. Hale is very far from
well, from what Dr. Donaldson says.'

'It's strange of them to accept a dinner-invitation if she's very ill,'
said Fanny.

'I didn't say very ill,' said her brother, rather sharply. 'I only said
very far from well. They may not know it either.' And then he suddenly
remembered that, from what Dr. Donaldson had told him, Margaret, at any
rate, must be aware of the exact state of the case.

'Very probably they are quite aware of what you said yesterday, John--of
the great advantage it would be to them--to Mr. Hale, I mean, to be
introduced to such people as the Stephenses and the Collingbrooks.'

'I'm sure that motive would not influence them. No! I think I understand
how it is.'

'John!' said Fanny, laughing in her little, weak, nervous way. 'How you
profess to understand these Hales, and how you never will allow that we
can know anything about them. Are they really so very different to most
people one meets with?'

She did not mean to vex him; but if she had intended it, she could not
have done it more thoroughly. He chafed in silence, however, not
deigning to reply to her question.

'They do not seem to me out of the common way,' said Mrs. Thornton. 'He
appears a worthy kind of man enough; rather too simple for trade--so
it's perhaps as well he should have been a clergyman first, and now a
teacher. She's a bit of a fine lady, with her invalidism; and as for the
girl--she's the only one who puzzles me when I think about her,--which I
don't often do. She seems to have a great notion of giving herself airs;
and I can't make out why. I could almost fancy she thinks herself too
good for her company at times. And yet they're not rich, from all I can
hear they never have been.'

'And she's not accomplished, mamma. She can't play.'

'Go on, Fanny. What else does she want to bring her up to your
standard?'

'Nay! John,' said his mother, 'that speech of Fanny's did no harm. I
myself heard Miss Hale say she could not play. If you would let us
alone, we could perhaps like her, and see her merits.'

'I'm sure I never could!' murmured Fanny, protected by her mother. Mr.
Thornton heard, but did not care to reply. He was walking up and down
the dining-room, wishing that his mother would order candles, and allow
him to set to work at either reading or writing, and so put a stop to
the conversation. But he never thought of interfering in any of the
small domestic regulations that Mrs. Thornton observed, in habitual
remembrance of her old economies.

'Mother,' said he, stopping, and bravely speaking out the truth, 'I wish
you would like Miss Hale.'

'Why?' asked she, startled by his earnest, yet tender manner. 'You're
never thinking of marrying her?--a girl without a penny.'

'She would never have me,' said he, with a short laugh.

'No, I don't think she would,' answered his mother. 'She laughed in my
face, when I praised her for speaking out something Mr. Bell had said in
your favour. I liked the girl for doing it so frankly, for it made me
sure she had no thought of you; and the next minute she vexed me so by
seeming to think---- Well, never mind! Only you're right in saying she's
too good an opinion of herself to think of you. The saucy jade! I should
like to know where she'd find a better!' If these words hurt her son,
the dusky light prevented him from betraying any emotion. In a minute he
came up quite cheerfully to his mother, and putting one hand lightly on
her shoulder, said:

'Well, as I'm just as much convinced of the truth of what you have been
saying as you can be; and as I have no thought or expectation of ever
asking her to be my wife, you'll believe me for the future that I'm
quite disinterested in speaking about her. I foresee trouble for that
girl--perhaps want of motherly care--and I only wish you to be ready to
be a friend to her, in case she needs one. Now, Fanny,' said he, 'I
trust you have delicacy enough to understand, that it is as great an
injury to Miss Hale as to me--in fact, she would think it a greater--to
suppose that I have any reason, more than I now give, for begging you
and my mother to show her every kindly attention.'

'I cannot forgive her her pride,' said his mother; 'I will befriend her,
if there is need, for your asking, John. I would befriend Jezebel
herself if you asked me. But this girl, who turns up her nose at us
all--who turns up her nose at you---- '

'Nay, mother; I have never yet put myself, and I mean never to put
myself, within reach of her contempt.'

'Contempt, indeed!'--(One of Mrs. Thornton's expressive snorts.)--'Don't
go on speaking of Miss Hale, John, if I've to be kind to her. When I'm
with her, I don't know if I like or dislike her most; but when I think
of her, and hear you talk of her, I hate her. I can see she's given
herself airs to you as well as if you'd told me out.'

'And if she has,' said he--and then he paused for a moment--then went
on: 'I'm not a lad, to be cowed by a proud look from a woman, or to care
for her misunderstanding me and my position. I can laugh at it!'

'To be sure! and at her too, with her fine notions and haughty tosses!'

'I only wonder why you talk so much about her, then,' said Fanny. 'I'm
sure, I'm tired enough of the subject.'

'Well!' said her brother, with a shade of bitterness. 'Suppose we find
some more agreeable subject. What do you say to a strike, by way of
something pleasant to talk about?'

'Have the hands actually turned out?' asked Mrs. Thornton, with vivid
interest.

'Hamper's men are actually out. Mine are working out their week, through
fear of being prosecuted for breach of contract. I'd have had every one
of them up and punished for it, that left his work before his time was
out.'

'The law expenses would have been more than the hands them selves were
worth--a set of ungrateful naughts!' said his mother.

'To be sure. But I'd have shown them how I keep my word, and how I mean
them to keep theirs. They know me by this time. Slickson's men are
off--pretty certain he won't spend money in getting them punished. We're
in for a turn-out, mother.'

'I hope there are not many orders in hand?'

'Of course there are. They know that well enough. But they don't quite
understand all, though they think they do.'

'What do you mean, John?'

Candles had been brought, and Fanny had taken up her interminable piece
of worsted-work, over which she was yawning; throwing herself back in
her chair, from time to time, to gaze at vacancy, and think of nothing
at her ease.

'Why,' said he, 'the Americans are getting their yarns so into the
general market, that our only chance is producing them at a lower rate.
If we can't, we may shut up shop at once, and hands and masters go alike
on tramp. Yet these fools go back to the prices paid three years
ago--nay, some of their leaders quote Dickinson's prices now--though
they know as well as we do that, what with fines pressed out of their
wages as no honourable man would extort them, and other ways which I for
one would scorn to use, the real rate of wage paid at Dickinson's is
less than at ours. Upon my word, mother, I wish the old combination-laws
were in force. It is too bad to find out that fools--ignorant wayward
men like these--just by uniting their weak silly heads, are to rule over
the fortunes of those who bring all the wisdom that knowledge and
experience, and often painful thought and anxiety, can give. The next
thing will be--indeed, we're all but come to it now--that we shall have
to go and ask--stand hat in hand--and humbly ask the secretary of the
Spinner' Union to be so kind as to furnish us with labour at their own
price. That's what they want--they, who haven't the sense to see that,
if we don't get a fair share of the profits to compensate us for our
wear and tear here in England, we can move off to some other country;
and that, what with home and foreign competition, we are none of us
likely to make above a fair share, and may be thankful enough if we can
get that, in an average number of years.'

'Can't you get hands from Ireland? I wouldn't keep these fellows a day.
I'd teach them that I was master, and could employ what servants I
liked.'

'Yes! to be sure, I can; and I will, too, if they go on long. It will be
trouble and expense, and I fear there will be some danger; but I will do
it, rather than give in.'

'If there is to be all this extra expense, I'm sorry we're giving a
dinner just now.'

'So am I,--not because of the expense, but because I shall have much to
think about, and many unexpected calls on my time. But we must have had
Mr. Horsfall, and he does not stay in Milton long. And as for the
others, we owe them dinners, and it's all one trouble.'

He kept on with his restless walk--not speaking any more, but drawing a
deep breath from time to time, as if endeavouring to throw off some
annoying thought. Fanny asked her mother numerous small questions, all
having nothing to do with the subject, which a wiser person would have
perceived was occupying her attention. Consequently, she received many
short answers. She was not sorry when, at ten o'clock, the servants
filed in to prayers. These her mother always read,--first reading a
chapter. They were now working steadily through the Old Testament. When
prayers were ended, and his mother had wished him goodnight, with that
long steady look of hers which conveyed no expression of the tenderness
that was in her heart, but yet had the intensity of a blessing, Mr.
Thornton continued his walk. All his business plans had received a
check, a sudden pull-up, from this approaching turn-out. The forethought
of many anxious hours was thrown away, utterly wasted by their insane
folly, which would injure themselves even more than him, though no one
could set any limit to the mischief they were doing. And these were the
men who thought themselves fitted to direct the masters in the disposal
of their capital! Hamper had said, only this very day, that if he were
ruined by the strike, he would start life again, comforted by the
conviction that those who brought it on were in a worse predicament than
he himself,--for he had head as well as hands, while they had only
hands; and if they drove away their market, they could not follow it,
nor turn to anything else. But this thought was no consolation to Mr.
Thornton. It might be that revenge gave him no pleasure; it might be
that he valued the position he had earned with the sweat of his brow, so
much that he keenly felt its being endangered by the ignorance or folly
of others,--so keenly that he had no thoughts to spare for what would be
the consequences of their conduct to themselves. He paced up and down,
setting his teeth a little now and then. At last it struck two. The
candles were flickering in their sockets. He lighted his own, muttering
to himself:

'Once for all, they shall know whom they have got to deal with. I can
give them a fortnight,--no more. If they don't see their madness before
the end of that time, I must have hands from Ireland. I believe it's
Slickson's doing,--confound him and his dodges! He thought he was
overstocked; so he seemed to yield at first, when the deputation came to
him,--and of course, he only confirmed them in their folly, as he meant
to do. That's where it spread from.'




CHAPTER XIX

ANGEL VISITS

    'As angels in some brighter dreams
     Call to the soul when man doth sleep,
     So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes,
     And into glory peep.'
             HENRY VAUGHAN.


Mrs. Hale was curiously amused and interested by the idea of the
Thornton dinner party. She kept wondering about the details, with
something of the simplicity of a little child, who wants to have all its
anticipated pleasures described beforehand. But the monotonous life led
by invalids often makes them like children, inasmuch as they have
neither of them any sense of proportion in events, and seem each to
believe that the walls and curtains which shut in their world, and shut
out everything else, must of necessity be larger than anything hidden
beyond. Besides, Mrs. Hale had had her vanities as a girl; had perhaps
unduly felt their mortification when she became a poor clergyman's
wife;--they had been smothered and kept down; but they were not extinct;
and she liked to think of seeing Margaret dressed for a party, and
discussed what she should wear, with an unsettled anxiety that amused
Margaret, who had been more accustomed to society in her one in Harley
Street than her mother in five and twenty years of Helstone.

'Then you think you shall wear your white silk. Are you sure it will
fit? It's nearly a year since Edith was married!'

'Oh yes, mamma! Mrs. Murray made it, and it's sure to be right; it may
be a straw's breadth shorter or longer-waisted, according to my having
grown fat or thin. But I don't think I've altered in the least.'

'Hadn't you better let Dixon see it? It may have gone yellow with lying
by.'

'If you like, mamma. But if the worst comes to the worst, I've a very
nice pink gauze which aunt Shaw gave me, only two or three months before
Edith was married. That can't have gone yellow.'

'No! but it may have faded.'

'Well! then I've a green silk. I feel more as if it was the
embarrassment of riches.'

'I wish I knew what you ought to wear,' said Mrs. Hale, nervously.
Margaret's manner changed instantly. 'Shall I go and put them on one
after another, mamma, and then you could see which you liked best?'

'But--yes! perhaps that will be best.'

So off Margaret went. She was very much inclined to play some pranks
when she was dressed up at such an unusual hour; to make her rich white
silk balloon out into a cheese, to retreat backwards from her mother as
if she were the queen; but when she found that these freaks of hers were
regarded as interruptions to the serious business, and as such annoyed
her mother, she became grave and sedate. What had possessed the world
(her world) to fidget so about her dress, she could not understand; but
that very after noon, on naming her engagement to Bessy Higgins (apropos
of the servant that Mrs. Thornton had promised to inquire about), Bessy
quite roused up at the intelligence.

'Dear! and are you going to dine at Thornton's at Marlborough Mills?'

'Yes, Bessy. Why are you so surprised?'

'Oh, I dunno. But they visit wi' a' th' first folk in Milton.'

'And you don't think we're quite the first folk in Milton, eh, Bessy?'
Bessy's cheeks flushed a little at her thought being thus easily read.

'Well,' said she, 'yo' see, they thinken a deal o' money here and I
reckon yo've not getten much.'

'No,' said Margaret, 'that's very true. But we are educated people, and
have lived amongst educated people. Is there anything so wonderful, in
our being asked out to dinner by a man who owns himself inferior to my
father by coming to him to be instructed? I don't mean to blame Mr.
Thornton. Few drapers' assistants, as he was once, could have made
themselves what he is.'

'But can yo' give dinners back, in yo'r small house? Thornton's house is
three times as big.'

'Well, I think we could manage to give Mr. Thornton a dinner back, as
you call it. Perhaps not in such a large room, nor with so many people.
But I don't think we've thought about it at all in that way.'

'I never thought yo'd be dining with Thorntons,' repeated I Bessy. 'Why,
the mayor hissel' dines there; and the members of Parliament and all.'

'I think I could support the honour of meeting the mayor of Milton.

'But them ladies dress so grand!' said Bessy, with an anxious look at
Margaret's print gown, which her Milton eyes appraised at sevenpence a
yard. Margaret's face dimpled up into a merry laugh. 'Thank You, Bessy,
for thinking so kindly about my looking nice among all the smart people.
But I've plenty of grand gowns,--a week ago, I should have said they
were far too grand for anything I should ever want again. But as I'm to
dine at Mr. Thornton's, and perhaps to meet the mayor, I shall put on my
very best gown, you may be sure.'

'What win yo' wear?' asked Bessy, somewhat relieved.

'White silk,' said Margaret. 'A gown I had for a cousin's wedding, a
year ago.

'That'll do!' said Bessy, falling back in her chair. 'I should be loth
to have yo' looked down upon.

'Oh! I'll be fine enough, if that will save me from being looked down
upon in Milton.'

'I wish I could see you dressed up,' said Bessy. 'I reckon, yo're not
what folk would ca' pretty; yo've not red and white enough for that. But
dun yo' know, I ha' dreamt of yo', long afore ever I seed yo'.'

'Nonsense, Bessy!'

'Ay, but I did. Yo'r very face,--looking wi' yo'r clear steadfast eyes
out o' th' darkness, wi' yo'r hair blown off from yo'r brow, and going
out like rays round yo'r forehead, which was just as smooth and as
straight as it is now,--and yo' always came to give me strength, which I
seemed to gather out o' yo'r deep comforting eyes,--and yo' were drest
in shining raiment--just as yo'r going to be drest. So, yo' see, it was
yo'!'

'Nay, Bessy,' said Margaret, gently, 'it was but a dream.'

'And why might na I dream a dream in my affliction as well as others?
Did not many a one i' the Bible? Ay, and see visions too! Why, even my
father thinks a deal o' dreams! I tell yo' again, I saw yo' as plainly,
coming swiftly towards me, wi' yo'r hair blown back wi' the very
swiftness o' the motion, just like the way it grows, a little standing
off like; and the white shining dress on yo've getten to wear. Let me
come and see yo' in it. I want to see yo' and touch yo' as in very deed
yo' were in my dream.'

'My dear Bessy, it is quite a fancy of yours.'

'Fancy or no fancy,--yo've come, as I knew yo' would, when I saw yo'r
movement in my dream,--and when yo're here about me, I reckon I feel
easier in my mind, and comforted, just as a fire comforts one on a dree
day. Yo' said it were on th' twenty-first; please God, I'll come and see
yo'.'

'Oh Bessy! you may come and welcome; but don't talk so--it really makes
me sorry. It does indeed.'

'Then I'll keep it to mysel', if I bite my tongue out. Not but what it's
true for all that.'

Margaret was silent. At last she said,

'Let us talk about it sometimes, if you think it true. But not now. Tell
me, has your father turned out?'

'Ay!' said Bessy, heavily--in a manner very different from that she had
spoken in but a minute or two before. 'He and many another,--all
Hamper's men,--and many a one besides. Th' women are as bad as th' men,
in their savageness, this time. Food is high,--and they mun have food
for their childer, I reckon. Suppose Thorntons sent 'em their dinner
out,--th' same money, spent on potatoes and meal, would keep many a
crying babby quiet, and hush up its mother's heart for a bit!'

'Don't speak so!' said Margaret. 'You'll make me feel wicked and guilty
in going to this dinner.'

'No!' said Bessy. 'Some's pre-elected to sumptuous feasts, and purple
and fine linen,--may be yo're one on 'em. Others toil and moil all their
lives long--and the very dogs are not pitiful in our days, as they were
in the days of Lazarus. But if yo' ask me to cool yo'r tongue wi' th'
tip of my finger, I'll come across the great gulf to yo' just for th'
thought o' what yo've been to me here.'

'Bessy! you're very feverish! I can tell it in the touch of your hand,
as well as in what you're saying. It won't be division enough, in that
awful day, that some of us have been beggars here, and some of us have
been rich,--we shall not be judged by that poor accident, but by our
faithful following of Christ.' Margaret got up, and found some water and
soaking her pocket-handkerchief in it, she laid the cool wetness on
Bessy's forehead, and began to chafe the stone-cold feet. Bessy shut her
eyes, and allowed herself to be soothed. At last she said,

'Yo'd ha' been deaved out o' yo'r five wits, as well as me, if yo'd had
one body after another coming in to ask for father, and staying to tell
me each one their tale. Some spoke o' deadly hatred, and made my blood
run cold wi' the terrible things they said o' th' masters,--but more,
being women, kept plaining, plaining (wi' the tears running down their
cheeks, and never wiped away, nor heeded), of the price o' meat, and how
their childer could na sleep at nights for th' hunger.'

'And do they think the strike will mend this?' asked Margaret.

'They say so,' replied Bessy. 'They do say trade has been good for long,
and the masters has made no end o' money; how much father doesn't know,
but, in course, th' Union does; and, as is natural, they wanten their
share o' th' profits, now that food is getting dear; and th' Union says
they'll not be doing their duty if they don't make the masters give 'em
their share. But masters has getten th' upper hand somehow; and I'm
feared they'll keep it now and evermore. It's like th' great battle o'
Armageddon, the way they keep on, grinning and fighting at each other,
till even while they fight, they are picked off into the pit.' Just
then, Nicholas Higgins came in. He caught his daughter's last words.

'Ay! and I'll fight on too; and I'll get it this time. It'll not take
long for to make 'em give in, for they've getten a pretty lot of orders,
all under contract; and they'll soon find out they'd better give us our
five per cent than lose the profit they'll gain; let alone the fine for
not fulfilling the contract. Aha, my masters! I know who'll win.'

Margaret fancied from his manner that he must have been drinking, not so
much from what he said, as from the excited way in which he spoke; and
she was rather confirmed in this idea by the evident anxiety Bessy
showed to hasten her departure. Bessy said to her,--

'The twenty-first--that's Thursday week. I may come and see yo' dressed
for Thornton's, I reckon. What time is yo'r dinner?'

Before Margaret could answer, Higgins broke out,

'Thornton's! Ar' t' going to dine at Thornton's? Ask him to give yo' a
bumper to the success of his orders. By th' twenty-first, I reckon,
he'll be pottered in his brains how to get 'em done in time. Tell him,
there's seven hundred'll come marching into Marlborough Mills, the
morning after he gives the five per cent, and will help him through his
contract in no time. You'll have 'em all there. My master, Hamper. He's
one o' th' oud-fashioned sort. Ne'er meets a man bout an oath or a
curse; I should think he were going to die if he spoke me civil; but
arter all, his bark's waur than his bite, and yo' may tell him one o'
his turn-outs said so, if yo' like. Eh! but yo'll have a lot of prize
mill-owners at Thornton's! I should like to get speech o' them, when
they're a bit inclined to sit still after dinner, and could na run for
the life on 'em. I'd tell 'em my mind. I'd speak up again th' hard way
they're driving on us!'

'Good-bye!' said Margaret, hastily. 'Good-bye, Bessy! I shall look to
see you on the twenty-first, if you're well enough.'

The medicines and treatment which Dr. Donaldson had ordered for Mrs.
Hale, did her so much good at first that not only she herself, but
Margaret, began to hope that he might have been mistaken, and that she
could recover permanently. As for Mr. Hale, although he had never had an
idea of the serious nature of their apprehensions, he triumphed over
their fears with an evident relief, which proved how much his glimpse
into the nature of them had affected him. Only Dixon croaked for ever
into Margaret's ear. However, Margaret defied the raven, and would hope.

They needed this gleam of brightness in-doors, for out-of-doors, even to
their uninstructed eyes, there was a gloomy brooding appearance of
discontent. Mr. Hale had his own acquaintances among the working men,
and was depressed with their earnestly told tales of suffering and
long-endurance. They would have scorned to speak of what they had to
bear to any one who might, from his position, have understood it without
their words. But here was this man, from a distant county, who was
perplexed by the workings of the system into the midst of which he was
thrown, and each was eager to make him a judge, and to bring witness of
his own causes for irritation. Then Mr. Hale brought all his budget of
grievances, and laid it before Mr. Thornton, for him, with his
experience as a master, to arrange them, and explain their origin; which
he always did, on sound economical principles; showing that, as trade
was conducted, there must always be a waxing and waning of commercial
prosperity; and that in the waning a certain number of masters, as well
as of men, must go down into ruin, and be no more seen among the ranks
of the happy and prosperous. He spoke as if this consequence were so
entirely logical, that neither employers nor employed had any right to
complain if it became their fate: the employer to turn aside from the
race he could no longer run, with a bitter sense of incompetency and
failure--wounded in the struggle--trampled down by his fellows in their
haste to get rich--slighted where he once was honoured--humbly asking
for, instead of bestowing, employment with a lordly hand. Of course,
speaking so of the fate that, as a master, might be his own in the
fluctuations of commerce, he was not likely to have more sympathy with
that of the workmen, who were passed by in the swift merciless
improvement or alteration who would fain lie down and quietly die out of
the world that needed them not, but felt as if they could never rest in
their graves for the clinging cries of the beloved and helpless they
would leave behind; who envied the power of the wild bird, that can feed
her young with her very heart's blood. Margaret's whole soul rose up
against him while he reasoned in this way--as if commerce were
everything and humanity nothing. She could hardly, thank him for the
individual kindness, which brought him that very evening to offer
her--for the delicacy which made him understand that he must offer her
privately--every convenience for illness that his own wealth or his
mother's foresight had caused them to accumulate in their household, and
which, as he learnt from Dr. Donaldson, Mrs. Hale might possibly
require. His presence, after the way he had spoken--his bringing before
her the doom, which she was vainly trying to persuade herself might yet
be averted from her mother--all conspired to set Margaret's teeth on
edge, as she looked at him, and listened to him. What business had he to
be the only person, except Dr. Donaldson and Dixon, admitted to the
awful secret, which she held shut up in the most dark and sacred recess
of her heart--not daring to look at it, unless she invoked heavenly
strength to bear the sight--that, some day soon, she should cry aloud
for her mother, and no answer would come out of the blank, dumb
darkness? Yet he knew all. She saw it in his pitying eyes. She heard it
in his grave and tremulous voice. How reconcile those eyes, that voice,
with the hard-reasoning, dry, merciless way in which he laid down axioms
of trade, and serenely followed them out to their full consequences? The
discord jarred upon her inexpressibly. The more because of the gathering
woe of which she heard from Bessy. To be sure, Nicholas Higgins, the
father, spoke differently. He had been appointed a committee-man, and
said that he knew secrets of which the exoteric knew nothing. He said
this more expressly and particularly, on the very day before Mrs.
Thornton's dinner-party, when Margaret, going in to speak to Bessy,
found him arguing the point with Boucher, the neighbour of whom she had
frequently heard mention, as by turns exciting Higgins's compassion, as
an unskilful workman with a large family depending upon him for support,
and at other times enraging his more energetic and sanguine neighbour by
his want of what the latter called spirit. It was very evident that
Higgins was in a passion when Margaret entered. Boucher stood, with both
hands on the rather high mantel-piece, swaying himself a little on the
support which his arms, thus placed, gave him, and looking wildly into
the fire, with a kind of despair that irritated Higgins, even while it
went to his heart. Bessy was rocking herself violently backwards and
forwards, as was her wont (Margaret knew by this time) when she was
agitated. Her sister Mary was tying on her bonnet (in great clumsy bows,
as suited her great clumsy fingers), to go to her fustian-cutting,
blubbering out loud the while, and evidently longing to be away from a
scene that distressed her. Margaret came in upon this scene. She stood
for a moment at the door--then, her finger on her lips, she stole to a
seat on the squab near Bessy. Nicholas saw her come in, and greeted her
with a gruff, but not unfriendly nod. Mary hurried out of the house
catching gladly at the open door, and crying aloud when she got away
from her father's presence. It was only John Boucher that took no notice
whatever who came in and who went out.

'It's no use, Higgins. Hoo cannot live long a' this'n. Hoo's just
sinking away--not for want o' meat hersel'--but because hoo cannot stand
th' sight o' the little ones clemming. Ay, clemming! Five shilling a
week may do well enough for thee, wi' but two mouths to fill, and one on
'em a wench who can welly earn her own meat. But it's clemming to us.
An' I tell thee plain--if hoo dies as I'm 'feard hoo will afore we've
getten th' five per cent, I'll fling th' money back i' th' master's
face, and say, "Be domned to yo'; be domned to th' whole cruel world o'
yo'; that could na leave me th' best wife that ever bore childer to a
man!" An' look thee, lad, I'll hate thee, and th' whole pack o' th'
Union. Ay, an' chase yo' through heaven wi' my hatred,--I will, lad! I
will,--if yo're leading me astray i' this matter. Thou saidst, Nicholas,
on Wednesday sennight--and it's now Tuesday i' th' second week--that
afore a fortnight we'd ha' the masters coming a-begging to us to take
back our' work, at our own wage--and time's nearly up,--and there's our
lile Jack lying a-bed, too weak to cry, but just every now and then
sobbing up his heart for want o' food,--our lile Jack, I tell thee, lad!
Hoo's never looked up sin' he were born, and hoo loves him as if he were
her very life,--as he is,--for I reckon he'll ha' cost me that precious
price,--our lile Jack, who wakened me each morn wi' putting his sweet
little lips to my great rough fou' face, a-seeking a smooth place to
kiss,--an' he lies clemming.' Here the deep sobs choked the poor man,
and Nicholas looked up, with eyes brimful of tears, to Margaret, before
he could gain courage to speak.

'Hou'd up, man. Thy lile Jack shall na' clem. I ha' getten brass, and
we'll go buy the chap a sup o' milk an' a good four-pounder this very
minute. What's mine's thine, sure enough, i' thou'st i' want. Only,
dunnot lose heart, man!' continued he, as he fumbled in a tea-pot for
what money he had. 'I lay yo' my heart and soul we'll win for a' this:
it's but bearing on one more week, and yo just see th' way th' masters
'll come round, praying on us to come back to our mills. An' th'
Union,--that's to say, I--will take care yo've enough for th' childer
and th' missus. So dunnot turn faint-heart, and go to th' tyrants
a-seeking work.'

The man turned round at these words,--turned round a face so white, and
gaunt, and tear-furrowed, and hopeless, that its very calm forced
Margaret to weep. 'Yo' know well, that a worser tyrant than e'er th'
masters were says "Clem to death, and see 'em a' clem to death, ere yo'
dare go again th' Union." Yo' know it well, Nicholas, for a' yo're one
on 'em. Yo' may be kind hearts, each separate; but once banded together,
yo've no more pity for a man than a wild hunger-maddened wolf.'

Nicholas had his hand on the lock of the door--he stopped and turned
round on Boucher, close following:

'So help me God! man alive--if I think not I'm doing best for thee, and
for all on us. If I'm going wrong when I think I'm going right, it's
their sin, who ha' left me where I am, in my ignorance. I ha' thought
till my brains ached,--Beli' me, John, I have. An' I say again, there's
no help for us but having faith i' th' Union. They'll win the day, see
if they dunnot!'

Not one word had Margaret or Bessy spoken. They had hardly uttered the
sighing, that the eyes of each called to the other to bring up from the
depths of her heart. At last Bessy said,

'I never thought to hear father call on God again. But yo' heard him
say, "So help me God!"'

'Yes!' said Margaret. 'Let me bring you what money I can spare,--let me
bring you a little food for that poor man's children. Don't let them
know it comes from any one but your father. It will be but little.'

Bessy lay back without taking any notice of what Margaret said. She did
not cry--she only quivered up her breath,

'My heart's drained dry o' tears,' she said. 'Boucher's been in these
days past, a telling me of his fears and his troubles. He's but a weak
kind o' chap, I know, but he's a man for a' that; and tho' I've been
angry, many a time afore now, wi' him an' his wife, as knew no more nor
him how to manage, yet, yo' see, all folks isn't wise, yet God lets 'em
live--ay, an' gives 'em some one to love, and be loved by, just as good
as Solomon. An', if sorrow comes to them they love, it hurts 'em as sore
as e'er it did Solomon. I can't make it out. Perhaps it's as well such a
one as Boucher has th' Union to see after him. But I'd just like for to
see th' mean as make th' Union, and put 'em one by one face to face wi'
Boucher. I reckon, if they heard him, they'd tell him (if I cotched 'em
one by one), he might go back and get what he could for his work, even
if it weren't so much as they ordered.'

Margaret sat utterly silent. How was she ever to go away into comfort
and forget that man's voice, with the tone of unutterable agony, telling
more by far than his words of what he had to suffer? She took out her
purse; she had not much in it of what she could call her own, but what
she had she put into Bessy's hand without speaking.

'Thank yo'. There's many on 'em gets no more, and is not so bad
off,--leastways does not show it as he does. But father won't let 'em
want, now he knows. Yo' see, Boucher's been pulled down wi' his
childer,--and her being so cranky, and a' they could pawn has gone this
last twelvemonth. Yo're not to think we'd ha' letten 'em clem, for all
we're a bit pressed oursel'; if neighbours doesn't see after neighbours,
I dunno who will.' Bessy seemed almost afraid lest Margaret should think
they had not the will, and, to a certain degree, the power of helping
one whom she evidently regarded as having a claim upon them. 'Besides,'
she went on, 'father is sure and positive the masters must give in
within these next few days,--that they canna hould on much longer. But I
thank yo' all the same,--I thank yo' for mysel', as much as for Boucher,
for it just makes my heart warm to yo' more and more.'

Bessy seemed much quieter to-day, but fearfully languid and exhausted.
As she finished speaking, she looked so faint and weary that Margaret
became alarmed.

'It's nout,' said Bessy. 'It's not death yet. I had a fearfu' night wi'
dreams--or somewhat like dreams, for I were wide awake--and I'm all in a
swounding daze to-day,--only yon poor chap made me alive again. No! it's
not death yet, but death is not far off. Ay! Cover me up, and I'll may
be sleep, if th' cough will let me. Good night--good afternoon, m'appen
I should say--but th' light is dim an' misty to-day.'




CHAPTER XX

MEN AND GENTLEMEN

    'Old and young, boy, let 'em all eat, I have it;
     Let 'em have ten tire of teeth a-piece, I care not.'
             ROLLO, DUKE OF NORMANDY.


Margaret went home so painfully occupied with what she had heard and
seen that she hardly knew how to rouse herself up to the duties which
awaited her; the necessity for keeping up a constant flow of cheerful
conversation for her mother, who, now that she was unable to go out,
always looked to Margaret's return from the shortest walk as bringing in
some news.

'And can your factory friend come on Thursday to see you dressed?'

'She was so ill I never thought of asking her,' said Margaret,
dolefully.

'Dear! Everybody is ill now, I think,' said Mrs. Hale, with a little of
the jealousy which one invalid is apt to feel of another. 'But it must
be very sad to be ill in one of those little back streets.' (Her kindly
nature prevailing, and the old Helstone habits of thought returning.)
'It's bad enough here. What could you do for her, Margaret? Mr. Thornton
has sent me some of his old port wine since you went out. Would a bottle
of that do her good, think you?'

'No, mamma! I don't believe they are very poor,--at least, they don't
speak as if they were; and, at any rate, Bessy's illness is
consumption--she won't want wine. Perhaps, I might take her a little
preserve, made of our dear Helstone fruit. No! there's another family to
whom I should like to give--Oh mamma, mamma! how am I to dress up in my
finery, and go off and away to smart parties, after the sorrow I have
seen to-day?' exclaimed Margaret, bursting the bounds she had
preordained for herself before she came in, and telling her mother of
what she had seen and heard at Higgins's cottage.

It distressed Mrs. Hale excessively. It made her restlessly irritated
till she could do something. She directed Margaret to pack up a basket
in the very drawing-room, to be sent there and then to the family; and
was almost angry with her for saying, that it would not signify if it
did not go till morning, as she knew Higgins had provided for their
immediate wants, and she herself had left money with Bessy. Mrs. Hale
called her unfeeling for saying this; and never gave herself
breathing-time till the basket was sent out of the house. Then she said:

'After all, we may have been doing wrong. It was only the last time Mr.
Thornton was here that he said, those were no true friends who helped to
prolong the struggle by assisting the turn outs. And this Boucher-man
was a turn-out, was he not?'

The question was referred to Mr. Hale by his wife, when he came
up-stairs, fresh from giving a lesson to Mr. Thornton, which had ended
in conversation, as was their wont. Margaret did not care if their gifts
had prolonged the strike; she did not think far enough for that, in her
present excited state.

Mr. Hale listened, and tried to be as calm as a judge; he recalled all
that had seemed so clear not half-an-hour before, as it came out of Mr.
Thornton's lips; and then he made an unsatisfactory compromise. His wife
and daughter had not only done quite right in this instance, but he did
not see for a moment how they could have done otherwise. Nevertheless,
as a general rule, it was very true what Mr. Thornton said, that as the
strike, if prolonged, must end in the masters' bringing hands from a
distance (if, indeed, the final result were not, as it had often been
before, the invention of some machine which would diminish the need of
hands at all), why, it was clear enough that the kindest thing was to
refuse all help which might bolster them up in their folly. But, as to
this Boucher, he would go and see him the first thing in the morning,
and try and find out what could be done for him.

Mr. Hale went the next morning, as he proposed. He did not find Boucher
at home, but he had a long talk with his wife; promised to ask for an
Infirmary order for her; and, seeing the plenty provided by Mrs. Hale,
and somewhat lavishly used by the children, who were masters down-stairs
in their father's absence, he came back with a more consoling and
cheerful account than Margaret had dared to hope for; indeed, what she
had said the night before had prepared her father for so much worse a
state of things that, by a reaction of his imagination, he described all
as better than it really was.

'But I will go again, and see the man himself,' said Mr. Hale. 'I hardly
know as yet how to compare one of these houses with our Helstone
cottages. I see furniture here which our labourers would never have
thought of buying, and food commonly used which they would consider
luxuries; yet for these very families there seems no other resource, now
that their weekly wages are stopped, but the pawn-shop. One had need to
learn a different language, and measure by a different standard, up here
in Milton.'

Bessy, too, was rather better this day. Still she was so weak that she
seemed to have entirely forgotten her wish to see Margaret dressed--if,
indeed, that had not been the feverish desire of a half-delirious state.

Margaret could not help comparing this strange dressing of hers, to go
where she did not care to be--her heart heavy with various
anxieties--with the old, merry, girlish toilettes that she and Edith had
performed scarcely more than a year ago. Her only pleasure now in
decking herself out was in thinking that her mother would take delight
in seeing her dressed. She blushed when Dixon, throwing the drawing-room
door open, made an appeal for admiration.

'Miss Hale looks well, ma'am,--doesn't she? Mrs. Shaw's coral couldn't
have come in better. It just gives the right touch of colour, ma'am.
Otherwise, Miss Margaret, you would have been too pale.'

Margaret's black hair was too thick to be plaited; it needed rather to
be twisted round and round, and have its fine silkiness compressed into
massive coils, that encircled her head like a crown, and then were
gathered into a large spiral knot behind. She kept its weight together
by two large coral pins, like small arrows for length. Her white silk
sleeves were looped up with strings of the same material, and on her
neck, just below the base of her curved and milk-white throat, there lay
heavy coral beads.

'Oh, Margaret! how I should like to be going with you to one of the old
Barrington assemblies,--taking you as Lady Beresford used to take me.'
Margaret kissed her mother for this little burst of maternal vanity; but
she could hardly smile at it, she felt so much out of spirits.

'I would rather stay at home with you,--much rather, mamma.'

'Nonsense, darling! Be sure you notice the dinner well. I shall like to
hear how they manage these things in Milton. Particularly the second
course, dear. Look what they have instead of game.'

Mrs. Hale would have been more than interested,--she would have been
astonished, if she had seen the sumptuousness of the dinner-table and
its appointments. Margaret, with her London cultivated taste, felt the
number of delicacies to be oppressive; one half of the quantity would
have been enough, and the effect lighter and more elegant. But it was
one of Mrs. Thornton's rigorous laws of hospitality, that of each
separate dainty enough should be provided for all the guests to partake,
if they felt inclined. Careless to abstemiousness in her daily habits,
it was part of her pride to set a feast before such of her guests as
cared for it. Her son shared this feeling. He had never known--though he
might have imagined, and had the capability to relish--any kind of
society but that which depended on an exchange of superb meals and even
now, though he was denying himself the personal expenditure of an
unnecessary sixpence, and had more than once regretted that the
invitations for this dinner had been sent out, still, as it was to be,
he was glad to see the old magnificence of preparation.

Margaret and her father were the first to arrive. Mr. Hale was anxiously
punctual to the time specified. There was no one up-stairs in the
drawing-room but Mrs. Thornton and Fanny. Every cover was taken off,
and the apartment blazed forth in yellow silk damask and a
brilliantly-flowered carpet. Every corner seemed filled up with ornament,
until it became a weariness to the eye, and presented a strange contrast
to the bald ugliness of the look-out into the great mill-yard, where wide
folding gates were thrown open for the admission of carriages. The mill
loomed high on the left-hand side of the windows, casting a shadow down
from its many stories, which darkened the summer evening before its time.

'My son was engaged up to the last moment on business. He will be here
directly, Mr. Hale. May I beg you to take a seat?'

Mr. Hale was standing at one of the windows as Mrs. Thornton spoke. He
turned away, saying,

'Don't you find such close neighbourhood to the mill rather unpleasant
at times?'

She drew herself up:

'Never. I am not become so fine as to desire to forget the source of my
son's wealth and power. Besides, there is not such another factory in
Milton. One room alone is two hundred and twenty square yards.'

'I meant that the smoke and the noise--the constant going out and coming
in of the work-people, might be annoying!'

'I agree with you, Mr. Hale!' said Fanny. 'There is a continual smell of
steam, and oily machinery--and the noise is perfectly deafening.'

'I have heard noise that was called music far more deafening. The
engine-room is at the street-end of the factory; we hardly hear it,
except in summer weather, when all the windows are open; and as for the
continual murmur of the work-people, it disturbs me no more than the
humming of a hive of bees. If I think of it at all, I connect it with my
son, and feel how all belongs to him, and that his is the head that
directs it. Just now, there are no sounds to come from the mill; the
hands have been ungrateful enough to turn out, as perhaps you have
heard. But the very business (of which I spoke, when you entered), had
reference to the steps he is going to take to make them learn their
place.' The expression on her face, always stern, deepened into dark
anger, as she said this. Nor did it clear away when Mr. Thornton entered
the room; for she saw, in an instant, the weight of care and anxiety
which he could not shake off, although his guests received from him a
greeting that appeared both cheerful and cordial. He shook hands with
Margaret. He knew it was the first time their hands had met, though she
was perfectly unconscious of the fact. He inquired after Mrs. Hale, and
heard Mr. Hale's sanguine, hopeful account; and glancing at Margaret, to
understand how far she agreed with her father, he saw that no dissenting
shadow crossed her face. And as he looked with this intention, he was
struck anew with her great beauty. He had never seen her in such dress
before and yet now it appeared as if such elegance of attire was so
befitting her noble figure and lofty serenity of countenance, that she
ought to go always thus apparelled. She was talking to Fanny; about
what, he could not hear; but he saw his sister's restless way of
continually arranging some part of her gown, her wandering eyes, now
glancing here, now there, but without any purpose in her observation;
and he contrasted them uneasily with the large soft eyes that looked
forth steadily at one object, as if from out their light beamed some
gentle influence of repose: the curving lines of the red lips, just
parted in the interest of listening to what her companion said--the head
a little bent forwards, so as to make a long sweeping line from the
summit, where the light caught on the glossy raven hair, to the smooth
ivory tip of the shoulder; the round white arms, and taper hands, laid
lightly across each other, but perfectly motionless in their pretty
attitude. Mr. Thornton sighed as he took in all this with one of his
sudden comprehensive glances. And then he turned his back to the young
ladies, and threw himself, with an effort, but with all his heart and
soul, into a conversation with Mr. Hale.

More people came--more and more. Fanny left Margaret's side, and helped
her mother to receive her guests. Mr. Thornton felt that in this influx
no one was speaking to Margaret, and was restless under this apparent
neglect. But he never went near her himself; he did not look at her.
Only, he knew what she was doing--or not doing--better than he knew the
movements of any one else in the room. Margaret was so unconscious of
herself, and so much amused by watching other people, that she never
thought whether she was left unnoticed or not. Somebody took her down to
dinner; she did not catch the name; nor did he seem much inclined to
talk to her. There was a very animated conversation going on among the
gentlemen; the ladies, for the most part, were silent, employing
themselves in taking notes of the dinner and criticising each other's
dresses. Margaret caught the clue to the general conversation, grew
interested and listened attentively. Mr. Horsfall, the stranger, whose
visit to the town was the original germ of the party, was asking
questions relative to the trade and manufactures of the place; and the
rest of the gentlemen--all Milton men,--were giving him answers and
explanations. Some dispute arose, which was warmly contested; it was
referred to Mr. Thornton, who had hardly spoken before; but who now gave
an opinion, the grounds of which were so clearly stated that even the
opponents yielded. Margaret's attention was thus called to her host; his
whole manner as master of the house, and entertainer of his friends, was
so straightforward, yet simple and modest, as to be thoroughly
dignified. Margaret thought she had never seen him to so much advantage.
When he had come to their house, there had been always something, either
of over-eagerness or of that kind of vexed annoyance which seemed ready
to pre-suppose that he was unjustly judged, and yet felt too proud to
try and make himself better understood. But now, among his fellows,
there was no uncertainty as to his position. He was regarded by them as
a man of great force of character; of power in many ways. There was no
need to struggle for their respect. He had it, and he knew it; and the
security of this gave a fine grand quietness to his voice and ways,
which Margaret had missed before.

He was not in the habit of talking to ladies; and what he did say was a
little formal. To Margaret herself he hardly spoke at all. She was
surprised to think how much she enjoyed this dinner. She knew enough now
to understand many local interests--nay, even some of the technical
words employed by the eager mill-owners. She silently took a very
decided part in the question they were discussing. At any rate, they
talked in desperate earnest,--not in the used-up style that wearied her
so in the old London parties. She wondered that with all this dwelling
on the manufactures and trade of the place, no allusion was made to the
strike then pending. She did not yet know how coolly such things were
taken by the masters, as having only one possible end. To be sure, the
men were cutting their own throats, as they had done many a time before;
but if they would be fools, and put themselves into the hands of a
rascally set of paid delegates, they must take the consequence. One or
two thought Thornton looked out of spirits; and, of course, he must lose
by this turn-out. But it was an accident that might happen to themselves
any day; and Thornton was as good to manage a strike as any one; for he
was as iron a chap as any in Milton. The hands had mistaken their man in
trying that dodge on him. And they chuckled inwardly at the idea of the
workmen's discomfiture and defeat, in their attempt to alter one iota of
what Thornton had decreed. It was rather dull for Margaret after dinner.
She was glad when the gentlemen came, not merely because she caught her
father's eye to brighten her sleepiness up; but because she could listen
to something larger and grander than the petty interests which the
ladies had been talking about. She liked the exultation in the sense of
power which these Milton men had. It might be rather rampant in its
display, and savour of boasting; but still they seemed to defy the old
limits of possibility, in a kind of fine intoxication, caused by the
recollection of what had been achieved, and what yet should be. If in
her cooler moments she might not approve of their spirit in all things,
still there was much to admire in their forgetfulness of themselves and
the present, in their anticipated triumphs over all inanimate matter at
some future time which none of them should live to see. She was rather
startled when Mr. Thornton spoke to her, close at her elbow:

'I could see you were on our side in our discussion at dinner,--were you
not, Miss Hale?'

'Certainly. But then I know so little about it. I was surprised,
however, to find from what Mr. Horsfall said, that there were others who
thought in so diametrically opposite a manner, as the Mr. Morison he
spoke about. He cannot be a gentleman--is he?'

'I am not quite the person to decide on another's gentlemanliness, Miss
Hale. I mean, I don't quite understand your application of the word. But
I should say that this Morison is no true man. I don't know who he is; I
merely judge him from Mr. Horsfall's account.'

'I suspect my "gentleman" includes your "true man."'

'And a great deal more, you would imply. I differ from you. A man is to
me a higher and a completer being than a gentleman.'

'What do you mean?' asked Margaret. 'We must understand the words
differently.'

'I take it that "gentleman" is a term that only describes a person in
his relation to others; but when we speak of him as "a man," we consider
him not merely with regard to his fellow-men, but in relation to
himself,--to life--to time--to eternity. A cast-away lonely as Robinson
Crusoe--a prisoner immured in a dungeon for life--nay, even a saint in
Patmos, has his endurance, his strength, his faith, best described by
being spoken of as "a man." I am rather weary of this word
"gentlemanly," which seems to me to be often inappropriately used, and
often, too, with such exaggerated distortion of meaning, while the full
simplicity of the noun "man," and the adjective "manly" are
unacknowledged--that I am induced to class it with the cant of the day.'

Margaret thought a moment,--but before she could speak her slow
conviction, he was called away by some of the eager manufacturers, whose
speeches she could not hear, though she could guess at their import by
the short clear answers Mr. Thornton gave, which came steady and firm as
the boom of a distant minute gun. They were evidently talking of the
turn-out, and suggesting what course had best be pursued. She heard Mr.
Thornton say:

'That has been done.' Then came a hurried murmur, in which two or three
joined.

'All those arrangements have been made.'

Some doubts were implied, some difficulties named by Mr. Slickson, who
took hold of Mr. Thornton's arm, the better to impress his words. Mr.
Thornton moved slightly away, lifted his eyebrows a very little, and
then replied:

'I take the risk. You need not join in it unless you choose.' Still some
more fears were urged.

'I'm not afraid of anything so dastardly as incendiarism. We are open
enemies; and I can protect myself from any violence that I apprehend.
And I will assuredly protect all others who come to me for work. They
know my determination by this time, as well and as fully as you do.'

Mr. Horsfall took him a little on one side, as Margaret conjectured, to
ask him some other question about the strike; but, in truth, it was to
inquire who she herself was--so quiet, so stately, and so beautiful.

'A Milton lady?' asked he, as the name was given.

'No! from the south of England--Hampshire, I believe,' was the cold,
indifferent answer.

Mrs. Slickson was catechising Fanny on the same subject.

'Who is that fine distinguished-looking girl? a sister of Mr.
Horsfall's?'

'Oh dear, no! That is Mr. Hale, her father, talking now to Mr. Stephens.
He gives lessons; that is to say, he reads with young men. My brother
John goes to him twice a week, and so he begged mamma to ask them here,
in hopes of getting him known. I believe, we have some of their
prospectuses, if you would like to have one.'

'Mr. Thornton! Does he really find time to read with a tutor, in the
midst of all his business,--and this abominable strike in hand as well?'

Fanny was not sure, from Mrs. Slickson's manner, whether she ought to be
proud or ashamed of her brother's conduct; and, like all people who try
and take other people's 'ought' for the rule of their feelings, she was
inclined to blush for any singularity of action. Her shame was
interrupted by the dispersion of the guests.




CHAPTER XXI

THE DARK NIGHT

    'On earth is known to none
     The smile that is not sister to a tear.'
             ELLIOTT.


Margaret and her father walked home. The night was fine, the streets
clean, and with her pretty white silk, like Leezie Lindsay's gown o'
green satin, in the ballad, 'kilted up to her knee,' she was off with
her father--ready to dance along with the excitement of the cool, fresh
night air.

'I rather think Thornton is not quite easy in his mind about this
strike. He seemed very anxious to-night.'

'I should wonder if he were not. But he spoke with his usual coolness to
the others, when they suggested different things, just before we came
away.'

'So he did after dinner as well. It would take a good deal to stir him
from his cool manner of speaking; but his face strikes me as anxious.'

'I should be, if I were he. He must know of the growing anger and hardly
smothered hatred of his workpeople, who all look upon him as what the
Bible calls a "hard man,"--not so much unjust as unfeeling; clear in
judgment, standing upon his "rights" as no human being ought to stand,
considering what we and all our petty rights are in the sight of the
Almighty. I am glad you think he looks anxious. When I remember
Boucher's half mad words and ways, I cannot bear to think how coolly Mr.
Thornton spoke.'

'In the first place, I am not so convinced as you are about that man
Boucher's utter distress; for the moment, he was badly off, I don't
doubt. But there is always a mysterious supply of money from these
Unions; and, from what you said, it was evident the man was of a
passionate, demonstrative nature, and gave strong expression to all he
felt.'

'Oh, papa!'

'Well! I only want you to do justice to Mr. Thornton, who is, I suspect,
of an exactly opposite nature,--a man who is far too proud to show his
feelings. Just the character I should have thought beforehand, you would
have admired, Margaret.'

'So I do,--so I should; but I don't feel quite so sure as you do of the
existence of those feelings. He is a man of great strength of
character,--of unusual intellect, considering the few advantages he has
had.'

'Not so few. He has led a practical life from a very early age; has been
called upon to exercise judgment and self-control. All that developes
one part of the intellect. To be sure, he needs some of the knowledge of
the past, which gives the truest basis for conjecture as to the future;
but he knows this need,--he perceives it, and that is something. You are
quite prejudiced against Mr. Thornton, Margaret.'

'He is the first specimen of a manufacturer--of a person engaged in
trade--that I had ever the opportunity of studying, papa. He is my first
olive: let me make a face while I swallow it. I know he is good of his
kind, and by and by I shall like the kind. I rather think I am already
beginning to do so. I was very much interested by what the gentlemen
were talking about, although I did not understand half of it. I was
quite sorry when Miss Thornton came to take me to the other end of the
room, saying she was sure I should be uncomfortable at being the only
lady among so many gentlemen. I had never thought about it, I was so
busy listening; and the ladies were so dull, papa--oh, so dull! Yet I
think it was clever too. It reminded me of our old game of having each
so many nouns to introduce into a sentence.'

'What do you mean, child?' asked Mr. Hale.

'Why, they took nouns that were signs of things which gave evidence of
wealth,--housekeepers, under-gardeners, extent of glass, valuable lace,
diamonds, and all such things; and each one formed her speech so as to
bring them all in, in the prettiest accidental manner possible.'

'You will be as proud of your one servant when you get her, if all is
true about her that Mrs. Thornton says.'

'To be sure, I shall. I felt like a great hypocrite to-night, sitting
there in my white silk gown, with my idle hands before me, when I
remembered all the good, thorough, house-work they had done to-day. They
took me for a fine lady, I'm sure.'

'Even I was mistaken enough to think you looked like a lady my dear,'
said Mr. Hale, quietly smiling.

But smiles were changed to white and trembling looks, when they saw
Dixon's face, as she opened the door.

'Oh, master!--Oh, Miss Margaret! Thank God you are come! Dr. Donaldson
is here. The servant next door went for him, for the charwoman is gone
home. She's better now; but, oh, sir! I thought she'd have died an hour
ago.'

Mr. Hale caught Margaret's arm to steady himself from falling. He looked
at her face, and saw an expression upon it of surprise and extremest
sorrow, but not the agony of terror that contracted his own unprepared
heart. She knew more than he did, and yet she listened with that
hopeless expression of awed apprehension.

'Oh! I should not have left her--wicked daughter that I am!' moaned
forth Margaret, as she supported her trembling father's hasty steps
up-stairs. Dr. Donaldson met them on the landing.

'She is better now,' he whispered. 'The opiate has taken effect. The
spasms were very bad: no wonder they frightened your maid; but she'll
rally this time.'

'This time! Let me go to her!' Half an hour ago, Mr. Hale was a
middle-aged man; now his sight was dim, his senses wavering, his walk
tottering, as if he were seventy years of age.

Dr. Donaldson took his arm, and led him into the bedroom. Margaret
followed close. There lay her mother, with an unmistakable look on her
face. She might be better now; she was sleeping, but Death had signed
her for his own, and it was clear that ere long he would return to take
possession. Mr. Hale looked at her for some time without a word. Then he
began to shake all over, and, turning away from Dr. Donaldson's anxious
care, he groped to find the door; he could not see it, although several
candles, brought in the sudden affright, were burning and flaring there.
He staggered into the drawing-room, and felt about for a chair. Dr.
Donaldson wheeled one to him, and placed him in it. He felt his pulse.

'Speak to him, Miss Hale. We must rouse him.'

'Papa!' said Margaret, with a crying voice that was wild with pain.
'Papa! Speak to me!' The speculation came again into his eyes, and he
made a great effort.

'Margaret, did you know of this? Oh, it was cruel of you!'

'No, sir, it was not cruel!' replied Dr. Donaldson, with quick decision.
'Miss Hale acted under my directions. There may have been a mistake, but
it was not cruel. Your wife will be a different creature to-morrow, I
trust. She has had spasms, as I anticipated, though I did not tell Miss
Hale of my apprehensions. She has taken the opiate I brought with me;
she will have a good long sleep; and to-morrow, that look which has
alarmed you so much will have passed away.'

'But not the disease?'

Dr. Donaldson glanced at Margaret. Her bent head, her face raised with
no appeal for a temporary reprieve, showed that quick observer of human
nature that she thought it better that the whole truth should be told.

'Not the disease. We cannot touch the disease, with all our poor vaunted
skill. We can only delay its progress--alleviate the pain it causes. Be
a man, sir--a Christian. Have faith in the immortality of the soul,
which no pain, no mortal disease, can assail or touch!'

But all the reply he got, was in the choked words, 'You have never been
married, Dr. Donaldson; you do not know what it is,' and in the deep,
manly sobs, which went through the stillness of the night like heavy
pulses of agony. Margaret knelt by him, caressing him with tearful
caresses. No one, not even Dr. Donaldson, knew how the time went by. Mr.
Hale was the first to dare to speak of the necessities of the present
moment.

'What must we do?' asked he. 'Tell us both. Margaret is my staff--my
right hand.'

Dr. Donaldson gave his clear, sensible directions. No fear for
to-night--nay, even peace for to-morrow, and for many days yet. But no
enduring hope of recovery. He advised Mr. Hale to go to bed, and leave
only one to watch the slumber, which he hoped would be undisturbed. He
promised to come again early in the morning. And with a warm and kindly
shake of the hand, he left them. They spoke but few words; they were too
much exhausted by their terror to do more than decide upon the immediate
course of action. Mr. Hale was resolved to sit up through the night, and
all that Margaret could do was to prevail upon him to rest on the
drawing-room sofa. Dixon stoutly and bluntly refused to go to bed; and,
as for Margaret, it was simply impossible that she should leave her
mother, let all the doctors in the world speak of 'husbanding
resources,' and 'one watcher only being required.' So, Dixon sat, and
stared, and winked, and drooped, and picked herself up again with a
jerk, and finally gave up the battle, and fairly snored. Margaret had
taken off her gown and tossed it aside with a sort of impatient disgust,
and put on her dressing-gown. She felt as if she never could sleep
again; as if her whole senses were acutely vital, and all endued with
double keenness, for the purposes of watching. Every sight and
sound--nay, even every thought, touched some nerve to the very quick.
For more than two hours, she heard her father's restless movements in
the next room. He came perpetually to the door of her mother's chamber,
pausing there to listen, till she, not hearing his close unseen
presence, went and opened it to tell him how all went on, in reply to
the questions his baked lips could hardly form. At last he, too, fell
asleep, and all the house was still. Margaret sate behind the curtain
thinking. Far away in time, far away in space, seemed all the interests
of past days. Not more than thirty-six hours ago, she cared for Bessy
Higgins and her father, and her heart was wrung for Boucher; now, that
was all like a dreaming memory of some former life;--everything that had
passed out of doors seemed dissevered from her mother, and therefore
unreal. Even Harley Street appeared more distinct; there she remembered,
as if it were yesterday, how she had pleased herself with tracing out
her mother's features in her Aunt Shaw's face,--and how letters had
come, making her dwell on the thoughts of home with all the longing of
love. Helstone, itself, was in the dim past. The dull gray days of the
preceding winter and spring, so uneventless and monotonous, seemed more
associated with what she cared for now above all price. She would fain
have caught at the skirts of that departing time, and prayed it to
return, and give her back what she had too little valued while it was
yet in her possession. What a vain show Life seemed! How unsubstantial,
and flickering, and flitting! It was as if from some aerial belfry, high
up above the stir and jar of the earth, there was a bell continually
tolling, 'All are shadows!--all are passing!--all is past!' And when the
morning dawned, cool and gray, like many a happier morning before--when
Margaret looked one by one at the sleepers, it seemed as if the terrible
night were unreal as a dream; it, too, was a shadow. It, too, was past.

Mrs. Hale herself was not aware when she awoke, how ill she had been the
night before. She was rather surprised at Dr. Donaldson's early visit,
and perplexed by the anxious faces of husband and child. She consented
to remain in bed that day, saying she certainly was tired; but, the
next, she insisted on getting up; and Dr. Donaldson gave his consent to
her returning into the drawing-room. She was restless and uncomfortable
in every position, and before night she became very feverish. Mr. Hale
was utterly listless, and incapable of deciding on anything.

'What can we do to spare mamma such another night?' asked Margaret on
the third day.

'It is, to a certain degree, the reaction after the powerful opiates I
have been obliged to use. It is more painful for you to see than for her
to bear, I believe. But, I think, if we could get a water-bed it might
be a good thing. Not but what she will be better to-morrow; pretty much
like herself as she was before this attack. Still, I should like her to
have a water-bed. Mrs. Thornton has one, I know. I'll try and call there
this afternoon. Stay,' said he, his eye catching on Margaret's face,
blanched with watching in a sick room, 'I'm not sure whether I can go;
I've a long round to take. It would do you no harm to have a brisk walk
to Marlborough Street, and ask Mrs. Thornton if she can spare it.'

'Certainly,' said Margaret. 'I could go while mamma is asleep this
afternoon. I'm sure Mrs. Thornton would lend it to us.'

Dr. Donaldson's experience told them rightly. Mrs. Hale seemed to shake
off the consequences of her attack, and looked brighter and better this
afternoon than Margaret had ever hoped to see her again. Her daughter
left her after dinner, sitting in her easy chair, with her hand lying in
her husband's, who looked more worn and suffering than she by far.
Still, he could smile now--rather slowly, rather faintly, it is true;
but a day or two before, Margaret never thought to see him smile again.

It was about two miles from their house in Crampton Crescent to
Marlborough Street. It was too hot to walk very quickly. An August sun
beat straight down into the street at three o'clock in the afternoon.
Margaret went along, without noticing anything very different from usual
in the first mile and a half of her journey; she was absorbed in her own
thoughts, and had learnt by this time to thread her way through the
irregular stream of human beings that flowed through Milton streets.
But, by and by, she was struck with an unusual heaving among the mass of
people in the crowded road on which she was entering. They did not
appear to be moving on, so much as talking, and listening, and buzzing
with excitement, without much stirring from the spot where they might
happen to be. Still, as they made way for her, and, wrapt up in the
purpose of her errand, and the necessities that suggested it, she was
less quick of observation than she might have been, if her mind had been
at ease, she had got into Marlborough Street before the full conviction
forced itself upon her, that there was a restless, oppressive sense of
irritation abroad among the people; a thunderous atmosphere, morally as
well as physically, around her. From every narrow lane opening out on
Marlborough Street came up a low distant roar, as of myriads of fierce
indignant voices. The inhabitants of each poor squalid dwelling were
gathered round the doors and windows, if indeed they were not actually
standing in the middle of the narrow ways--all with looks intent towards
one point. Marlborough Street itself was the focus of all those human
eyes, that betrayed intensest interest of various kinds; some fierce
with anger, some lowering with relentless threats, some dilated with
fear, or imploring entreaty; and, as Margaret reached the small
side-entrance by the folding doors, in the great dead wall of
Marlborough mill-yard and waited the porter's answer to the bell, she
looked round and heard the first long far-off roll of the tempest;--saw
the first slow-surging wave of the dark crowd come, with its threatening
crest, tumble over, and retreat, at the far end of the street, which a
moment ago, seemed so full of repressed noise, but which now was
ominously still; all these circumstances forced themselves on Margaret's
notice, but did not sink down into her pre-occupied heart. She did not
know what they meant--what was their deep significance; while she did
know, did feel the keen sharp pressure of the knife that was soon to
stab her through and through by leaving her motherless. She was trying
to realise that, in order that, when it came, she might be ready to
comfort her father.

The porter opened the door cautiously, not nearly wide enough to admit
her.

'It's you, is it, ma'am?' said he, drawing a long breath, and widening
the entrance, but still not opening it fully. Margaret went in. He
hastily bolted it behind her.

'Th' folk are all coming up here I reckon?' asked he.

'I don't know. Something unusual seemed going on; but this street is
quite empty, I think.'

She went across the yard and up the steps to the house door. There was
no near sound,--no steam-engine at work with beat and pant,--no click of
machinery, or mingling and clashing of many sharp voices; but far away,
the ominous gathering roar, deep-clamouring.




CHAPTER XXII

A BLOW AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

    'But work grew scarce, while bread grew dear,
     And wages lessened, too;
     For Irish hordes were bidders here,
     Our half-paid work to do.'
             CORN LAW RHYMES.


Margaret was shown into the drawing-room. It had returned into its
normal state of bag and covering. The windows were half open because of
the heat, and the Venetian blinds covered the glass,--so that a gray
grim light, reflected from the pavement below, threw all the shadows
wrong, and combined with the green-tinged upper light to make even
Margaret's own face, as she caught it in the mirrors, look ghastly and
wan. She sat and waited; no one came. Every now and then, the wind
seemed to bear the distant multitudinous sound nearer; and yet there was
no wind! It died away into profound stillness between whiles.

Fanny came in at last.

'Mamma will come directly, Miss Hale. She desired me to apologise to you
as it is. Perhaps you know my brother has imported hands from Ireland,
and it has irritated the Milton people excessively--as if he hadn't a
right to get labour where he could; and the stupid wretches here
wouldn't work for him; and now they've frightened these poor Irish
starvelings so with their threats, that we daren't let them out. You may
see them huddled in that top room in the mill,--and they're to sleep
there, to keep them safe from those brutes, who will neither work nor
let them work. And mamma is seeing about their food, and John is
speaking to them, for some of the women are crying to go back. Ah!
here's mamma!'

Mrs. Thornton came in with a look of black sternness on her face, which
made Margaret feel she had arrived at a bad time to trouble her with her
request. However, it was only in compliance with Mrs. Thornton's
expressed desire, that she would ask for whatever they might want in the
progress of her mother's illness. Mrs. Thornton's brow contracted, and
her mouth grew set, while Margaret spoke with gentle modesty of her
mother's restlessness, and Dr. Donaldson's wish that she should have the
relief of a water-bed. She ceased. Mrs. Thornton did not reply
immediately. Then she started up and exclaimed--

'They're at the gates! Call John, Fanny,--call him in from the mill!
They're at the gates! They'll batter them in! Call John, I say!'

And simultaneously, the gathering tramp--to which she had been
listening, instead of heeding Margaret's words--was heard just right
outside the wall, and an increasing din of angry voices raged behind the
wooden barrier, which shook as if the unseen maddened crowd made
battering-rams of their bodies, and retreated a short space only to come
with more united steady impetus against it, till their great beats made
the strong gates quiver, like reeds before the wind. The women gathered
round the windows, fascinated to look on the scene which terrified them.
Mrs. Thornton, the women-servants, Margaret,--all were there. Fanny had
returned, screaming up-stairs as if pursued at every step, and had
thrown herself in hysterical sobbing on the sofa. Mrs. Thornton watched
for her son, who was still in the mill. He came out, looked up at
them--the pale cluster of faces--and smiled good courage to them, before
he locked the factory-door. Then he called to one of the women to come
down and undo his own door, which Fanny had fastened behind her in her
mad flight. Mrs. Thornton herself went. And the sound of his well-known
and commanding voice, seemed to have been like the taste of blood to the
infuriated multitude outside. Hitherto they had been voiceless,
wordless, needing all their breath for their hard-labouring efforts to
break down the gates. But now, hearing him speak inside, they set up
such a fierce unearthly groan, that even Mrs. Thornton was white with
fear as she preceded him into the room. He came in a little flushed, but
his eyes gleaming, as in answer to the trumpet-call of danger, and with
a proud look of defiance on his face, that made him a noble, if not a
handsome man. Margaret had always dreaded lest her courage should fail
her in any emergency, and she should be proved to be, what she dreaded
lest she was--a coward. But now, in this real great time of reasonable
fear and nearness of terror, she forgot herself, and felt only an
intense sympathy--intense to painfulness--in the interests of the
moment.

Mr. Thornton came frankly forwards:

'I'm sorry, Miss Hale, you have visited us at this unfortunate moment,
when, I fear, you may be involved in whatever risk we have to bear.
Mother! hadn't you better go into the back rooms? I'm not sure whether
they may not have made their way from Pinner's Lane into the
stable-yard; but if not, you will be safer there than here. Go Jane!'
continued he, addressing the upper-servant. And she went, followed by
the others.

'I stop here!' said his mother. 'Where you are, there I stay.' And
indeed, retreat into the back rooms was of no avail; the crowd had
surrounded the outbuildings at the rear, and were sending forth their
awful threatening roar behind. The servants retreated into the garrets,
with many a cry and shriek. Mr. Thornton smiled scornfully as he heard
them. He glanced at Margaret, standing all by herself at the window
nearest the factory. Her eyes glittered, her colour was deepened on
cheek and lip. As if she felt his look, she turned to him and asked a
question that had been for some time in her mind:

'Where are the poor imported work-people? In the factory there?'

'Yes! I left them cowered up in a small room, at the head of a back
flight of stairs; bidding them run all risks, and escape down there, if
they heard any attack made on the mill-doors. But it is not them--it is
me they want.'

'When can the soldiers be here?' asked his mother, in a low but not
unsteady voice.

He took out his watch with the same measured composure with which he did
everything. He made some little calculation:

'Supposing Williams got straight off when I told him, and hadn't to
dodge about amongst them--it must be twenty minutes yet.'

'Twenty minutes!' said his mother, for the first time showing her terror
in the tones of her voice.

'Shut down the windows instantly, mother,' exclaimed he: 'the gates
won't bear such another shock. Shut down that window, Miss Hale.'

Margaret shut down her window, and then went to assist Mrs. Thornton's
trembling fingers.

From some cause or other, there was a pause of several minutes in the
unseen street. Mrs. Thornton looked with wild anxiety at her son's
countenance, as if to gain the interpretation of the sudden stillness
from him. His face was set into rigid lines of contemptuous defiance;
neither hope nor fear could be read there.

Fanny raised herself up:

'Are they gone?' asked she, in a whisper.

'Gone!' replied he. 'Listen!'

She did listen; they all could hear the one great straining breath; the
creak of wood slowly yielding; the wrench of iron; the mighty fall of
the ponderous gates. Fanny stood up tottering--made a step or two
towards her mother, and fell forwards into her arms in a fainting fit.
Mrs. Thornton lifted her up with a strength that was as much that of the
will as of the body, and carried her away.

'Thank God!' said Mr. Thornton, as he watched her out. 'Had you not
better go upstairs, Miss Hale?'

Margaret's lips formed a 'No!'--but he could not hear her speak, for the
tramp of innumerable steps right under the very wall of the house, and
the fierce growl of low deep angry voices that had a ferocious murmur of
satisfaction in them, more dreadful than their baffled cries not many
minutes before.

'Never mind!' said he, thinking to encourage her. 'I am very sorry you
should have been entrapped into all this alarm; but it cannot last long
now; a few minutes more, and the soldiers will be here.'

'Oh, God!' cried Margaret, suddenly; 'there is Boucher. I know his face,
though he is livid with rage,--he is fighting to get to the front--look!
look!'

'Who is Boucher?' asked Mr. Thornton, coolly, and coming close to the
window to discover the man in whom Margaret took such an interest. As
soon as they saw Mr. Thornton, they set up a yell,--to call it not human
is nothing,--it was as the demoniac desire of some terrible wild beast
for the food that is withheld from his ravening. Even he drew back for a
moment, dismayed at the intensity of hatred he had provoked.

'Let them yell!' said he. 'In five minutes more--. I only hope my poor
Irishmen are not terrified out of their wits by such a fiendlike noise.
Keep up your courage for five minutes, Miss Hale.'

'Don't be afraid for me,' she said hastily. 'But what in five minutes?
Can you do nothing to soothe these poor creatures? It is awful to see
them.'

'The soldiers will be here directly, and that will bring them to
reason.'

'To reason!' said Margaret, quickly. 'What kind of reason?'

'The only reason that does with men that make themselves into wild
beasts. By heaven! they've turned to the mill-door!'

'Mr. Thornton,' said Margaret, shaking all over with her passion, 'go
down this instant, if you are not a coward. Go down and face them like a
man. Save these poor strangers, whom you have decoyed here. Speak to
your workmen as if they were human beings. Speak to them kindly. Don't
let the soldiers come in and cut down poor creatures who are driven mad.
I see one there who is. If you have any courage or noble quality in you,
go out and speak to them, man to man.'

He turned and looked at her while she spoke. A dark cloud came over his
face while he listened. He set his teeth as he heard her words.

'I will go. Perhaps I may ask you to accompany me downstairs, and bar
the door behind me; my mother and sister will need that protection.'

'Oh! Mr. Thornton! I do not know--I may be wrong--only--'

But he was gone; he was downstairs in the hall; he had unbarred the
front door; all she could do, was to follow him quickly, and fasten it
behind him, and clamber up the stairs again with a sick heart and a
dizzy head. Again she took her place by the farthest window. He was on
the steps below; she saw that by the direction of a thousand angry eyes;
but she could neither see nor hear anything save the savage satisfaction
of the rolling angry murmur. She threw the window wide open. Many in the
crowd were mere boys; cruel and thoughtless,--cruel because they were
thoughtless; some were men, gaunt as wolves, and mad for prey. She knew
how it was; they were like Boucher, with starving children at
home--relying on ultimate success in their efforts to get higher wages,
and enraged beyond measure at discovering that Irishmen were to be
brought in to rob their little ones of bread. Margaret knew it all; she
read it in Boucher's face, forlornly desperate and livid with rage. If
Mr. Thornton would but say something to them--let them hear his voice
only--it seemed as if it would be better than this wild beating and
raging against the stony silence that vouchsafed them no word, even of
anger or reproach. But perhaps he was speaking now; there was a
momentary hush of their noise, inarticulate as that of a troop of
animals. She tore her bonnet off; and bent forwards to hear. She could
only see; for if Mr. Thornton had indeed made the attempt to speak, the
momentary instinct to listen to him was past and gone, and the people
were raging worse than ever. He stood with his arms folded; still as a
statue; his face pale with repressed excitement. They were trying to
intimidate him--to make him flinch; each was urging the other on to some
immediate act of personal violence. Margaret felt intuitively, that in
an instant all would be uproar; the first touch would cause an
explosion, in which, among such hundreds of infuriated men and reckless
boys, even Mr. Thornton's life would be unsafe,--that in another instant
the stormy passions would have passed their bounds, and swept away all
barriers of reason, or apprehension of consequence. Even while she
looked, she saw lads in the back-ground stooping to take off their heavy
wooden clogs--the readiest missile they could find; she saw it was the
spark to the gunpowder, and, with a cry, which no one heard, she rushed
out of the room, down stairs,--she had lifted the great iron bar of the
door with an imperious force--had thrown the door open wide--and was
there, in face of that angry sea of men, her eyes smiting them with
flaming arrows of reproach. The clogs were arrested in the hands that
held them--the countenances, so fell not a moment before, now looked
irresolute, and as if asking what this meant. For she stood between them
and their enemy. She could not speak, but held out her arms towards them
till she could recover breath.

'Oh, do not use violence! He is one man, and you are many; but her words
died away, for there was no tone in her voice; it was but a hoarse
whisper. Mr. Thornton stood a little on one side; he had moved away from
behind her, as if jealous of anything that should come between him and
danger.

'Go!' said she, once more (and now her voice was like a cry). 'The
soldiers are sent for--are coming. Go peaceably. Go away. You shall have
relief from your complaints, whatever they are.'

'Shall them Irish blackguards be packed back again?' asked one from out
the crowd, with fierce threatening in his voice.

'Never, for your bidding!' exclaimed Mr. Thornton. And instantly the
storm broke. The hootings rose and filled the air,--but Margaret did not
hear them. Her eye was on the group of lads who had armed themselves
with their clogs some time before. She saw their gesture--she knew its
meaning,--she read their aim. Another moment, and Mr. Thornton might be
smitten down,--he whom she had urged and goaded to come to this perilous
place. She only thought how she could save him. She threw her arms
around him; she made her body into a shield from the fierce people
beyond. Still, with his arms folded, he shook her off.

'Go away,' said he, in his deep voice. 'This is no place for you.'

'It is!' said she. 'You did not see what I saw.' If she thought her sex
would be a protection,--if, with shrinking eyes she had turned away from
the terrible anger of these men, in any hope that ere she looked again
they would have paused and reflected, and slunk away, and vanished,--she
was wrong. Their reckless passion had carried them too far to stop--at
least had carried some of them too far; for it is always the savage
lads, with their love of cruel excitement, who head the riot--reckless
to what bloodshed it may lead. A clog whizzed through the air.
Margaret's fascinated eyes watched its progress; it missed its aim, and
she turned sick with affright, but changed not her position, only hid
her face on Mr. Thornton s arm. Then she turned and spoke again:'

'For God's sake! do not damage your cause by this violence. You do not
know what you are doing.' She strove to make her words distinct.

A sharp pebble flew by her, grazing forehead and cheek, and drawing a
blinding sheet of light before her eyes. She lay like one dead on Mr.
Thornton's shoulder. Then he unfolded his arms, and held her encircled
in one for an instant:

'You do well!' said he. 'You come to oust the innocent stranger. You
fall--you hundreds--on one man; and when a woman comes before you, to
ask you for your own sakes to be reasonable creatures, your cowardly
wrath falls upon her! You do well!' They were silent while he spoke.
They were watching, open-eyed and open-mouthed, the thread of dark-red
blood which wakened them up from their trance of passion. Those nearest
the gate stole out ashamed; there was a movement through all the
crowd--a retreating movement. Only one voice cried out:

'Th' stone were meant for thee; but thou wert sheltered behind a woman!'

Mr. Thornton quivered with rage. The blood-flowing had made Margaret
conscious--dimly, vaguely conscious. He placed her gently on the
door-step, her head leaning against the frame.

'Can you rest there?' he asked. But without waiting for her answer, he
went slowly down the steps right into the middle of the crowd. 'Now kill
me, if it is your brutal will. There is no woman to shield me here. You
may beat me to death--you will never move me from what I have determined
upon--not you!' He stood amongst them, with his arms folded, in
precisely the same attitude as he had been in on the steps.

But the retrograde movement towards the gate had begun--as
unreasoningly, perhaps as blindly, as the simultaneous anger. Or,
perhaps, the idea of the approach of the soldiers, and the sight of that
pale, upturned face, with closed eyes, still and sad as marble, though
the tears welled out of the long entanglement of eyelashes and dropped
down; and, heavier, slower plash than even tears, came the drip of blood
from her wound. Even the most desperate--Boucher himself--drew back,
faltered away, scowled, and finally went off, muttering curses on the
master, who stood in his unchanging attitude, looking after their
retreat with defiant eyes. The moment that retreat had changed into a
flight (as it was sure from its very character to do), he darted up the
steps to Margaret. She tried to rise without his help.

'It is nothing,' she said, with a sickly smile. 'The skin is grazed, and
I was stunned at the moment. Oh, I am so thankful they are gone!' And
she cried without restraint.

He could not sympathise with her. His anger had not abated; it was
rather rising the more as his sense of immediate danger was passing
away. The distant clank of the soldiers was heard just five minutes too
late to make this vanished mob feel the power of authority and order. He
hoped they would see the troops, and be quelled by the thought of their
narrow escape. While these thoughts crossed his mind, Margaret clung to
the doorpost to steady herself: but a film came over her eyes--he was
only just in time to catch her. 'Mother--mother!' cried he; 'Come
down--they are gone, and Miss Hale is hurt!' He bore her into the
dining-room, and laid her on the sofa there; laid her down softly, and
looking on her pure white face, the sense of what she was to him came
upon him so keenly that he spoke it out in his pain:

'Oh, my Margaret--my Margaret! no one can tell what you are to me!
Dead--cold as you lie there, you are the only woman I ever loved! Oh,
Margaret--Margaret!' Inarticulately as he spoke, kneeling by her, and
rather moaning than saying the words, he started up, ashamed of himself,
as his mother came in. She saw nothing, but her son a little paler, a
little sterner than usual.

'Miss Hale is hurt, mother. A stone has grazed her temple. She has lost
a good deal of blood, I'm afraid.'

'She looks very seriously hurt,--I could almost fancy her dead,' said
Mrs. Thornton, a good deal alarmed.

'It is only a fainting-fit. She has spoken to me since.' But all the
blood in his body seemed to rush inwards to his heart as he spoke, and
he absolutely trembled.

'Go and call Jane,--she can find me the things I want; and do you go to
your Irish people, who are crying and shouting as if they were mad with
fright.' He went. He went away as if weights were tied to every limb
that bore him from her. He called Jane; he called his sister. She should
have all womanly care, all gentle tendance. But every pulse beat in him
as he remembered how she had come down and placed herself in foremost
danger,--could it be to save him? At the time, he had pushed her aside,
and spoken gruffly; he had seen nothing but the unnecessary danger she
had placed herself in. He went to his Irish people, with every nerve in
his body thrilling at the thought of her, and found it difficult to
understand enough of what they were saying to soothe and comfort away
their fears. There, they declared, they would not stop; they claimed to
be sent back. And so he had to think, and talk, and reason.

Mrs. Thornton bathed Margaret's temples with eau de Cologne. As the
spirit touched the wound, which till then neither Mrs. Thornton nor Jane
had perceived, Margaret opened her eyes; but it was evident she did not
know where she was, nor who they were. The dark circles deepened, the
lips quivered and contracted, and she became insensible once more.

'She has had a terrible blow,' said Mrs. Thornton. 'Is there any one who
will go for a doctor?'

'Not me, ma'am, if you please,' said Jane, shrinking back. 'Them rabble
may be all about; I don't think the cut is so deep, ma'am, as it looks.'

'I will not run the chance. She was hurt in our house. If you are a
coward, Jane, I am not. I will go.'

'Pray, ma'am, let me send one of the police. There's ever so many come
up, and soldiers too.'

'And yet you're afraid to go! I will not have their time taken up with
our errands. They'll have enough to do to catch some of the mob. You
will not be afraid to stop in this house,' she asked contemptuously,
'and go on bathing Miss Hale's forehead, shall you? I shall not be ten
minutes away.'

'Couldn't Hannah go, ma'am?'

'Why Hannah? Why any but you? No, Jane, if you don't go, I do.'

Mrs. Thornton went first to the room in which she had left Fanny
stretched on the bed. She started up as her mother entered.

'Oh, mamma, how you terrified me! I thought you were a man that had got
into the house.'

'Nonsense! The men are all gone away. There are soldiers all round the
place, seeking for their work now it is too late. Miss Hale is lying on
the dining-room sofa badly hurt. I am going for the doctor.'

'Oh! don't, mamma! they'll murder you.' She clung to her mother's gown.
Mrs. Thornton wrenched it away with no gentle hand.

'Find me some one else to go but that girl must not bleed to death.'

'Bleed! oh, how horrid! How has she got hurt?'

'I don't know,--I have no time to ask. Go down to her, Fanny, and do try
to make yourself of use. Jane is with her; and I trust it looks worse
than it is. Jane has refused to leave the house, cowardly woman! And I
won't put myself in the way of any more refusals from my servants, so I
am going myself.'

'Oh, dear, dear!' said Fanny, crying, and preparing to go down rather
than be left alone, with the thought of wounds and bloodshed in the very
house.

'Oh, Jane!' said she, creeping into the dining-room, 'what is the
matter? How white she looks! How did she get hurt? Did they throw stones
into the drawing-room?'

Margaret did indeed look white and wan, although her senses were
beginning to return to her. But the sickly daze of the swoon made her
still miserably faint. She was conscious of movement around her, and of
refreshment from the eau de Cologne, and a craving for the bathing to go
on without intermission; but when they stopped to talk, she could no
more have opened her eyes, or spoken to ask for more bathing, than the
people who lie in death-like trance can move, or utter sound, to arrest
the awful preparations for their burial, while they are yet fully aware,
not merely of the actions of those around them, but of the idea that is
the motive for such actions.

Jane paused in her bathing, to reply to Miss Thornton's question.

'She'd have been safe enough, miss, if she'd stayed in the drawing-room,
or come up to us; we were in the front garret, and could see it all, out
of harm's way.'

'Where was she, then?' said Fanny, drawing nearer by slow degrees, as
she became accustomed to the sight of Margaret's pale face.

'Just before the front door--with master!' said Jane, significantly.

'With John! with my brother! How did she get there?'

'Nay, miss, that's not for me to say,' answered Jane, with a slight toss
of her head. 'Sarah did'----

'Sarah what?' said Fanny, with impatient curiosity.

Jane resumed her bathing, as if what Sarah did or said was not exactly
the thing she liked to repeat.

'Sarah what?' asked Fanny, sharply. 'Don't speak in these half
sentences, or I can't understand you.'

'Well, miss, since you will have it--Sarah, you see, was in the best
place for seeing, being at the right-hand window; and she says, and said
at the very time too, that she saw Miss Hale with her arms about
master's neck, hugging him before all the people.'

'I don't believe it,' said Fanny. 'I know she cares for my brother; any
one can see that; and I dare say, she'd give her eyes if he'd marry
her,--which he never will, I can tell her. But I don't believe she'd be
so bold and forward as to put her arms round his neck.'

'Poor young lady! she's paid for it dearly if she did. It's my belief,
that the blow has given her such an ascendency of blood to the head as
she'll never get the better from. She looks like a corpse now.'

'Oh, I wish mamma would come!' said Fanny, wringing her hands. 'I never
was in the room with a dead person before.'

'Stay, miss! She's not dead: her eye-lids are quivering, and here's wet
tears a-coming down her cheeks. Speak to her, Miss Fanny!'

'Are you better now?' asked Fanny, in a quavering voice.

No answer; no sign of recognition; but a faint pink colour returned to
her lips, although the rest of her face was ashen pale.

Mrs. Thornton came hurriedly in, with the nearest surgeon she could
find. 'How is she? Are you better, my dear?' as Margaret opened her
filmy eyes, and gazed dreamily at her. 'Here is Mr. Lowe come to see
you.'

Mrs. Thornton spoke loudly and distinctly, as to a deaf person. Margaret
tried to rise, and drew her ruffled, luxuriant hair instinctly over the
cut. 'I am better now,' said she, in a very low, faint voice. I was a
little sick.' She let him take her hand and feel her pulse. The bright
colour came for a moment into her face, when he asked to examine the
wound in her forehead; and she glanced up at Jane, as if shrinking from
her inspection more than from the doctor's.

'It is not much, I think. I am better now. I must go home.'

'Not until I have applied some strips of plaster; and you have rested a
little.'

She sat down hastily, without another word, and allowed it to be bound
up.

'Now, if you please,' said she, 'I must go. Mamma will not see it, I
think. It is under the hair, is it not?'

'Quite; no one could tell.'

'But you must not go,' said Mrs. Thornton, impatiently. 'You are not fit
to go.

'I must,' said Margaret, decidedly. 'Think of mamma. If they should
hear---- Besides, I must go,' said she, vehemently. 'I cannot stay here.
May I ask for a cab?'

'You are quite flushed and feverish,' observed Mr. Lowe.

'It is only with being here, when I do so want to go. The air--getting
away, would do me more good than anything,' pleaded she.

'I really believe it is as she says,' Mr. Lowe replied. 'If her mother
is so ill as you told me on the way here, it may be very serious if she
hears of this riot, and does not see her daughter back at the time she
expects. The injury is not deep. I will fetch a cab, if your servants
are still afraid to go out.'

'Oh, thank you!' said Margaret. 'It will do me more good than anything.
It is the air of this room that makes me feel so miserable.'

She leant back on the sofa, and closed her eyes. Fanny beckoned her
mother out of the room, and told her something that made her equally
anxious with Margaret for the departure of the latter. Not that she
fully believed Fanny's statement; but she credited enough to make her
manner to Margaret appear very much constrained, at wishing her
good-bye.

Mr. Lowe returned in the cab.

'If you will allow me, I will see you home, Miss Hale. The streets are
not very quiet yet.'

Margaret's thoughts were quite alive enough to the present to make her
desirous of getting rid of both Mr. Lowe and the cab before she reached
Crampton Crescent, for fear of alarming her father and mother. Beyond
that one aim she would not look. That ugly dream of insolent words
spoken about herself, could never be forgotten--but could be put aside
till she was stronger--for, oh! she was very weak; and her mind sought
for some present fact to steady itself upon, and keep it from utterly
losing consciousness in another hideous, sickly swoon.




CHAPTER XXIII

MISTAKES

    'Which when his mother saw, she in her mind
     Was troubled sore, ne wist well what to ween.'
             SPENSER.


Margaret had not been gone five minutes when Mr. Thornton came in, his
face all a-glow.

'I could not come sooner: the superintendent would---- Where is she?' He
looked round the dining-room, and then almost fiercely at his mother,
who was quietly re-arranging the disturbed furniture, and did not
instantly reply. 'Where is Miss Hale?' asked he again.

'Gone home,' said she, rather shortly.

'Gone home!'

'Yes. She was a great deal better. Indeed, I don't believe it was so
very much of a hurt; only some people faint at the least thing.'

'I am sorry she is gone home,' said he, walking uneasily about. 'She
could not have been fit for it.'

'She said she was; and Mr. Lowe said she was. I went for him myself.'

'Thank you, mother.' He stopped, and partly held out his hand to give
her a grateful shake. But she did not notice the movement.

'What have you done with your Irish people?'

'Sent to the Dragon for a good meal for them, poor wretches. And then,
luckily, I caught Father Grady, and I've asked him in to speak to them,
and dissuade them from going off in a body. How did Miss Hale go home?
I'm sure she could not walk.'

'She had a cab. Everything was done properly, even to the paying. Let us
talk of something else. She has caused disturbance enough.'

'I don't know where I should have been but for her.'

'Are you become so helpless as to have to be defended by a girl?' asked
Mrs. Thornton, scornfully.

He reddened. 'Not many girls would have taken the blows on herself which
were meant for me;--meant with right down good-will, too.'

'A girl in love will do a good deal,' replied Mrs. Thornton, shortly.

'Mother!' He made a step forwards; stood still; heaved with passion.

She was a little startled at the evident force he used to keep himself
calm. She was not sure of the nature of the emotions she had provoked.
It was only their violence that was clear. Was it anger? His eyes
glowed, his figure was dilated, his breath came thick and fast. It was a
mixture of joy, of anger, of pride, of glad surprise, of panting doubt;
but she could not read it. Still it made her uneasy,--as the presence of
all strong feeling, of which the cause is not fully understood or
sympathised in, always has this effect. She went to the side-board,
opened a drawer, and took out a duster, which she kept there for any
occasional purpose. She had seen a drop of eau de Cologne on the
polished arm of the sofa, and instinctively sought to wipe it off. But
she kept her back turned to her son much longer than was necessary; and
when she spoke, her voice seemed unusual and constrained.

'You have taken some steps about the rioters, I suppose? You don't
apprehend any more violence, do you? Where were the police? Never at
hand when they're wanted!'

'On the contrary, I saw three or four of them, when the gates gave way,
struggling and beating about in fine fashion; and more came running up
just when the yard was clearing. I might have given some of the fellows
in charge then, if I had had my wits about me. But there will be no
difficulty, plenty of people can identify them.'

'But won't they come back to-night?'

'I'm going to see about a sufficient guard for the premises. I have
appointed to meet Captain Hanbury in half an hour at the station.'

'You must have some tea first.'

'Tea! Yes, I suppose I must. It's half-past six, and I may be out for
some time. Don't sit up for me, mother.'

'You expect me to go to bed before I have seen you safe, do you?'

'Well, perhaps not.' He hesitated for a moment. 'But if I've time, I
shall go round by Crampton, after I've arranged with the police and seen
Hamper and Clarkson.' Their eyes met; they looked at each other intently
for a minute. Then she asked:

'Why are you going round by Crampton?'

'To ask after Miss Hale.'

'I will send. Williams must take the water-bed she came to ask for. He
shall inquire how she is.'

'I must go myself.'

'Not merely to ask how Miss Hale is?'

'No, not merely for that. I want to thank her for the way in which she
stood between me and the mob.'

'What made you go down at all? It was putting your head into the lion's
mouth!' He glanced sharply at her; saw that she did not know what had
passed between him and Margaret in the drawing-room; and replied by
another question:

'Shall you be afraid to be left without me, until I can get some of the
police; or had we better send Williams for them now, and they could be
here by the time we have done tea? There's no time to be lost. I must be
off in a quarter of an hour.'

Mrs. Thornton left the room. Her servants wondered at her directions,
usually so sharply-cut and decided, now confused and uncertain. Mr.
Thornton remained in the dining-room, trying to think of the business he
had to do at the police-office, and in reality thinking of Margaret.
Everything seemed dim and vague beyond--behind--besides the touch of her
arms round his neck--the soft clinging which made the dark colour come
and go in his cheek as he thought of it.

The tea would have been very silent, but for Fanny's perpetual
description of her own feelings; how she had been alarmed--and then
thought they were gone--and then felt sick and faint and trembling in
every limb.

'There, that's enough,' said her brother, rising from the table. 'The
reality was enough for me.' He was going to leave the room, when his
mother stopped him with her hand upon his arm.

'You will come back here before you go to the Hales', said she, in a
low, anxious voice.

'I know what I know,' said Fanny to herself.

'Why? Will it be too late to disturb them?'

'John, come back to me for this one evening. It will be late for Mrs.
Hale. But that is not it. To-morrow, you will---- Come back to-night,
John!' She had seldom pleaded with her son at all--she was too proud for
that: but she had never pleaded in vain.

'I will return straight here after I have done my business. You will be
sure to inquire after them?--after her?'

Mrs. Thornton was by no means a talkative companion to Fanny, nor yet a
good listener while her son was absent. But on his return, her eyes and
ears were keen to see and to listen to all the details which he could
give, as to the steps he had taken to secure himself, and those whom he
chose to employ, from any repetition of the day's outrages. He clearly
saw his object. Punishment and suffering, were the natural consequences
to those who had taken part in the riot. All that was necessary, in
order that property should be protected, and that the will of the
proprietor might cut to his end, clean and sharp as a sword.

'Mother! You know what I have got to say to Miss Hale, to-morrow?' The
question came upon her suddenly, during a pause in which she, at least,
had forgotten Margaret.

She looked up at him.

'Yes! I do. You can hardly do otherwise.'

'Do otherwise! I don't understand you.'

'I mean that, after allowing her feelings so to overcome her, I consider
you bound in honour--'

'Bound in honour,' said he, scornfully. 'I'm afraid honour has nothing
to do with it. "Her feelings overcome her!" What feelings do you mean?'

'Nay, John, there is no need to be angry. Did she not rush down, and
cling to you to save you from danger?'

'She did!' said he. 'But, mother,' continued he, stopping short in his
walk right in front of her, 'I dare not hope. I never was fainthearted
before; but I cannot believe such a creature cares for me.'

'Don't be foolish, John. Such a creature! Why, she might be a duke's
daughter, to hear you speak. And what proof more would you have, I
wonder, of her caring for you? I can believe she has had a struggle with
her aristocratic way of viewing things; but I like her the better for
seeing clearly at last. It is a good deal for me to say,' said Mrs.
Thornton, smiling slowly, while the tears stood in her eyes; 'for after
to-night, I stand second. It was to have you to myself, all to myself, a
few hours longer, that I begged you not to go till to-morrow!'

'Dearest mother!' (Still love is selfish, and in an instant he reverted
to his own hopes and fears in a way that drew the cold creeping shadow
over Mrs. Thornton's heart.) 'But I know she does not care for me. I
shall put myself at her feet--I must. If it were but one chance in a
thousand--or a million--I should do it.'

'Don't fear!' said his mother, crushing down her own personal
mortification at the little notice he had taken of the rare ebullition
of her maternal feelings--of the pang of jealousy that betrayed the
intensity of her disregarded love. 'Don't be afraid,' she said, coldly.
'As far as love may go she may be worthy of you. It must have taken a
good deal to overcome her pride. Don't be afraid, John,' said she,
kissing him, as she wished him good-night. And she went slowly and
majestically out of the room. But when she got into her own, she locked
the door, and sate down to cry unwonted tears.

Margaret entered the room (where her father and mother still sat,
holding low conversation together), looking very pale and white. She
came close up to them before she could trust herself to speak.

'Mrs. Thornton will send the water-bed, mamma.'

'Dear, how tired you look! Is it very hot, Margaret?'

'Very hot, and the streets are rather rough with the strike.'

Margaret's colour came back vivid and bright as ever; but it faded away
instantly.

'Here has been a message from Bessy Higgins, asking you to go to her,'
said Mrs. Hale. 'But I'm sure you look too tired.'

'Yes!' said Margaret. 'I am tired, I cannot go.'

She was very silent and trembling while she made tea. She was thankful
to see her father so much occupied with her mother as not to notice her
looks. Even after her mother went to bed, he was not content to be
absent from her, but undertook to read her to sleep. Margaret was alone.

'Now I will think of it--now I will remember it all. I could not
before--I dared not.' She sat still in her chair, her hands clasped on
her knees, her lips compressed, her eyes fixed as one who sees a vision.
She drew a deep breath.

'I, who hate scenes--I, who have despised people for showing
emotion--who have thought them wanting in self-control--I went down and
must needs throw myself into the melee, like a romantic fool! Did I do
any good? They would have gone away without me I dare say.' But this was
over-leaping the rational conclusion,--as in an instant her well-poised
judgment felt. 'No, perhaps they would not. I did some good. But what
possessed me to defend that man as if he were a helpless child! Ah!'
said she, clenching her hands together, 'it is no wonder those people
thought I was in love with him, after disgracing myself in that way. I
in love--and with him too!' Her pale cheeks suddenly became one flame of
fire; and she covered her face with her hands. When she took them away,
her palms were wet with scalding tears.

'Oh how low I am fallen that they should say that of me! I could not
have been so brave for any one else, just because he was so utterly
indifferent to me--if, indeed, I do not positively dislike him. It made
me the more anxious that there should be fair play on each side; and I
could see what fair play was. It was not fair,' said she, vehemently,
'that he should stand there--sheltered, awaiting the soldiers, who might
catch those poor maddened creatures as in a trap--without an effort on
his part, to bring them to reason. And it was worse than unfair for them
to set on him as they threatened. I would do it again, let who will say
what they like of me. If I saved one blow, one cruel, angry action that
might otherwise have been committed, I did a woman's work. Let them
insult my maiden pride as they will--I walk pure before God!'

She looked up, and a noble peace seemed to descend and calm her face,
till it was 'stiller than chiselled marble.'

Dixon came in:

'If you please, Miss Margaret, here's the water-bed from Mrs.
Thornton's. It's too late for to-night, I'm afraid, for missus is nearly
asleep: but it will do nicely for to-morrow.'

'Very,' said Margaret. 'You must send our best thanks.'

Dixon left the room for a moment.

'If you please, Miss Margaret, he says he's to ask particular how you
are. I think he must mean missus; but he says his last words were, to
ask how Miss Hale was.'

'Me!' said Margaret, drawing herself up. 'I am quite well. Tell him I am
perfectly well.' But her complexion was as deadly white as her
handkerchief; and her head ached intensely.

Mr. Hale now came in. He had left his sleeping wife; and wanted, as
Margaret saw, to be amused and interested by something that she was to
tell him. With sweet patience did she bear her pain, without a word of
complaint; and rummaged up numberless small subjects for
conversation--all except the riot, and that she never named once. It
turned her sick to think of it.

'Good-night, Margaret. I have every chance of a good night myself, and
you are looking very pale with your watching. I shall call Dixon if your
mother needs anything. Do you go to bed and sleep like a top; for I'm
sure you need it, poor child!'

'Good-night, papa.'

She let her colour go--the forced smile fade away--the eyes grow dull
with heavy pain. She released her strong will from its laborious task.
Till morning she might feel ill and weary.

She lay down and never stirred. To move hand or foot, or even so much as
one finger, would have been an exertion beyond the powers of either
volition or motion. She was so tired, so stunned, that she thought she
never slept at all; her feverish thoughts passed and repassed the
boundary between sleeping and waking, and kept their own miserable
identity. She could not be alone, prostrate, powerless as she was,--a
cloud of faces looked up at her, giving her no idea of fierce vivid
anger, or of personal danger, but a deep sense of shame that she should
thus be the object of universal regard--a sense of shame so acute that
it seemed as if she would fain have burrowed into the earth to hide
herself, and yet she could not escape out of that unwinking glare of
many eyes.




CHAPTER XXIV

MISTAKES CLEARED UP

    'Your beauty was the first that won the place,
     And scal'd the walls of my undaunted heart,
     Which, captive now, pines in a caitive case,
     Unkindly met with rigour for desert;--
     Yet not the less your servant shall abide,
     In spite of rude repulse or silent pride.'
             WILLIAM FOWLER.


The next morning, Margaret dragged herself up, thankful that the night
was over,--unrefreshed, yet rested. All had gone well through the house;
her mother had only wakened once. A little breeze was stirring in the
hot air, and though there were no trees to show the playful tossing
movement caused by the wind among the leaves, Margaret knew how,
somewhere or another, by way-side, in copses, or in thick green woods,
there was a pleasant, murmuring, dancing sound,--a rushing and falling
noise, the very thought of which was an echo of distant gladness in her
heart.

She sat at her work in Mrs. Hale's room. As soon as that forenoon
slumber was over, she would help her mother to dress after dinner, she
would go and see Bessy Higgins. She would banish all recollection of the
Thornton family,--no need to think of them till they absolutely stood
before her in flesh and blood. But, of course, the effort not to think
of them brought them only the more strongly before her; and from time to
time, the hot flush came over her pale face sweeping it into colour, as
a sunbeam from between watery clouds comes swiftly moving over the sea.

Dixon opened the door very softly, and stole on tiptoe up to Margaret,
sitting by the shaded window.

'Mr. Thornton, Miss Margaret. He is in the drawing-room.'

Margaret dropped her sewing.

'Did he ask for me? Isn't papa come in?'

'He asked for you, miss; and master is out.'

'Very well, I will come,' said Margaret, quietly. But she lingered
strangely. Mr. Thornton stood by one of the windows, with his back to
the door, apparently absorbed in watching something in the street. But,
in truth, he was afraid of himself. His heart beat thick at the thought
of her coming. He could not forget the touch of her arms around his
neck, impatiently felt as it had been at the time; but now the
recollection of her clinging defence of him, seemed to thrill him
through and through,--to melt away every resolution, all power of
self-control, as if it were wax before a fire. He dreaded lest he should
go forwards to meet her, with his arms held out in mute entreaty that
she would come and nestle there, as she had done, all unheeded, the day
before, but never unheeded again. His heart throbbed loud and quick.
Strong man as he was, he trembled at the anticipation of what he had to
say, and how it might be received. She might droop, and flush, and
flutter to his arms, as to her natural home and resting-place. One
moment, he glowed with impatience at the thought that she might do this,
the next, he feared a passionate rejection, the very idea of which
withered up his future with so deadly a blight that he refused to think
of it. He was startled by the sense of the presence of some one else in
the room. He turned round. She had come in so gently, that he had never
heard her; the street noises had been more distinct to his inattentive
ear than her slow movements, in her soft muslin gown.

She stood by the table, not offering to sit down. Her eyelids were
dropped half over her eyes; her teeth were shut, not compressed; her
lips were just parted over them, allowing the white line to be seen
between their curve. Her slow deep breathings dilated her thin and
beautiful nostrils; it was the only motion visible on her countenance.
The fine-grained skin, the oval cheek, the rich outline of her mouth,
its corners deep set in dimples,--were all wan and pale to-day; the loss
of their usual natural healthy colour being made more evident by the
heavy shadow of the dark hair, brought down upon the temples, to hide
all sign of the blow she had received. Her head, for all its drooping
eyes, was thrown a little back, in the old proud attitude. Her long arms
hung motion-less by her sides. Altogether she looked like some prisoner,
falsely accused of a crime that she loathed and despised, and from which
she was too indignant to justify herself.

Mr. Thornton made a hasty step or two forwards; recovered himself, and
went with quiet firmness to the door (which she had left open), and shut
it. Then he came back, and stood opposite to her for a moment, receiving
the general impression of her beautiful presence, before he dared to
disturb it, perhaps to repel it, by what he had to say.

'Miss Hale, I was very ungrateful yesterday--'

'You had nothing to be grateful for,' said she, raising her eyes, and
looking full and straight at him. 'You mean, I suppose, that you believe
you ought to thank me for what I did.' In spite of herself--in defiance
of her anger--the thick blushes came all over her face, and burnt into
her very eyes; which fell not nevertheless from their grave and steady
look. 'It was only a natural instinct; any woman would have done just
the same. We all feel the sanctity of our sex as a high privilege when
we see danger. I ought rather,' said she, hastily, 'to apologise to you,
for having said thoughtless words which sent you down into the danger.'

'It was not your words; it was the truth they conveyed, pungently as it
was expressed. But you shall not drive me off upon that, and so escape
the expression of my deep gratitude, my--' he was on the verge now; he
would not speak in the haste of his hot passion; he would weigh each
word. He would; and his will was triumphant. He stopped in mid career.

'I do not try to escape from anything,' said she. 'I simply say, that
you owe me no gratitude; and I may add, that any expression of it will
be painful to me, because I do not feel that I deserve it. Still, if it
will relieve you from even a fancied obligation, speak on.'

'I do not want to be relieved from any obligation,' said he, goaded by
her calm manner. 'Fancied, or not fancied--I question not myself to know
which--I choose to believe that I owe my very life to you--ay--smile,
and think it an exaggeration if you will. I believe it, because it adds
a value to that life to think--oh, Miss Hale!' continued he, lowering
his voice to such a tender intensity of passion that she shivered and
trembled before him, 'to think circumstance so wrought, that whenever I
exult in existence henceforward, I may say to myself, "All this gladness
in life, all honest pride in doing my work in the world, all this keen
sense of being, I owe to her!" And it doubles the gladness, it makes the
pride glow, it sharpens the sense of existence till I hardly know if it
is pain or pleasure, to think that I owe it to one--nay, you must, you
shall hear'--said he, stepping forwards with stern determination--'to
one whom I love, as I do not believe man ever loved woman before.' He
held her hand tight in his. He panted as he listened for what should
come. He threw the hand away with indignation, as he heard her icy tone;
for icy it was, though the words came faltering out, as if she knew not
where to find them.

'Your way of speaking shocks me. It is blasphemous. I cannot help it, if
that is my first feeling. It might not be so, I dare say, if I
understood the kind of feeling you describe. I do not want to vex you;
and besides, we must speak gently, for mamma is asleep; but your whole
manner offends me--'

'How!' exclaimed he. 'Offends you! I am indeed most unfortunate.'

'Yes!' said she, with recovered dignity. 'I do feel offended; and, I
think, justly. You seem to fancy that my conduct of yesterday'--again
the deep carnation blush, but this time with eyes kindling with
indignation rather than shame--'was a personal act between you and me;
and that you may come and thank me for it, instead of perceiving, as a
gentleman would--yes! a gentleman,' she repeated, in allusion to their
former conversation about that word, 'that any woman, worthy of the name
of woman, would come forward to shield, with her reverenced
helplessness, a man in danger from the violence of numbers.'

'And the gentleman thus rescued is forbidden the relief of thanks!' he
broke in contemptuously. 'I am a man. I claim the right of expressing my
feelings.'

'And I yielded to the right; simply saying that you gave me pain by
insisting upon it,' she replied, proudly. 'But you seem to have
imagined, that I was not merely guided by womanly instinct, but'--and
here the passionate tears (kept down for long--struggled with
vehemently) came up into her eyes, and choked her voice--'but that I was
prompted by some particular feeling for you--you! Why, there was not a
man--not a poor desperate man in all that crowd--for whom I had not more
sympathy--for whom I should not have done what little I could more
heartily.'

'You may speak on, Miss Hale. I am aware of all these misplaced
sympathies of yours. I now believe that it was only your innate sense of
oppression--(yes; I, though a master, may be oppressed)--that made you
act so nobly as you did. I know you despise me; allow me to say, it is
because you do not understand me.'

'I do not care to understand,' she replied, taking hold of the table to
steady herself; for she thought him cruel--as, indeed, he was--and she
was weak with her indignation.

'No, I see you do not. You are unfair and unjust.'

Margaret compressed her lips. She would not speak in answer to such
accusations. But, for all that--for all his savage words, he could have
thrown himself at her feet, and kissed the hem of her garment. She did
not speak; she did not move. The tears of wounded pride fell hot and
fast. He waited awhile, longing for her to say something, even a taunt,
to which he might reply. But she was silent. He took up his hat.

'One word more. You look as if you thought it tainted you to be loved by
me. You cannot avoid it. Nay, I, if I would, cannot cleanse you from it.
But I would not, if I could. I have never loved any woman before: my
life has been too busy, my thoughts too much absorbed with other things.
Now I love, and will love. But do not be afraid of too much expression
on my part.'

'I am not afraid,' she replied, lifting herself straight up. 'No one yet
has ever dared to be impertinent to me, and no one ever shall. But, Mr.
Thornton, you have been very kind to my father,' said she, changing her
whole tone and bearing to a most womanly softness. 'Don't let us go on
making each other angry. Pray don't!' He took no notice of her words: he
occupied himself in smoothing the nap of his hat with his coat-sleeve,
for half a minute or so; and then, rejecting her offered hand, and
making as if he did not see her grave look of regret, he turned abruptly
away, and left the room. Margaret caught one glance at his face before
he went.

When he was gone, she thought she had seen the gleam of unshed tears in
his eyes; and that turned her proud dislike into something different and
kinder, if nearly as painful--self-reproach for having caused such
mortification to any one.

'But how could I help it?' asked she of herself. 'I never liked him. I
was civil; but I took no trouble to conceal my indifference. Indeed, I
never thought about myself or him, so my manners must have shown the
truth. All that yesterday, he might mistake. But that is his fault, not
mine. I would do it again, if need were, though it does lead me into all
this shame and trouble.'




CHAPTER XXV

FREDERICK

    'Revenge may have her own;
     Roused discipline aloud proclaims their cause,
     And injured navies urge their broken laws.'
             BYRON.


Margaret began to wonder whether all offers were as unexpected
beforehand,--as distressing at the time of their occurrence, as the two
she had had. An involuntary comparison between Mr. Lennox and Mr.
Thornton arose in her mind. She had been sorry that an expression of any
other feeling than friendship had been lured out by circumstances from
Henry Lennox. That regret was the predominant feeling, on the first
occasion of her receiving a proposal. She had not felt so stunned--so
impressed as she did now, when echoes of Mr. Thornton's voice yet
lingered about the room. In Lennox's case, he seemed for a moment to
have slid over the boundary between friendship and love; and the instant
afterwards, to regret it nearly as much as she did, although for
different reasons. In Mr. Thornton's case, as far as Margaret knew,
there was no intervening stage of friendship. Their intercourse had been
one continued series of opposition. Their opinions clashed; and indeed,
she had never perceived that he had cared for her opinions, as belonging
to her, the individual. As far as they defied his rock-like power of
character, his passion-strength, he seemed to throw them off from him
with contempt, until she felt the weariness of the exertion of making
useless protests; and now, he had come, in this strange wild passionate
way, to make known his love. For, although at first it had struck her,
that his offer was forced and goaded out of him by sharp compassion for
the exposure she had made of herself,--which he, like others, might
misunderstand--yet, even before he left the room,--and certainly, not
five minutes after, the clear conviction dawned upon her, shined bright
upon her, that he did love her; that he had loved her; that he would
love her. And she shrank and shuddered as under the fascination of some
great power, repugnant to her whole previous life. She crept away, and
hid from his idea. But it was of no use. To parody a line out of
Fairfax's Tasso--

    'His strong idea wandered through her thought.'

She disliked him the more for having mastered her inner will. How dared
he say that he would love her still, even though she shook him off with
contempt? She wished she had spoken more--stronger. Sharp, decisive
speeches came thronging into her mind, now that it was too late to utter
them. The deep impression made by the interview, was like that of a
horror in a dream; that will not leave the room although we waken up,
and rub our eyes, and force a stiff rigid smile upon our lips. It is
there--there, cowering and gibbering, with fixed ghastly eyes, in some
corner of the chamber, listening to hear whether we dare to breathe of
its presence to any one. And we dare not; poor cowards that we are!

And so she shuddered away from the threat of his enduring love. What did
he mean? Had she not the power to daunt him? She would see. It was more
daring than became a man to threaten her so. Did he ground it upon the
miserable yesterday? If need were, she would do the same to-morrow,--by
a crippled beggar, willingly and gladly,--but by him, she would do it,
just as bravely, in spite of his deductions, and the cold slime of
women's impertinence. She did it because it was right, and simple, and
true to save where she could save; even to try to save. 'Fais ce que
dois, advienne que pourra.'

Hitherto she had not stirred from where he had left her; no outward
circumstances had roused her out of the trance of thought in which she
had been plunged by his last words, and by the look of his deep intent
passionate eyes, as their flames had made her own fall before them. She
went to the window, and threw it open, to dispel the oppression which
hung around her. Then she went and opened the door, with a sort of
impetuous wish to shake off the recollection of the past hour in the
company of others, or in active exertion. But all was profoundly hushed
in the noonday stillness of a house, where an invalid catches the
unrefreshing sleep that is denied to the night-hours. Margaret would not
be alone. What should she do? 'Go and see Bessy Higgins, of course,'
thought she, as the recollection of the message sent the night before
flashed into her mind.

And away she went.

When she got there, she found Bessy lying on the settle, moved close to
the fire, though the day was sultry and oppressive. She was laid down
quite flat, as if resting languidly after some paroxysm of pain.
Margaret felt sure she ought to have the greater freedom of breathing
which a more sitting posture would procure; and, without a word, she
raised her up, and so arranged the pillows, that Bessy was more at ease,
though very languid.

'I thought I should na' ha' seen yo' again,' said she, at last, looking
wistfully in Margaret's face.

'I'm afraid you're much worse. But I could not have come yesterday, my
mother was so ill--for many reasons,' said Margaret, colouring.

'Yo'd m'appen think I went beyond my place in sending Mary for yo'. But
the wranglin' and the loud voices had just torn me to pieces, and I
thought when father left, oh! if I could just hear her voice, reading me
some words o' peace and promise, I could die away into the silence and
rest o' God, just as a babby is hushed up to sleep by its mother's
lullaby.'

'Shall I read you a chapter, now?'

'Ay, do! M'appen I shan't listen to th' sense, at first; it will seem
far away--but when yo' come to words I like--to th' comforting
texts--it'll seem close in my ear, and going through me as it were.'

Margaret began. Bessy tossed to and fro. If, by an effort, she attended
for one moment, it seemed as though she were convulsed into double
restlessness the next. At last, she burst out 'Don't go on reading. It's
no use. I'm blaspheming all the time in my mind, wi' thinking angrily on
what canna be helped.--Yo'd hear of th' riot, m'appen, yesterday at
Marlborough Mills? Thornton's factory, yo' know.'

'Your father was not there, was he?' said Margaret, colouring deep.

'Not he. He'd ha' given his right hand if it had never come to pass.
It's that that's fretting me. He's fairly knocked down in his mind by
it. It's no use telling him, fools will always break out o' bounds. Yo'
never saw a man so down-hearted as he is.'

'But why?' asked Margaret. 'I don't understand.'

'Why yo' see, he's a committee-man on this special strike'. Th' Union
appointed him because, though I say it as shouldn't say it, he's
reckoned a deep chap, and true to th' back-bone. And he and t' other
committee-men laid their plans. They were to hou'd together through
thick and thin; what the major part thought, t'others were to think,
whether they would or no. And above all there was to be no going again
the law of the land. Folk would go with them if they saw them striving
and starving wi' dumb patience; but if there was once any noise o'
fighting and struggling--even wi' knobsticks--all was up, as they knew
by th' experience of many, and many a time before. They would try and
get speech o' th' knobsticks, and coax 'em, and reason wi' 'em, and
m'appen warn 'em off; but whatever came, the Committee charged all
members o' th' Union to lie down and die, if need were, without striking
a blow; and then they reckoned they were sure o' carrying th' public
with them. And beside all that, Committee knew they were right in their
demand, and they didn't want to have right all mixed up wi' wrong, till
folk can't separate it, no more nor I can th' physic-powder from th'
jelly yo' gave me to mix it in; jelly is much the biggest, but powder
tastes it all through. Well, I've told yo' at length about this'n, but
I'm tired out. Yo' just think for yo'rsel, what it mun be for father to
have a' his work undone, and by such a fool as Boucher, who must needs
go right again the orders of Committee, and ruin th' strike, just as bad
as if he meant to be a Judas. Eh! but father giv'd it him last night! He
went so far as to say, he'd go and tell police where they might find th'
ringleader o' th' riot; he'd give him up to th' mill-owners to do what
they would wi' him. He'd show the world that th' real leaders o' the
strike were not such as Boucher, but steady thoughtful men; good hands,
and good citizens, who were friendly to law and judgment, and would
uphold order; who only wanted their right wage, and wouldn't work, even
though they starved, till they got 'em; but who would ne'er injure
property or life: For,' dropping her voice, 'they do say, that Boucher
threw a stone at Thornton's sister, that welly killed her.'

'That's not true,' said Margaret. 'It was not Boucher that threw the
stone'--she went first red, then white.

'Yo'd be there then, were yo'?' asked Bessy languidly for indeed, she
had spoken with many pauses, as if speech was unusually difficult to
her.

'Yes. Never mind. Go on. Only it was not Boucher that threw the stone.
But what did he answer to your father?'

'He did na' speak words. He were all in such a tremble wi' spent
passion, I could na' bear to look at him. I heard his breath coming
quick, and at one time I thought he were sobbing. But when father said
he'd give him up to police, he gave a great cry, and struck father on
th' face wi' his closed fist, and be off like lightning. Father were
stunned wi' the blow at first, for all Boucher were weak wi' passion and
wi' clemming. He sat down a bit, and put his hand afore his eyes; and
then made for th' door. I dunno' where I got strength, but I threw
mysel' off th' settle and clung to him. "Father, father!" said I.
"Thou'll never go peach on that poor clemmed man. I'll never leave go on
thee, till thou sayst thou wunnot." "Dunnot be a fool," says he, "words
come readier than deeds to most men. I never thought o' telling th'
police on him; though by G--, he deserves it, and I should na' ha'
minded if some one else had done the dirty work, and got him clapped up.
But now he has strucken me, I could do it less nor ever, for it would be
getting other men to take up my quarrel. But if ever he gets well o'er
this clemming, and is in good condition, he and I'll have an up and down
fight, purring an' a', and I'll see what I can do for him." And so
father shook me off,--for indeed, I was low and faint enough, and his
face was all clay white, where it weren't bloody, and turned me sick to
look at. And I know not if I slept or waked, or were in a dead swoon,
till Mary come in; and I telled her to fetch yo' to me. And now dunnot
talk to me, but just read out th' chapter. I'm easier in my mind for
having spit it out; but I want some thoughts of the world that's far
away to take the weary taste of it out o' my mouth. Read me--not a
sermon chapter, but a story chapter; they've pictures in them, which I
see when my eyes are shut. Read about the New Heavens, and the New
Earth; and m'appen I'll forget this.'

Margaret read in her soft low voice. Though Bessy's eyes were shut, she
was listening for some time, for the moisture of tears gathered heavy on
her eyelashes. At last she slept; with many starts, and muttered
pleadings. Margaret covered her up, and left her, for she had an uneasy
consciousness that she might be wanted at home, and yet, until now, it
seemed cruel to leave the dying girl. Mrs. Hale was in the drawing-room
on her daughter's return. It was one of her better days, and she was
full of praises of the water-bed. It had been more like the beds at Sir
John Beresford's than anything she had slept on since. She did not know
how it was, but people seemed to have lost the art of making the same
kind of beds as they used to do in her youth. One would think it was
easy enough; there was the same kind of feathers to be had, and yet
somehow, till this last night she did not know when she had had a good
sound resting sleep. Mr. Hale suggested, that something of the merits of
the featherbeds of former days might be attributed to the activity of
youth, which gave a relish to rest; but this idea was not kindly
received by his wife.

'No, indeed, Mr. Hale, it was those beds at Sir John's. Now, Margaret,
you're young enough, and go about in the day; are the beds comfortable?
I appeal to you. Do they give you a feeling of perfect repose when you
lie down upon them; or rather, don't you toss about, and try in vain to
find an easy position, and waken in the morning as tired as when you
went to bed?'

Margaret laughed. 'To tell the truth, mamma, I've never thought about my
bed at all, what kind it is. I'm so sleepy at night, that if I only lie
down anywhere, I nap off directly. So I don't think I'm a competent
witness. But then, you know, I never had the opportunity of trying Sir
John Beresford's beds. I never was at Oxenham.'

'Were not you? Oh, no! to be sure. It was poor darling Fred I took with
me, I remember. I only went to Oxenham once after I was married,--to
your Aunt Shaw's wedding; and poor little Fred was the baby then. And I
know Dixon did not like changing from lady's maid to nurse, and I was
afraid that if I took her near her old home, and amongst her own people,
she might want to leave me. But poor baby was taken ill at Oxenham, with
his teething; and, what with my being a great deal with Anna just before
her marriage, and not being very strong myself, Dixon had more of the
charge of him than she ever had before; and it made her so fond of him,
and she was so proud when he would turn away from every one and cling to
her, that I don't believe she ever thought of leaving me again; though
it was very different from what she'd been accustomed to. Poor Fred!
Everybody loved him. He was born with the gift of winning hearts. It
makes me think very badly of Captain Reid when I know that he disliked
my own dear boy. I think it a certain proof he had a bad heart. Ah! Your
poor father, Margaret. He has left the room. He can't bear to hear Fred
spoken of.'

'I love to hear about him, mamma. Tell me all you like; you never can
tell me too much. Tell me what he was like as a baby.'

'Why, Margaret, you must not be hurt, but he was much prettier than you
were. I remember, when I first saw you in Dixon's arms, I said, "Dear,
what an ugly little thing!" And she said, "It's not every child that's
like Master Fred, bless him!" Dear! how well I remember it. Then I could
have had Fred in my arms every minute of the day, and his cot was close
by my bed; and now, now--Margaret--I don't know where my boy is, and
sometimes I think I shall never see him again.'

Margaret sat down by her mother's sofa on a little stool, and softly
took hold of her hand, caressing it and kissing it, as if to comfort.
Mrs. Hale cried without restraint. At last, she sat straight, stiff up
on the sofa, and turning round to her daughter, she said with tearful,
almost solemn earnestness, 'Margaret, if I can get better,--if God lets
me have a chance of recovery, it must be through seeing my son Frederick
once more. It will waken up all the poor springs of health left in me.

She paused, and seemed to try and gather strength for something more yet
to be said. Her voice was choked as she went on--was quavering as with
the contemplation of some strange, yet closely-present idea.

'And, Margaret, if I am to die--if I am one of those appointed to die
before many weeks are over--I must see my child first. I cannot think
how it must be managed; but I charge you, Margaret, as you yourself hope
for comfort in your last illness, bring him to me that I may bless him.
Only for five minutes, Margaret. There could be no danger in five
minutes. Oh, Margaret, let me see him before I die!'

Margaret did not think of anything that might be utterly unreasonable in
this speech: we do not look for reason or logic in the passionate
entreaties of those who are sick unto death; we are stung with the
recollection of a thousand slighted opportunities of fulfilling the
wishes of those who will soon pass away from among us: and do they ask
us for the future happiness of our lives, we lay it at their feet, and
will it away from us. But this wish of Mrs. Hale's was so natural, so
just, so right to both parties, that Margaret felt as if, on Frederick's
account as well as on her mother's, she ought to overlook all
intermediate chances of danger, and pledge herself to do everything in
her power for its realisation. The large, pleading, dilated eyes were
fixed upon her wistfully, steady in their gaze, though the poor white
lips quivered like those of a child. Margaret gently rose up and stood
opposite to her frail mother; so that she might gather the secure
fulfilment of her wish from the calm steadiness of her daughter's face.

'Mamma, I will write to-night, and tell Frederick what you say. I am as
sure that he will come directly to us, as I am sure of my life. Be easy,
mamma, you shall see him as far as anything earthly can be promised.'

'You will write to-night? Oh, Margaret! the post goes out at five--you
will write by it, won't you? I have so few hours left--I feel, dear, as
if I should not recover, though sometimes your father over-persuades me
into hoping; you will write directly, won't you? Don't lose a single
post; for just by that very post I may miss him.'

'But, mamma, papa is out.'

'Papa is out! and what then? Do you mean that he would deny me this last
wish, Margaret? Why, I should not be ill--be dying--if he had not taken
me away from Helstone, to this unhealthy, smoky, sunless place.'

'Oh, mamma!' said Margaret.

'Yes; it is so, indeed. He knows it himself; he has said so many a time.
He would do anything for me; you don't mean he would refuse me this last
wish--prayer, if you will. And, indeed, Margaret, the longing to see
Frederick stands between me and God. I cannot pray till I have this one
thing; indeed, I cannot. Don't lose time, dear, dear Margaret. Write by
this very next post. Then he may be here--here in twenty-two days! For
he is sure to come. No cords or chains can keep him. In twenty-two days
I shall see my boy.' She fell back, and for a short time she took no
notice of the fact that Margaret sat motionless, her hand shading her
eyes.

'You are not writing!' said her mother at last 'Bring me some pens and
paper; I will try and write myself.' She sat up, trembling all over with
feverish eagerness. Margaret took her hand down and looked at her mother
sadly.

'Only wait till papa comes in. Let us ask him how best to do it.'

'You promised, Margaret, not a quarter of an hour ago;--you said he
should come.'

'And so he shall, mamma; don't cry, my own dear mother. I'll write here,
now,--you shall see me write,--and it shall go by this very post; and if
papa thinks fit, he can write again when he comes in,--it is only a
day's delay. Oh, mamma, don't cry so pitifully,--it cuts me to the
heart.'

Mrs. Hale could not stop her tears; they came hysterically; and, in
truth, she made no effort to control them, but rather called up all the
pictures of the happy past, and the probable future--painting the scene
when she should lie a corpse, with the son she had longed to see in life
weeping over her, and she unconscious of his presence--till she was
melted by self-pity into a state of sobbing and exhaustion that made
Margaret's heart ache. But at last she was calm, and greedily watched
her daughter, as she began her letter; wrote it with swift urgent
entreaty; sealed it up hurriedly, for fear her mother should ask to see
it: and then, to make security most sure, at Mrs. Hale's own bidding,
took it herself to the post-office. She was coming home when her father
overtook her.

'And where have you been, my pretty maid?' asked he.

'To the post-office,--with a letter; a letter to Frederick. Oh, papa,
perhaps I have done wrong: but mamma was seized with such a passionate
yearning to see him--she said it would make her well again,--and then
she said that she must see him before she died,--I cannot tell you how
urgent she was! Did I do wrong?' Mr. Hale did not reply at first. Then
he said:

'You should have waited till I came in, Margaret.'

'I tried to persuade her--' and then she was silent.

'I don't know,' said Mr. Hale, after a pause. 'She ought to see him if
she wishes it so much, for I believe it would do her much more good than
all the doctor's medicine,--and, perhaps, set her up altogether; but the
danger to him, I'm afraid, is very great.'

'All these years since the mutiny, papa?'

'Yes; it is necessary, of course, for government to take very stringent
measures for the repression of offences against authority, more
particularly in the navy, where a commanding officer needs to be
surrounded in his men's eyes with a vivid consciousness of all the power
there is at home to back him, and take up his cause, and avenge any
injuries offered to him, if need be. Ah! it's no matter to them how far
their authorities have tyrannised,--galled hasty tempers to
madness,--or, if that can be any excuse afterwards, it is never allowed
for in the first instance; they spare no expense, they send out
ships,--they scour the seas to lay hold of the offenders,--the lapse of
years does not wash out the memory of the offence,--it is a fresh and
vivid crime on the Admiralty books till it is blotted out by blood.'

'Oh, papa, what have I done! And yet it seemed so right at the time. I'm
sure Frederick himself, would run the risk.'

'So he would; so he should! Nay, Margaret, I'm glad it is done, though I
durst not have done it myself. I'm thankful it is as it is; I should
have hesitated till, perhaps, it might have been too late to do any
good. Dear Margaret, you have done what is right about it; and the end
is beyond our control.'

It was all very well; but her father's account of the relentless manner
in which mutinies were punished made Margaret shiver and creep. If she
had decoyed her brother home to blot out the memory of his error by his
blood! She saw her father's anxiety lay deeper than the source of his
latter cheering words. She took his arm and walked home pensively and
wearily by his side.




CHAPTER XXVI

MOTHER AND SON

    'I have found that holy place of rest
     Still changeless.'
             MRS. HEMANS.


When Mr. Thornton had left the house that morning he was almost blinded
by his baffled passion. He was as dizzy as if Margaret, instead of
looking, and speaking, and moving like a tender graceful woman, had been
a sturdy fish-wife, and given him a sound blow with her fists. He had
positive bodily pain,--a violent headache, and a throbbing intermittent
pulse. He could not bear the noise, the garish light, the continued
rumble and movement of the street. He called himself a fool for
suffering so; and yet he could not, at the moment, recollect the cause
of his suffering, and whether it was adequate to the consequences it had
produced. It would have been a relief to him, if he could have sat down
and cried on a door-step by a little child, who was raging and storming,
through his passionate tears, at some injury he had received. He said to
himself, that he hated Margaret, but a wild, sharp sensation of love
cleft his dull, thunderous feeling like lightning, even as he shaped the
words expressive of hatred. His greatest comfort was in hugging his
torment; and in feeling, as he had indeed said to her, that though she
might despise him, contemn him, treat him with her proud sovereign
indifference, he did not change one whit. She could not make him change.
He loved her, and would love her; and defy her, and this miserable
bodily pain.

He stood still for a moment, to make this resolution firm and clear.
There was an omnibus passing--going into the country; the conductor
thought he was wishing for a place, and stopped near the pavement. It
was too much trouble to apologise and explain; so he mounted upon it,
and was borne away,--past long rows of houses--then past detached villas
with trim gardens, till they came to real country hedge-rows, and,
by-and-by, to a small country town. Then everybody got down; and so did
Mr. Thornton, and because they walked away he did so too. He went into
the fields, walking briskly, because the sharp motion relieved his mind.
He could remember all about it now; the pitiful figure he must have cut;
the absurd way in which he had gone and done the very thing he had so
often agreed with himself in thinking would be the most foolish thing in
the world; and had met with exactly the consequences which, in these
wise moods, he had always fore-told were certain to follow, if he ever
did make such a fool of himself. Was he bewitched by those beautiful
eyes, that soft, half-open, sighing mouth which lay so close upon his
shoulder only yesterday? He could not even shake off the recollection
that she had been there; that her arms had been round him, once--if
never again. He only caught glimpses of her; he did not understand her
altogether. At one time she was so brave, and at another so timid; now
so tender, and then so haughty and regal-proud. And then he thought over
every time he had ever seen her once again, by way of finally forgetting
her. He saw her in every dress, in every mood, and did not know which
became her best. Even this morning, how magnificent she had looked,--her
eyes flashing out upon him at the idea that, because she had shared his
danger yesterday, she had cared for him the least!

If Mr. Thornton was a fool in the morning, as he assured himself at
least twenty times he was, he did not grow much wiser in the afternoon.
All that he gained in return for his sixpenny omnibus ride, was a more
vivid conviction that there never was, never could be, any one like
Margaret; that she did not love him and never would; but that she--no!
nor the whole world--should never hinder him from loving her. And so he
returned to the little market-place, and remounted the omnibus to return
to Milton.

It was late in the afternoon when he was set down, near his warehouse.
The accustomed places brought back the accustomed habits and trains of
thought. He knew how much he had to do--more than his usual work, owing
to the commotion of the day before. He had to see his brother
magistrates; he had to complete the arrangements, only half made in the
morning, for the comfort and safety of his newly imported Irish hands;
he had to secure them from all chance of communication with the
discontented work-people of Milton. Last of all, he had to go home and
encounter his mother.

Mrs. Thornton had sat in the dining-room all day, every moment expecting
the news of her son's acceptance by Miss Hale. She had braced herself up
many and many a time, at some sudden noise in the house; had caught up
the half-dropped work, and begun to ply her needle diligently, though
through dimmed spectacles, and with an unsteady hand! and many times had
the door opened, and some indifferent person entered on some
insignificant errand. Then her rigid face unstiffened from its gray
frost-bound expression, and the features dropped into the relaxed look
of despondency, so unusual to their sternness. She wrenched herself away
from the contemplation of all the dreary changes that would be brought
about to herself by her son's marriage; she forced her thoughts into the
accustomed household grooves. The newly-married couple-to-be would need
fresh household stocks of linen; and Mrs. Thornton had clothes-basket
upon clothes-basket, full of table-cloths and napkins, brought in, and
began to reckon up the store. There was some confusion between what was
hers, and consequently marked G. H. T. (for George and Hannah Thornton),
and what was her son's--bought with his money, marked with his initials.
Some of those marked G. H. T. were Dutch damask of the old kind,
exquisitely fine; none were like them now. Mrs. Thornton stood looking
at them long,--they had been her pride when she was first married. Then
she knit her brows, and pinched and compressed her lips tight, and
carefully unpicked the G. H. She went so far as to search for the
Turkey-red marking-thread to put in the new initials; but it was all
used,--and she had no heart to send for any more just yet. So she looked
fixedly at vacancy; a series of visions passing before her, in all of
which her son was the principal, the sole object,--her son, her pride,
her property. Still he did not come. Doubtless he was with Miss Hale.
The new love was displacing her already from her place as first in his
heart. A terrible pain--a pang of vain jealousy--shot through her: she
hardly knew whether it was more physical or mental; but it forced her to
sit down. In a moment, she was up again as straight as ever,--a grim
smile upon her face for the first time that day, ready for the door
opening, and the rejoicing triumphant one, who should never know the
sore regret his mother felt at his marriage. In all this, there was
little thought enough of the future daughter-in-law as an individual.
She was to be John's wife. To take Mrs. Thornton's place as mistress of
the house, was only one of the rich consequences which decked out the
supreme glory; all household plenty and comfort, all purple and fine
linen, honour, love, obedience, troops of friends, would all come as
naturally as jewels on a king's robe, and be as little thought of for
their separate value. To be chosen by John, would separate a
kitchen-wench from the rest of the world. And Miss Hale was not so bad.
If she had been a Milton lass, Mrs. Thornton would have positively liked
her. She was pungent, and had taste, and spirit, and flavour in her.
True, she was sadly prejudiced, and very ignorant; but that was to be
expected from her southern breeding. A strange sort of mortified
comparison of Fanny with her, went on in Mrs. Thornton's mind; and for
once she spoke harshly to her daughter; abused her roundly; and then, as
if by way of penance, she took up Henry's Commentaries, and tried to fix
her attention on it, instead of pursuing the employment she took pride
and pleasure in, and continuing her inspection of the table-linen.

_His_ step at last! She heard him, even while she thought she was
finishing a sentence; while her eye did pass over it, and her memory
could mechanically have repeated it word for word, she heard him come in
at the hall-door. Her quickened sense could interpret every sound of
motion: now he was at the hat-stand--now at the very room-door. Why did
he pause? Let her know the worst.

Yet her head was down over the book; she did not look up. He came close
to the table, and stood still there, waiting till she should have
finished the paragraph which apparently absorbed her. By an effort she
looked up. 'Well, John?'

He knew what that little speech meant. But he had steeled himself. He
longed to reply with a jest; the bitterness of his heart could have
uttered one, but his mother deserved better of him. He came round behind
her, so that she could not see his looks, and, bending back her gray,
stony face, he kissed it, murmuring:

'No one loves me,--no one cares for me, but you, mother.'

He turned away and stood leaning his head against the mantel-piece,
tears forcing themselves into his manly eyes. She stood up,--she
tottered. For the first time in her life, the strong woman tottered. She
put her hands on his shoulders; she was a tall woman. She looked into
his face; she made him look at her.

'Mother's love is given by God, John. It holds fast for ever and ever. A
girl's love is like a puff of smoke,--it changes with every wind. And
she would not have you, my own lad, would not she?' She set her teeth;
she showed them like a dog for the whole length of her mouth. He shook
his head.

'I am not fit for her, mother; I knew I was not.'

She ground out words between her closed teeth. He could not hear what
she said; but the look in her eyes interpreted it to be a curse,--if not
as coarsely worded, as fell in intent as ever was uttered. And yet her
heart leapt up light, to know he was her own again.

'Mother!' said he, hurriedly, 'I cannot hear a word against her. Spare
me,--spare me! I am very weak in my sore heart;--I love her yet; I love
her more than ever.'

'And I hate her,' said Mrs. Thornton, in a low fierce voice. 'I tried
not to hate her, when she stood between you and me, because,--I said to
myself,--she will make him happy; and I would give my heart's blood to
do that. But now, I hate her for your misery's sake. Yes, John, it's no
use hiding up your aching heart from me. I am the mother that bore you,
and your sorrow is my agony; and if you don't hate her, I do.'

'Then, mother, you make me love her more. She is unjustly treated by
you, and I must make the balance even. But why do we talk of love or
hatred? She does not care for me, and that is enough,--too much. Let us
never name the subject again. It is the only thing you can do for me in
the matter. Let us never name her.'

'With all my heart. I only wish that she, and all belonging to her, were
swept back to the place they came from.'

He stood still, gazing into the fire for a minute or two longer. Her dry
dim eyes filled with unwonted tears as she looked at him; but she seemed
just as grim and quiet as usual when he next spoke.

'Warrants are out against three men for conspiracy, mother. The riot
yesterday helped to knock up the strike.'

And Margaret's name was no more mentioned between Mrs. Thornton and her
son. They fell back into their usual mode of talk,--about facts, not
opinions, far less feelings. Their voices and tones were calm and cold a
stranger might have gone away and thought that he had never seen such
frigid indifference of demeanour between such near relations.




CHAPTER XXVII

FRUIT-PIECE

    'For never any thing can be amiss
     When simpleness and duty tender it.'
             MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.


Mr. Thornton went straight and clear into all the interests of the
following day. There was a slight demand for finished goods; and as it
affected his branch of the trade, he took advantage of it, and drove
hard bargains. He was sharp to the hour at the meeting of his brother
magistrates,--giving them the best assistance of his strong sense, and
his power of seeing consequences at a glance, and so coming to a rapid
decision. Older men, men of long standing in the town, men of far
greater wealth--realised and turned into land, while his was all
floating capital, engaged in his trade--looked to him for prompt, ready
wisdom. He was the one deputed to see and arrange with the police--to
lead in all the requisite steps. And he cared for their unconscious
deference no more than for the soft west wind, that scarcely made the
smoke from the great tall chimneys swerve in its straight upward course.
He was not aware of the silent respect paid to him. If it had been
otherwise, he would have felt it as an obstacle in his progress to the
object he had in view. As it was, he looked to the speedy accomplishment
of that alone. It was his mother's greedy ears that sucked in, from the
women-kind of these magistrates and wealthy men, how highly Mr. This or
Mr. That thought of Mr. Thornton; that if he had not been there, things
would have gone on very differently,--very badly, indeed. He swept off
his business right and left that day. It seemed as though his deep
mortification of yesterday, and the stunned purposeless course of the
hours afterwards, had cleared away all the mists from his intellect. He
felt his power and revelled in it. He could almost defy his heart. If he
had known it, he could have sang the song of the miller who lived by the
river Dee:--

    'I care for nobody--
     Nobody cares for me.'

The evidence against Boucher, and other ringleaders of the riot, was
taken before him; that against the three others, for conspiracy, failed.
But he sternly charged the police to be on the watch; for the swift
right arm of the law should be in readiness to strike, as soon as they
could prove a fault. And then he left the hot reeking room in the
borough court, and went out into the fresher, but still sultry street.
It seemed as though he gave way all at once; he was so languid that he
could not control his thoughts; they would wander to her; they would
bring back the scene,--not of his repulse and rejection the day before
but the looks, the actions of the day before that. He went along the
crowded streets mechanically, winding in and out among the people, but
never seeing them,--almost sick with longing for that one
half-hour--that one brief space of time when she clung to him, and her
heart beat against his--to come once again.

'Why, Mr. Thornton you're cutting me very coolly, I must say. And how is
Mrs. Thornton? Brave weather this! We doctors don't like it, I can tell
you!'

'I beg your pardon, Dr. Donaldson. I really didn't see you. My mother's
quite well, thank you. It is a fine day, and good for the harvest, I
hope. If the wheat is well got in, we shall have a brisk trade next
year, whatever you doctors have.'

'Ay, ay. Each man for himself. Your bad weather, and your bad times, are
my good ones. When trade is bad, there's more undermining of health, and
preparation for death, going on among you Milton men than you're aware
of.'

'Not with me, Doctor. I'm made of iron. The news of the worst bad debt I
ever had, never made my pulse vary. This strike, which affects me more
than any one else in Milton,--more than Hamper,--never comes near my
appetite. You must go elsewhere for a patient, Doctor.'

'By the way, you've recommended me a good patient, poor lady! Not to go
on talking in this heartless way, I seriously believe that Mrs.
Hale--that lady in Crampton, you know--hasn't many weeks to live. I
never had any hope of cure, as I think I told you; but I've been seeing
her to-day, and I think very badly of her.'

Mr. Thornton was silent. The vaunted steadiness of pulse failed him for
an instant.

'Can I do anything, Doctor?' he asked, in an altered voice. 'You
know--you would see, that money is not very plentiful; are there any
comforts or dainties she ought to have?'

'No,' replied the Doctor, shaking his head. 'She craves for fruit,--she
has a constant fever on her; but jargonelle pears will do as well as
anything, and there are quantities of them in the market.'

'You will tell me, if there is anything I can do, I'm sure,' replied Mr.
Thornton. 'I rely upon you.'

'Oh! never fear! I'll not spare your purse,--I know it's deep enough. I
wish you'd give me carte-blanche for all my patients, and all their
wants.'

But Mr. Thornton had no general benevolence,--no universal philanthropy;
few even would have given him credit for strong affections. But he went
straight to the first fruit-shop in Milton, and chose out the bunch of
purple grapes with the most delicate bloom upon them,--the
richest-coloured peaches,--the freshest vine-leaves. They were packed
into a basket, and the shopman awaited the answer to his inquiry, 'Where
shall we send them to, sir?'

There was no reply. 'To Marlborough Mills, I suppose, sir?'

'No!' Mr. Thornton said. 'Give the basket to me,--I'll take it.'

It took up both his hands to carry it; and he had to pass through the
busiest part of the town for feminine shopping. Many a young lady of his
acquaintance turned to look after him, and thought it strange to see him
occupied just like a porter or an errand-boy.

He was thinking, 'I will not be daunted from doing as I choose by the
thought of her. I like to take this fruit to the poor mother, and it is
simply right that I should. She shall never scorn me out of doing what I
please. A pretty joke, indeed, if, for fear of a haughty girl, I failed
in doing a kindness to a man I liked! I do it for Mr. Hale; I do it in
defiance of her.'

He went at an unusual pace, and was soon at Crampton. He went upstairs
two steps at a time, and entered the drawing-room before Dixon could
announce him,--his face flushed, his eyes shining with kindly
earnestness. Mrs. Hale lay on the sofa, heated with fever. Mr. Hale was
reading aloud. Margaret was working on a low stool by her mother's side.
Her heart fluttered, if his did not, at this interview. But he took no
notice of her, hardly of Mr. Hale himself; he went up straight with his
basket to Mrs. Hale, and said, in that subdued and gentle tone, which is
so touching when used by a robust man in full health, speaking to a
feeble invalid--

'I met Dr. Donaldson, ma'am, and as he said fruit would be good for you,
I have taken the liberty--the great liberty of bringing you some that
seemed to me fine.' Mrs. Hale was excessively surprised; excessively
pleased; quite in a tremble of eagerness. Mr. Hale with fewer words
expressed a deeper gratitude.

'Fetch a plate, Margaret--a basket--anything.' Margaret stood up by the
table, half afraid of moving or making any noise to arouse Mr. Thornton
into a consciousness of her being in the room. She thought it would be
awkward for both to be brought into conscious collision; and fancied
that, from her being on a low seat at first, and now standing behind her
father, he had overlooked her in his haste. As if he did not feel the
consciousness of her presence all over, though his eyes had never rested
on her!

'I must go,' said he, 'I cannot stay. If you will forgive this
liberty,--my rough ways,--too abrupt, I fear--but I will be more gentle
next time. You will allow me the pleasure of bringing you some fruit
again, if I should see any that is tempting. Good afternoon, Mr. Hale.
Good-bye, ma'am.'

He was gone. Not one word: not one look to Margaret. She believed that
he had not seen her. She went for a plate in silence, and lifted the
fruit out tenderly, with the points of her delicate taper fingers. It
was good of him to bring it; and after yesterday too!

'Oh! it is so delicious!' said Mrs. Hale, in a feeble voice. 'How kind
of him to think of me! Margaret love, only taste these grapes! Was it
not good of him?'

'Yes!' said Margaret, quietly.

'Margaret!' said Mrs. Hale, rather querulously, 'you won't like anything
Mr. Thornton does. I never saw anybody so prejudiced.'

Mr. Hale had been peeling a peach for his wife; and, cutting off a small
piece for himself, he said:

'If I had any prejudices, the gift of such delicious fruit as this would
melt them all away. I have not tasted such fruit--no! not even in
Hampshire--since I was a boy; and to boys, I fancy, all fruit is good. I
remember eating sloes and crabs with a relish. Do you remember the
matted-up currant bushes, Margaret, at the corner of the west-wall in
the garden at home?'

Did she not? Did she not remember every weather-stain on the old stone
wall; the gray and yellow lichens that marked it like a map; the little
crane's-bill that grew in the crevices? She had been shaken by the
events of the last two days; her whole life just now was a strain upon
her fortitude; and, somehow, these careless words of her father's,
touching on the remembrance of the sunny times of old, made her start
up, and, dropping her sewing on the ground, she went hastily out of the
room into her own little chamber. She had hardly given way to the first
choking sob, when she became aware of Dixon standing at her drawers, and
evidently searching for something.

'Bless me, miss! How you startled me! Missus is not worse, is she? Is
anything the matter?'

'No, nothing. Only I'm silly, Dixon, and want a glass of water. What are
you looking for? I keep my muslins in that drawer.'

Dixon did not speak, but went on rummaging. The scent of lavender came
out and perfumed the room.

At last Dixon found what she wanted; what it was Margaret could not see.
Dixon faced round, and spoke to her:

'Now I don't like telling you what I wanted, because you've fretting
enough to go through, and I know you'll fret about this. I meant to have
kept it from you till night, may be, or such times as that.'

'What is the matter? Pray, tell me, Dixon, at once.'

'That young woman you go to see--Higgins, I mean.'

'Well?'

'Well! she died this morning, and her sister is here--come to beg a
strange thing. It seems, the young woman who died had a fancy for being
buried in something of yours, and so the sister's come to ask for
it,--and I was looking for a night-cap that wasn't too good to give
away.'

'Oh! let me find one,' said Margaret, in the midst of her tears. 'Poor
Bessy! I never thought I should not see her again.'

'Why, that's another thing. This girl down-stairs wanted me to ask you,
if you would like to see her.'

'But she's dead!' said Margaret, turning a little pale. 'I never saw a
dead person. No! I would rather not.'

'I should never have asked you, if you hadn't come in. I told her you
wouldn't.'

'I will go down and speak to her,' said Margaret, afraid lest Dixon's
harshness of manner might wound the poor girl. So, taking the cap in her
hand, she went to the kitchen. Mary's face was all swollen with crying,
and she burst out afresh when she saw Margaret.

'Oh, ma'am, she loved yo', she loved yo', she did indeed!' And for a
long time, Margaret could not get her to say anything more than this. At
last, her sympathy, and Dixon's scolding, forced out a few facts.
Nicholas Higgins had gone out in the morning, leaving Bessy as well as
on the day before. But in an hour she was taken worse; some neighbour
ran to the room where Mary was working; they did not know where to find
her father; Mary had only come in a few minutes before she died.

'It were a day or two ago she axed to be buried in somewhat o' yourn.
She were never tired o' talking o' yo'. She used to say yo' were the
prettiest thing she'd ever clapped eyes on. She loved yo' dearly. Her
last words were, "Give her my affectionate respects; and keep father
fro' drink." Yo'll come and see her, ma'am. She would ha' thought it a
great compliment, I know.'

Margaret shrank a little from answering.

'Yes, perhaps I may. Yes, I will. I'll come before tea. But where's your
father, Mary?'

Mary shook her head, and stood up to be going.

'Miss Hale,' said Dixon, in a low voice, 'where's the use o' your going
to see the poor thing laid out? I'd never say a word against it, if it
could do the girl any good; and I wouldn't mind a bit going myself, if
that would satisfy her. They've just a notion, these common folks, of
its being a respect to the departed. Here,' said she, turning sharply
round, 'I'll come and see your sister. Miss Hale is busy, and she can't
come, or else she would.'

The girl looked wistfully at Margaret. Dixon's coming might be a
compliment, but it was not the same thing to the poor sister, who had
had her little pangs of jealousy, during Bessy's lifetime, at the
intimacy between her and the young lady.

'No, Dixon!' said Margaret with decision. 'I will go. Mary, you shall
see me this afternoon.' And for fear of her own cowardice, she went
away, in order to take from herself any chance of changing her
determination.




CHAPTER XXVIII

COMFORT IN SORROW

    'Through cross to crown!--And though thy spirit's life
     Trials untold assail with giant strength,
     Good cheer! good cheer! Soon ends the bitter strife,
     And thou shalt reign in peace with Christ at length.'
             KOSEGARTEN.

    'Ay sooth, we feel too strong in weal, to need Thee on that road;
     But woe being come, the soul is dumb, that crieth not on "God."'
             MRS. BROWNING.


That afternoon she walked swiftly to the Higgins's house. Mary was
looking out for her, with a half-distrustful face. Margaret smiled into
her eyes to re-assure her. They passed quickly through the house-place,
upstairs, and into the quiet presence of the dead. Then Margaret was
glad that she had come. The face, often so weary with pain, so restless
with troublous thoughts, had now the faint soft smile of eternal rest
upon it. The slow tears gathered into Margaret's eyes, but a deep calm
entered into her soul. And that was death! It looked more peaceful than
life. All beautiful scriptures came into her mind. 'They rest from their
labours.' 'The weary are at rest.' 'He giveth His beloved sleep.'

Slowly, slowly Margaret turned away from the bed. Mary was humbly
sobbing in the back-ground. They went down stairs without a word.

Resting his hand upon the house-table, Nicholas Higgins stood in the
midst of the floor; his great eyes startled open by the news he had
heard, as he came along the court, from many busy tongues. His eyes were
dry and fierce; studying the reality of her death; bringing himself to
understand that her place should know her no more. For she had been
sickly, dying so long, that he had persuaded himself she would not die;
that she would 'pull through.'

Margaret felt as if she had no business to be there, familiarly
acquainting herself with the surroundings of death which he, the father,
had only just learnt. There had been a pause of an instant on the steep
crooked stair, when she first saw him; but now she tried to steal past
his abstracted gaze, and to leave him in the solemn circle of his
household misery.

Mary sat down on the first chair she came to, and throwing her apron
over her head, began to cry.

The noise appeared to rouse him. He took sudden hold of Margaret's arm,
and held her till he could gather words to speak seemed dry; they came
up thick, and choked, and hoarse:

'Were yo' with her? Did yo' see her die?'

'No!' replied Margaret, standing still with the utmost patience, now she
found herself perceived. It was some time before he spoke again, but he
kept his hold on her arm.

'All men must die,' said he at last, with a strange sort of gravity,
which first suggested to Margaret the idea that he had been
drinking--not enough to intoxicate himself, but enough to make his
thoughts bewildered. 'But she were younger than me.' Still he pondered
over the event, not looking at Margaret, though he grasped her tight.
Suddenly, he looked up at her with a wild searching inquiry in his
glance. 'Yo're sure and certain she's dead--not in a dwam, a
faint?--she's been so before, often.'

'She is dead,' replied Margaret. She felt no fear in speaking to him,
though he hurt her arm with his gripe, and wild gleams came across the
stupidity of his eyes.

'She is dead!' she said.

He looked at her still with that searching look, which seemed to fade
out of his eyes as he gazed. Then he suddenly let go his hold of
Margaret, and, throwing his body half across the table, he shook it and
every piece of furniture in the room, with his violent sobs. Mary came
trembling towards him.

'Get thee gone!--get thee gone!' he cried, striking wildly and blindly
at her. 'What do I care for thee?' Margaret took her hand, and held it
softly in hers. He tore his hair, he beat his head against the hard
wood, then he lay exhausted and stupid. Still his daughter and Margaret
did not move. Mary trembled from head to foot.

At last--it might have been a quarter of an hour, it might have been an
hour--he lifted himself up. His eyes were swollen and bloodshot, and he
seemed to have forgotten that any one was by; he scowled at the watchers
when he saw them. He shook himself heavily, gave them one more sullen
look, spoke never a word, but made for the door.

'Oh, father, father!' said Mary, throwing herself upon his arm,--'not
to-night! Any night but to-night. Oh, help me! he's going out to drink
again! Father, I'll not leave yo'. Yo' may strike, but I'll not leave
yo'. She told me last of all to keep yo' fro' drink!'

But Margaret stood in the doorway, silent yet commanding. He looked up
at her defyingly.

'It's my own house. Stand out o' the way, wench, or I'll make yo'!' He
had shaken off Mary with violence; he looked ready to strike Margaret.
But she never moved a feature--never took her deep, serious eyes off
him. He stared back on her with gloomy fierceness. If she had stirred
hand or foot, he would have thrust her aside with even more violence
than he had used to his own daughter, whose face was bleeding from her
fall against a chair.

'What are yo' looking at me in that way for?' asked he at last, daunted
and awed by her severe calm. 'If yo' think for to keep me from going
what gait I choose, because she loved yo'--and in my own house, too,
where I never asked yo' to come, yo're mista'en. It's very hard upon a
man that he can't go to the only comfort left.'

Margaret felt that he acknowledged her power. What could she do next? He
had seated himself on a chair, close to the door; half-conquered,
half-resenting; intending to go out as soon as she left her position,
but unwilling to use the violence he had threatened not five minutes
before. Margaret laid her hand on his arm.

'Come with me,' she said. 'Come and see her!'

The voice in which she spoke was very low and solemn; but there was no
fear or doubt expressed in it, either of him or of his compliance. He
sullenly rose up. He stood uncertain, with dogged irresolution upon his
face. She waited him there; quietly and patiently waited for his time to
move. He had a strange pleasure in making her wait; but at last he moved
towards the stairs.

She and he stood by the corpse.

'Her last words to Mary were, "Keep my father fro' drink."'

'It canna hurt her now,' muttered he. 'Nought can hurt her now.' Then,
raising his voice to a wailing cry, he went on: 'We may quarrel and fall
out--we may make peace and be friends--we may clem to skin and bone--and
nought o' all our griefs will ever touch her more. Hoo's had her portion
on 'em. What wi' hard work first, and sickness at last, hoo's led the
life of a dog. And to die without knowing one good piece o' rejoicing in
all her days! Nay, wench, whatever hoo said, hoo can know nought about
it now, and I mun ha' a sup o' drink just to steady me again sorrow.'

'No,' said Margaret, softening with his softened manner. 'You shall not.
If her life has been what you say, at any rate she did not fear death as
some do. Oh, you should have heard her speak of the life to come--the
life hidden with God, that she is now gone to.'

He shook his head, glancing sideways up at Margaret as he did so. His
pale, haggard face struck her painfully.

'You are sorely tired. Where have you been all day--not at work?'

'Not at work, sure enough,' said he, with a short, grim laugh. 'Not at
what you call work. I were at the Committee, till I were sickened out
wi' trying to make fools hear reason. I were fetched to Boucher's wife
afore seven this morning. She's bed-fast, but she were raving and raging
to know where her dunder-headed brute of a chap was, as if I'd to keep
him--as if he were fit to be ruled by me. The d---- d fool, who has put
his foot in all our plans! And I've walked my feet sore wi' going about
for to see men who wouldn't be seen, now the law is raised again us. And
I were sore-hearted, too, which is worse than sore-footed; and if I did
see a friend who ossed to treat me, I never knew hoo lay a-dying here.
Bess, lass, thou'd believe me, thou wouldst--wouldstn't thou?' turning
to the poor dumb form with wild appeal.

'I am sure,' said Margaret, 'I am sure you did not know: it was quite
sudden. But now, you see, it would be different; you do know; you do see
her lying there; you hear what she said with her last breath. You will
not go?'

No answer. In fact, where was he to look for comfort?

'Come home with me,' said she at last, with a bold venture, half
trembling at her own proposal as she made it. 'At least you shall have
some comfortable food, which I'm sure you need.'

'Yo'r father's a parson?' asked he, with a sudden turn in his ideas.

'He was,' said Margaret, shortly.

'I'll go and take a dish o' tea with him, since yo've asked me. I've
many a thing I often wished to say to a parson, and I'm not particular
as to whether he's preaching now, or not.'

Margaret was perplexed; his drinking tea with her father, who would be
totally unprepared for his visitor--her mother so ill--seemed utterly
out of the question; and yet if she drew back now, it would be worse
than ever--sure to drive him to the gin-shop. She thought that if she
could only get him to their own house, it was so great a step gained
that she would trust to the chapter of accidents for the next.

'Goodbye, ou'd wench! We've parted company at last, we have! But thou'st
been a blessin' to thy father ever sin' thou wert born. Bless thy white
lips, lass,--they've a smile on 'em now! and I'm glad to see it once
again, though I'm lone and forlorn for evermore.'

He stooped down and fondly kissed his daughter; covered up her face, and
turned to follow Margaret. She had hastily gone down stairs to tell Mary
of the arrangement; to say it was the only way she could think of to
keep him from the gin-palace; to urge Mary to come too, for her heart
smote her at the idea of leaving the poor affectionate girl alone. But
Mary had friends among the neighbours, she said, who would come in and
sit a bit with her, it was all right; but father--

He was there by them as she would have spoken more. He had shaken off
his emotion, as if he was ashamed of having ever given way to it; and
had even o'erleaped himself so much that he assumed a sort of bitter
mirth, like the crackling of thorns under a pot.

'I'm going to take my tea wi' her father, I am!'

But he slouched his cap low down over his brow as he went out into the
street, and looked neither to the right nor to the left, while he
tramped along by Margaret's side; he feared being upset by the words,
still more the looks, of sympathising neighbours. So he and Margaret
walked in silence.

As he got near the street in which he knew she lived, he looked down at
his clothes, his hands, and shoes.

'I should m'appen ha' cleaned mysel', first?'

It certainly would have been desirable, but Margaret assured him he
should be allowed to go into the yard, and have soap and towel provided;
she could not let him slip out of her hands just then.

While he followed the house-servant along the passage, and through the
kitchen, stepping cautiously on every dark mark in the pattern of the
oil-cloth, in order to conceal his dirty foot-prints, Margaret ran
upstairs. She met Dixon on the landing.

'How is mamma?--where is papa?'

Missus was tired, and gone into her own room. She had wanted to go to
bed, but Dixon had persuaded her to lie down on the sofa, and have her
tea brought to her there; it would be better than getting restless by
being too long in bed.

So far, so good. But where was Mr. Hale? In the drawing-room. Margaret
went in half breathless with the hurried story she had to tell. Of
course, she told it incompletely; and her father was rather 'taken
aback' by the idea of the drunken weaver awaiting him in his quiet
study, with whom he was expected to drink tea, and on whose behalf
Margaret was anxiously pleading. The meek, kind-hearted Mr. Hale would
have readily tried to console him in his grief, but, unluckily, the
point Margaret dwelt upon most forcibly was the fact of his having been
drinking, and her having brought him home with her as a last expedient
to keep him from the gin-shop. One little event had come out of another
so naturally that Margaret was hardly conscious of what she had done,
till she saw the slight look of repugnance on her father's face.

'Oh, papa! he really is a man you will not dislike--if you won't be
shocked to begin with.'

'But, Margaret, to bring a drunken man home--and your mother so ill!'

Margaret's countenance fell. 'I am sorry, papa. He is very quiet--he is
not tipsy at all. He was only rather strange at first, but that might be
the shock of poor Bessy's death.' Margaret's eyes filled with tears. Mr.
Hale took hold of her sweet pleading face in both his hands, and kissed
her forehead.

'It is all right, dear. I'll go and make him as comfortable as I can,
and do you attend to your mother. Only, if you can come in and make a
third in the study, I shall be glad.'

'Oh, yes--thank you.' But as Mr. Hale was leaving the room, she ran
after him:

'Papa--you must not wonder at what he says: he's an---- I mean he does
not believe in much of what we do.'

'Oh dear! a drunken infidel weaver!' said Mr. Hale to himself, in
dismay. But to Margaret he only said, 'If your mother goes to sleep, be
sure you come directly.'

Margaret went into her mother's room. Mrs. Hale lifted herself up from a
doze.

'When did you write to Frederick, Margaret? Yesterday, or the day
before?'

'Yesterday, mamma.'

'Yesterday. And the letter went?'

'Yes. I took it myself'

'Oh, Margaret, I'm so afraid of his coming! If he should be recognised!
If he should be taken! If he should be executed, after all these years
that he has kept away and lived in safety! I keep falling asleep and
dreaming that he is caught and being tried.'

'Oh, mamma, don't be afraid. There will be some risk no doubt; but we
will lessen it as much as ever we can. And it is so little! Now, if we
were at Helstone, there would be twenty--a hundred times as much. There,
everybody would remember him and if there was a stranger known to be in
the house, they would be sure to guess it was Frederick; while here,
nobody knows or cares for us enough to notice what we do. Dixon will
keep the door like a dragon--won't you, Dixon--while he is here?'

'They'll be clever if they come in past me!' said Dixon, showing her
teeth at the bare idea.

'And he need not go out, except in the dusk, poor fellow!'

'Poor fellow!' echoed Mrs. Hale. 'But I almost wish you had not written.
Would it be too late to stop him if you wrote again, Margaret?'

'I'm afraid it would, mamma,' said Margaret, remembering the urgency
with which she had entreated him to come directly, if he wished to see
his mother alive.

'I always dislike that doing things in such a hurry,' said Mrs. Hale.

Margaret was silent.

'Come now, ma'am,' said Dixon, with a kind of cheerful authority, 'you
know seeing Master Frederick is just the very thing of all others you're
longing for. And I'm glad Miss Margaret wrote off straight, without
shilly-shallying. I've had a great mind to do it myself. And we'll keep
him snug, depend upon it. There's only Martha in the house that would
not do a good deal to save him on a pinch; and I've been thinking she
might go and see her mother just at that very time. She's been saying
once or twice she should like to go, for her mother has had a stroke
since she came here, only she didn't like to ask. But I'll see about her
being safe off, as soon as we know when he comes, God bless him! So take
your tea, ma'am, in comfort, and trust to me.'

Mrs. Hale did trust in Dixon more than in Margaret. Dixon's words
quieted her for the time. Margaret poured out the tea in silence, trying
to think of something agreeable to say; but her thoughts made answer
something like Daniel O'Rourke, when the man-in-the-moon asked him to
get off his reaping-hook. 'The more you ax us, the more we won't stir.'
The more she tried to think of something anything besides the danger to
which Frederick would be exposed--the more closely her imagination clung
to the unfortunate idea presented to her. Her mother prattled with
Dixon, and seemed to have utterly forgotten the possibility of Frederick
being tried and executed--utterly forgotten that at her wish, if by
Margaret's deed, he was summoned into this danger. Her mother was one of
those who throw out terrible possibilities, miserable probabilities,
unfortunate chances of all kinds, as a rocket throws out sparks; but if
the sparks light on some combustible matter, they smoulder first, and
burst out into a frightful flame at last. Margaret was glad when, her
filial duties gently and carefully performed, she could go down into the
study. She wondered how her father and Higgins had got on.

In the first place, the decorous, kind-hearted, simple, old-fashioned
gentleman, had unconsciously called out, by his own refinement and
courteousness of manner, all the latent courtesy in the other.

Mr. Hale treated all his fellow-creatures alike: it never entered into
his head to make any difference because of their rank. He placed a chair
for Nicholas stood up till he, at Mr. Hale's request, took a seat; and
called him, invariably, 'Mr. Higgins,' instead of the curt 'Nicholas' or
'Higgins,' to which the 'drunken infidel weaver' had been accustomed.
But Nicholas was neither an habitual drunkard nor a thorough infidel. He
drank to drown care, as he would have himself expressed it: and he was
infidel so far as he had never yet found any form of faith to which he
could attach himself, heart and soul.

Margaret was a little surprised, and very much pleased, when she found
her father and Higgins in earnest conversation--each speaking with
gentle politeness to the other, however their opinions might clash.
Nicholas--clean, tidied (if only at the pump-trough), and quiet
spoken--was a new creature to her, who had only seen him in the rough
independence of his own hearthstone. He had 'slicked' his hair down with
the fresh water; he had adjusted his neck-handkerchief, and borrowed an
odd candle-end to polish his clogs with and there he sat, enforcing some
opinion on her father, with a strong Darkshire accent, it is true, but
with a lowered voice, and a good, earnest composure on his face. Her
father, too, was interested in what his companion was saying. He looked
round as she came in, smiled, and quietly gave her his chair, and then
sat down afresh as quickly as possible, and with a little bow of apology
to his guest for the interruption. Higgins nodded to her as a sign of
greeting; and she softly adjusted her working materials on the table,
and prepared to listen.

'As I was a-sayin, sir, I reckon yo'd not ha' much belief in yo' if yo'
lived here,--if yo'd been bred here. I ax your pardon if I use wrong
words; but what I mean by belief just now, is a-thinking on sayings and
maxims and promises made by folk yo' never saw, about the things and the
life, yo' never saw, nor no one else. Now, yo' say these are true
things, and true sayings, and a true life. I just say, where's the
proof? There's many and many a one wiser, and scores better learned than
I am around me,--folk who've had time to think on these things,--while
my time has had to be gi'en up to getting my bread. Well, I sees these
people. Their lives is pretty much open to me. They're real folk. They
don't believe i' the Bible,--not they. They may say they do, for form's
sake; but Lord, sir, d'ye think their first cry i' th' morning is, "What
shall I do to get hold on eternal life?" or "What shall I do to fill my
purse this blessed day? Where shall I go? What bargains shall I strike?"
The purse and the gold and the notes is real things; things as can be
felt and touched; them's realities; and eternal life is all a talk, very
fit for--I ax your pardon, sir; yo'r a parson out o' work, I believe.
Well! I'll never speak disrespectful of a man in the same fix as I'm in
mysel'. But I'll just ax yo another question, sir, and I dunnot want yo
to answer it, only to put in yo'r pipe, and smoke it, afore yo' go for
to set down us, who only believe in what we see, as fools and noddies.
If salvation, and life to come, and what not, was true--not in men's
words, but in men's hearts' core--dun yo' not think they'd din us wi' it
as they do wi' political 'conomy? They're mighty anxious to come round
us wi' that piece o' wisdom; but t'other would be a greater convarsion,
if it were true.'

'But the masters have nothing to do with your religion. All that they
are connected with you in is trade,--so they think,--and all that it
concerns them, therefore, to rectify your opinions in is the science of
trade.'

'I'm glad, sir,' said Higgins, with a curious wink of his eye, 'that yo'
put in, "so they think." I'd ha' thought yo' a hypocrite, I'm afeard, if
yo' hadn't, for all yo'r a parson, or rayther because yo'r a parson. Yo'
see, if yo'd spoken o' religion as a thing that, if it was true, it
didn't concern all men to press on all men's attention, above everything
else in this 'varsal earth, I should ha' thought yo' a knave for to be a
parson; and I'd rather think yo' a fool than a knave. No offence, I
hope, sir.'

'None at all. You consider me mistaken, and I consider you far more
fatally mistaken. I don't expect to convince you in a day,--not in one
conversation; but let us know each other, and speak freely to each other
about these things, and the truth will prevail. I should not believe in
God if I did not believe that. Mr. Higgins, I trust, whatever else you
have given up, you believe'--(Mr. Hale's voice dropped low in
reverence)--'you believe in Him.'

Nicholas Higgins suddenly stood straight, stiff up. Margaret started to
her feet,--for she thought, by the working of his face, he was going
into convulsions. Mr. Hale looked at her dismayed. At last Higgins found
words:

'Man! I could fell yo' to the ground for tempting me. Whatten business
have yo' to try me wi' your doubts? Think o' her lying theere, after the
life hoo's led and think then how yo'd deny me the one sole comfort
left--that there is a God, and that He set her her life. I dunnot
believe she'll ever live again,' said he, sitting down, and drearily
going on, as if to the unsympathising fire. 'I dunnot believe in any
other life than this, in which she dreed such trouble, and had such
never-ending care; and I cannot bear to think it were all a set o'
chances, that might ha' been altered wi' a breath o' wind. There's many
a time when I've thought I didna believe in God, but I've never put it
fair out before me in words, as many men do. I may ha' laughed at those
who did, to brave it out like--but I have looked round at after, to see
if He heard me, if so be there was a He; but to-day, when I'm left
desolate, I wunnot listen to yo' wi' yo'r questions, and yo'r doubts.
There's but one thing steady and quiet i' all this reeling world, and,
reason or no reason, I'll cling to that. It's a' very well for happy
folk'----

Margaret touched his arm very softly. She had not spoken before, nor had
he heard her rise.

'Nicholas, we do not want to reason; you misunderstand my father. We do
not reason--we believe; and so do you. It is the one sole comfort in
such times.'

He turned round and caught her hand. 'Ay! it is, it is--(brushing away
the tears with the back of his hand).--'But yo' know, she's lying dead
at home and I'm welly dazed wi' sorrow, and at times I hardly know what
I'm saying. It's as if speeches folk ha' made--clever and smart things
as I've thought at the time--come up now my heart's welly brossen. Th'
strike's failed as well; dun yo' know that, miss? I were coming whoam to
ask her, like a beggar as I am, for a bit o' comfort i' that trouble;
and I were knocked down by one who telled me she were dead--just dead.
That were all; but that were enough for me.

Mr. Hale blew his nose, and got up to snuff the candles in order to
conceal his emotion. 'He's not an infidel, Margaret; how could you say
so?' muttered he reproachfully 'I've a good mind to read him the
fourteenth chapter of Job.'

'Not yet, papa, I think. Perhaps not at all. Let us ask him about the
strike, and give him all the sympathy he needs, and hoped to have from
poor Bessy.'

So they questioned and listened. The workmen's calculations were based
(like too many of the masters') on false premises. They reckoned on
their fellow-men as if they possessed the calculable powers of machines,
no more, no less; no allowance for human passions getting the better of
reason, as in the case of Boucher and the rioters; and believing that
the representations of their injuries would have the same effect on
strangers far away, as the injuries (fancied or real) had upon
themselves. They were consequently surprised and indignant at the poor
Irish, who had allowed themselves to be imported and brought over to
take their places. This indignation was tempered, in some degree, by
contempt for 'them Irishers,' and by pleasure at the idea of the
bungling way in which they would set to work, and perplex their new
masters with their ignorance and stupidity, strange exaggerated stories
of which were already spreading through the town. But the most cruel cut
of all was that of the Milton workmen, who had defied and disobeyed the
commands of the Union to keep the peace, whatever came; who had
originated discord in the camp, and spread the panic of the law being
arrayed against them.

'And so the strike is at an end,' said Margaret.

'Ay, miss. It's save as save can. Th' factory doors will need open wide
to-morrow to let in all who'll be axing for work; if it's only just to
show they'd nought to do wi' a measure, which if we'd been made o' th'
right stuff would ha' brought wages up to a point they'n not been at
this ten year.'

'You'll get work, shan't you?' asked Margaret. 'You're a famous workman,
are not you?'

'Hamper'll let me work at his mill, when he cuts off his right hand--not
before, and not after,' said Nicholas, quietly. Margaret was silenced
and sad.

'About the wages,' said Mr. Hale. 'You'll not be offended, but I think
you make some sad mistakes. I should like to read you some remarks in a
book I have.' He got up and went to his book-shelves.

'Yo' needn't trouble yoursel', sir,' said Nicholas. 'Their book-stuff
goes in at one ear and out at t'other. I can make nought on't. Afore
Hamper and me had this split, th' overlooker telled him I were stirring
up the men to ask for higher wages; and Hamper met me one day in th'
yard. He'd a thin book i' his hand, and says he, "Higgins, I'm told
you're one of those damned fools that think you can get higher wages for
asking for 'em; ay, and keep 'em up too, when you've forced 'em up. Now,
I'll give yo' a chance and try if yo've any sense in yo'. Here's a book
written by a friend o' mine, and if yo'll read it yo'll see how wages
find their own level, without either masters or men having aught to do
with them; except the men cut their own throats wi' striking, like the
confounded noodles they are." Well, now, sir, I put it to yo', being a
parson, and having been in th' preaching line, and having had to try and
bring folk o'er to what yo' thought was a right way o' thinking--did yo'
begin by calling 'em fools and such like, or didn't yo' rayther give 'em
some kind words at first, to make 'em ready for to listen and be
convinced, if they could; and in yo'r preaching, did yo' stop every now
and then, and say, half to them and half to yo'rsel', "But yo're such a
pack o' fools, that I've a strong notion it's no use my trying to put
sense into yo'?" I were not i' th' best state, I'll own, for taking in
what Hamper's friend had to say--I were so vexed at the way it were put
to me;--but I thought, "Come, I'll see what these chaps has got to say,
and try if it's them or me as is th' noodle." So I took th' book and
tugged at it; but, Lord bless yo', it went on about capital and labour,
and labour and capital, till it fair sent me off to sleep. I ne'er could
rightly fix i' my mind which was which; and it spoke on 'em as if they
was vartues or vices; and what I wanted for to know were the rights o'
men, whether they were rich or poor--so be they only were men.'

'But for all that,' said Mr. Hale, 'and granting to the full the
offensiveness, the folly, the unchristianness of Mr. Hamper's way of
speaking to you in recommending his friend's book, yet if it told you
what he said it did, that wages find their own level, and that the most
successful strike can only force them up for a moment, to sink in far
greater proportion afterwards, in consequence of that very strike, the
book would have told you the truth.'

'Well, sir,' said Higgins, rather doggedly; 'it might, or it might not.
There's two opinions go to settling that point. But suppose it was truth
double strong, it were no truth to me if I couldna take it in. I daresay
there's truth in yon Latin book on your shelves; but it's gibberish and
not truth to me, unless I know the meaning o' the words. If yo', sir, or
any other knowledgable, patient man come to me, and says he'll larn me
what the words mean, and not blow me up if I'm a bit stupid, or forget
how one thing hangs on another--why, in time I may get to see the truth
of it; or I may not. I'll not be bound to say I shall end in thinking
the same as any man. And I'm not one who think truth can be shaped out
in words, all neat and clean, as th' men at th' foundry cut out
sheet-iron. Same bones won't go down wi' every one. It'll stick here i'
this man's throat, and there i' t'other's. Let alone that, when down, it
may be too strong for this one, too weak for that. Folk who sets up to
doctor th' world wi' their truth, mun suit different for different
minds; and be a bit tender in th' way of giving it too, or th' poor sick
fools may spit it out i' their faces. Now Hamper first gi'es me a box on
my ear, and then he throws his big bolus at me, and says he reckons
it'll do me no good, I'm such a fool, but there it is.'

'I wish some of the kindest and wisest of the masters would meet some of
you men, and have a good talk on these things; it would, surely, be the
best way of getting over your difficulties, which, I do believe, arise
from your ignorance--excuse me, Mr. Higgins--on subjects which it is for
the mutual interest of both masters and men should be well understood by
both. I wonder'--(half to his daughter), 'if Mr. Thornton might not be
induced to do such a thing?'

'Remember, papa,' said she in a very low voice, 'what he said one
day--about governments, you know.' She was unwilling to make any clearer
allusion to the conversation they had held on the mode of governing
work-people--by giving men intelligence enough to rule themselves, or by
a wise despotism on the part of the master--for she saw that Higgins had
caught Mr. Thornton's name, if not the whole of the speech: indeed, he
began to speak of him.

'Thornton! He's the chap as wrote off at once for these Irishers; and
led to th' riot that ruined th' strike. Even Hamper wi' all his
bullying, would ha' waited a while--but it's a word and a blow wi'
Thornton. And, now, when th' Union would ha' thanked him for following
up th' chase after Boucher, and them chaps as went right again our
commands, it's Thornton who steps forrard and coolly says that, as th'
strike's at an end, he, as party injured, doesn't want to press the
charge again the rioters. I thought he'd had more pluck. I thought he'd
ha' carried his point, and had his revenge in an open way; but says he
(one in court telled me his very words) "they are well known; they will
find the natural punishment of their conduct, in the difficulty they
will meet wi' in getting employment. That will be severe enough." I only
wish they'd cotched Boucher, and had him up before Hamper. I see th' oud
tiger setting on him! would he ha' let him off? Not he!'

'Mr. Thornton was right,' said Margaret. You are angry against Boucher,
Nicholas; or else you would be the first to see, that where the natural
punishment would be severe enough for the offence, any farther
punishment would be something like revenge.

'My daughter is no great friend of Mr. Thornton's,' said Mr. Hale,
smiling at Margaret; while she, as red as any carnation, began to work
with double diligence, 'but I believe what she says is the truth. I like
him for it.'

'Well, sir, this strike has been a weary piece o' business to me; and
yo'll not wonder if I'm a bit put out wi' seeing it fail, just for a few
men who would na suffer in silence, and hou'd out, brave and firm.'

'You forget!' said Margaret. 'I don't know much of Boucher; but the only
time I saw him it was not his own sufferings he spoke of, but those of
his sick wife--his little children.'

'True! but he were not made of iron himsel'. He'd ha' cried out for his
own sorrows, next. He were not one to bear.'

'How came he into the Union?' asked Margaret innocently. 'You don't seem
to have much respect for him; nor gained much good from having him in.'

Higgins's brow clouded. He was silent for a minute or two. Then he said,
shortly enough:

'It's not for me to speak o' th' Union. What they does, they does. Them
that is of a trade mun hang together; and if they're not willing to take
their chance along wi' th' rest, th' Union has ways and means.'

Mr. Hale saw that Higgins was vexed at the turn the conversation had
taken, and was silent. Not so Margaret, though she saw Higgins's feeling
as clearly as he did. By instinct she felt, that if he could but be
brought to express himself in plain words, something clear would be
gained on which to argue for the right and the just.

'And what are the Union's ways and means?'

He looked up at her, as if on' the point of dogged resistance to her
wish for information. But her calm face, fixed on his, patient and
trustful, compelled him to answer.

'Well! If a man doesn't belong to th' Union, them as works next looms
has orders not to speak to him--if he's sorry or ill it's a' the same;
he's out o' bounds; he's none o' us; he comes among us, he works among
us, but he's none o' us. I' some places them's fined who speaks to him.
Yo' try that, miss; try living a year or two among them as looks away if
yo' look at 'em; try working within two yards o' crowds o' men, who, yo'
know, have a grinding grudge at yo' in their hearts--to whom if yo' say
yo'r glad, not an eye brightens, nor a lip moves,--to whom if your
heart's heavy, yo' can never say nought, because they'll ne'er take
notice on your sighs or sad looks (and a man 's no man who'll groan out
loud 'bout folk asking him what 's the matter?)--just yo' try that,
miss--ten hours for three hundred days, and yo'll know a bit what th'
Union is.'

'Why!' said Margaret, 'what tyranny this is! Nay, Higgins, I don't care
one straw for your anger. I know you can't be angry with me if you
would, and I must tell you the truth: that I never read, in all the
history I have read, of a more slow, lingering torture than this. And
you belong to the Union! And you talk of the tyranny of the masters!'

'Nay,' said Higgins, 'yo' may say what yo' like! The dead stand between
yo and every angry word o' mine. D' ye think I forget who's lying
_there_, and how hoo loved yo'? And it's th' masters as has made us sin,
if th' Union is a sin. Not this generation maybe, but their fathers.
Their fathers ground our fathers to the very dust; ground us to powder!
Parson! I reckon, I've heerd my mother read out a text, "The fathers
have eaten sour grapes and th' children's teeth are set on edge." It's
so wi' them. In those days of sore oppression th' Unions began; it were
a necessity. It's a necessity now, according to me. It's a withstanding
of injustice, past, present, or to come. It may be like war; along wi'
it come crimes; but I think it were a greater crime to let it alone. Our
only chance is binding men together in one common interest; and if some
are cowards and some are fools, they mun come along and join the great
march, whose only strength is in numbers.'

'Oh!' said Mr. Hale, sighing, 'your Union in itself would be beautiful,
glorious,--it would be Christianity itself--if it were but for an end
which affected the good of all, instead of that of merely one class as
opposed to another.'

'I reckon it's time for me to be going, sir,' said Higgins, as the clock
struck ten.

'Home?' said Margaret very softly. He understood her, and took her
offered hand. 'Home, miss. Yo' may trust me, tho' I am one o' th'
Union.'

'I do trust you most thoroughly, Nicholas.'

'Stay!' said Mr. Hale, hurrying to the book-shelves. 'Mr. Higgins! I'm
sure you'll join us in family prayer?'

Higgins looked at Margaret, doubtfully. Her grave sweet eyes met his;
there was no compulsion, only deep interest in them. He did not speak,
but he kept his place.

Margaret the Churchwoman, her father the Dissenter, Higgins the Infidel,
knelt down together. It did them no harm.




CHAPTER XXIX

A RAY OF SUNSHINE

    'Some wishes crossed my mind and dimly cheered it,
     And one or two poor melancholy pleasures,
     Each in the pale unwarming light of hope,
     Silvering its flimsy wing, flew silent by--
     Moths in the moonbeam!'
             COLERIDGE.


The next morning brought Margaret a letter from Edith. It was
affectionate and inconsequent like the writer. But the affection was
charming to Margaret's own affectionate nature; and she had grown up
with the inconsequence, so she did not perceive it. It was as follows:--

'Oh, Margaret, it is worth a journey from England to see my boy! He is a
superb little fellow, especially in his caps, and most especially in the
one you sent him, you good, dainty-fingered, persevering little lady!
Having made all the mothers here envious, I want to show him to somebody
new, and hear a fresh set of admiring expressions; perhaps, that's all
the reason; perhaps it is not--nay, possibly, there is just a little
cousinly love mixed with it; but I do want you so much to come here,
Margaret! I'm sure it would be the very best thing for Aunt Hale's
health; everybody here is young and well, and our skies are always blue,
and our sun always shines, and the band plays deliciously from morning
till night; and, to come back to the burden of my ditty, my baby always
smiles. I am constantly wanting you to draw him for me, Margaret. It
does not signify what he is doing; that very thing is prettiest,
gracefulest, best. I think I love him a great deal better than my
husband, who is getting stout, and grumpy,--what he calls "busy." No! he
is not. He has just come in with news of such a charming pic-nic, given
by the officers of the Hazard, at anchor in the bay below. Because he
has brought in such a pleasant piece of news, I retract all I said just
now. Did not somebody burn his hand for having said or done something he
was sorry for? Well, I can't burn mine, because it would hurt me, and
the scar would be ugly; but I'll retract all I said as fast as I can.
Cosmo is quite as great a darling as baby, and not a bit stout, and as
un-grumpy as ever husband was; only, sometimes he is very, very busy. I
may say that without love--wifely duty--where was I?--I had something
very particular to say, I know, once. Oh, it is this--Dearest
Margaret!--you must come and see me; it would do Aunt Hale good, as I
said before. Get the doctor to order it for her. Tell him that it's the
smoke of Milton that does her harm. I have no doubt it is that, really.
Three months (you must not come for less) of this delicious climate--all
sunshine, and grapes as common as blackberries, would quite cure her. I
don't ask my uncle'--(Here the letter became more constrained, and
better written; Mr. Hale was in the corner, like a naughty child, for
having given up his living.)--'because, I dare say, he disapproves of
war, and soldiers, and bands of music; at least, I know that many
Dissenters are members of the Peace Society, and I am afraid he would
not like to come; but, if he would, dear, pray say that Cosmo and I will
do our best to make him happy; and I'll hide up Cosmo's red coat and
sword, and make the band play all sorts of grave, solemn things; or, if
they do play pomps and vanities, it shall be in double slow time. Dear
Margaret, if he would like to accompany you and Aunt Hale, we will try
and make it pleasant, though I'm rather afraid of any one who has done
something for conscience sake. You never did, I hope. Tell Aunt Hale not
to bring many warm clothes, though I'm afraid it will be late in the
year before you can come. But you have no idea of the heat here! I tried
to wear my great beauty Indian shawl at a pic-nic. I kept myself up with
proverbs as long as I could; "Pride must abide,"--and such wholesome
pieces of pith; but it was of no use. I was like mamma's little dog Tiny
with an elephant's trappings on; smothered, hidden, killed with my
finery; so I made it into a capital carpet for us all to sit down upon.
Here's this boy of mine, Margaret,--if you don't pack up your things as
soon as you get this letter, a come straight off to see him, I shall
think you're descended from King Herod!'

Margaret did long for a day of Edith's life--her freedom from care, her
cheerful home, her sunny skies. If a wish could have transported her,
she would have gone off; just for one day. She yearned for the strength
which such a change would give,--even for a few hours to be in the midst
of that bright life, and to feel young again. Not yet twenty! and she
had had to bear up against such hard pressure that she felt quite old.
That was her first feeling after reading Edith's letter. Then she read
it again, and, forgetting herself, was amused at its likeness to Edith's
self, and was laughing merrily over it when Mrs. Hale came into the
drawing-room, leaning on Dixon's arm. Margaret flew to adjust the
pillows. Her mother seemed more than usually feeble.

'What were you laughing at, Margaret?' asked she, as soon as she had
recovered from the exertion of settling herself on the sofa.

'A letter I have had this morning from Edith. Shall I read it you,
mamma?'

She read it aloud, and for a time it seemed to interest her mother, who
kept wondering what name Edith had given to her boy, and suggesting all
probable names, and all possible reasons why each and all of these names
should be given. Into the very midst of these wonders Mr. Thornton came,
bringing another offering of fruit for Mrs. Hale. He could not--say
rather, he would not--deny himself the chance of the pleasure of seeing
Margaret. He had no end in this but the present gratification. It was
the sturdy wilfulness of a man usually most reasonable and
self-controlled. He entered the room, taking in at a glance the fact of
Margaret's presence; but after the first cold distant bow, he never
seemed to let his eyes fall on her again. He only stayed to present his
peaches--to speak some gentle kindly words--and then his cold offended
eyes met Margaret's with a grave farewell, as he left the room. She sat
down silent and pale.

'Do you know, Margaret, I really begin quite to like Mr. Thornton.'

No answer at first. Then Margaret forced out an icy 'Do you?'

'Yes! I think he is really getting quite polished in his manners.'

Margaret's voice was more in order now. She replied,

'He is very kind and attentive,--there is no doubt of that.'

'I wonder Mrs. Thornton never calls. She must know I am ill, because of
the water-bed.'

'I dare say, she hears how you are from her son.'

'Still, I should like to see her. You have so few friends here,
Margaret.'

Margaret felt what was in her mother's thoughts,--a tender craving to
bespeak the kindness of some woman towards the daughter that might be so
soon left motherless. But she could not speak.

'Do you think,' said Mrs. Hale, after a pause, 'that you could go and
ask Mrs. Thornton to come and see me? Only once,--I don't want to be
troublesome.'

'I will do anything, if you wish it, mamma,--but if--but when Frederick
comes---- '

'Ah, to be sure! we must keep our doors shut,--we must let no one in. I
hardly know whether I dare wish him to come or not. Sometimes I think I
would rather not. Sometimes I have such frightful dreams about him.'

'Oh, mamma! we'll take good care. I will put my arm in the bolt sooner
than he should come to the slightest harm. Trust the care of him to me,
mamma. I will watch over him like a lioness over her young.'

'When can we hear from him?'

'Not for a week yet, certainly,--perhaps more.'

'We must send Martha away in good time. It would never do to have her
here when he comes, and then send her off in a hurry.'

'Dixon is sure to remind us of that. I was thinking that, if we wanted
any help in the house while he is here, we could perhaps get Mary
Higgins. She is very slack of work, and is a good girl, and would take
pains to do her best, I am sure, and would sleep at home, and need never
come upstairs, so as to know who is in the house.'

'As you please. As Dixon pleases. But, Margaret, don't get to use these
horrid Milton words. "Slack of work:" it is a provincialism. What will
your aunt Shaw say, if she hears you use it on her return?'

'Oh, mamma! don't try and make a bugbear of aunt Shaw' said Margaret,
laughing. 'Edith picked up all sorts of military slang from Captain
Lennox, and aunt Shaw never took any notice of it.'

'But yours is factory slang.'

'And if I live in a factory town, I must speak factory language when I
want it. Why, mamma, I could astonish you with a great many words you
never heard in your life. I don't believe you know what a knobstick is.'

'Not I, child. I only know it has a very vulgar sound and I don't want
to hear you using it.'

'Very well, dearest mother, I won't. Only I shall have to use a whole
explanatory sentence instead.'

'I don't like this Milton,' said Mrs. Hale. 'Edith is right enough in
saying it's the smoke that has made me so ill.'

Margaret started up as her mother said this. Her father had just entered
the room, and she was most anxious that the faint impression she had
seen on his mind that the Milton air had injured her mother's health,
should not be deepened,--should not receive any confirmation. She could
not tell whether he had heard what Mrs. Hale had said or not; but she
began speaking hurriedly of other things, unaware that Mr. Thornton was
following him.

'Mamma is accusing me of having picked up a great deal of vulgarity
since we came to Milton.'

The 'vulgarity' Margaret spoke of, referred purely to the use of local
words, and the expression arose out of the conversation they had just
been holding. But Mr. Thornton's brow darkened; and Margaret suddenly
felt how her speech might be misunderstood by him; so, in the natural
sweet desire to avoid giving unnecessary pain, she forced herself to go
forwards with a little greeting, and continue what she was saying,
addressing herself to him expressly.

'Now, Mr. Thornton, though "knobstick" has not a very pretty sound, is
it not expressive? Could I do without it, in speaking of the thing it
represents? If using local words is vulgar, I was very vulgar in the
Forest,--was I not, mamma?'

It was unusual with Margaret to obtrude her own subject of conversation
on others; but, in this case, she was so anxious to prevent Mr. Thornton
from feeling annoyance at the words he had accidentally overheard, that
it was not until she had done speaking that she coloured all over with
consciousness, more especially as Mr. Thornton seemed hardly to
understand the exact gist or bearing of what she was saying, but passed
her by, with a cold reserve of ceremonious movement, to speak to Mrs.
Hale.

The sight of him reminded her of the wish to see his mother, and commend
Margaret to her care. Margaret, sitting in burning silence, vexed and
ashamed of her difficulty in keeping her right place, and her calm
unconsciousness of heart, when Mr. Thornton was by, heard her mother's
slow entreaty that Mrs. Thornton would come and see her; see her soon;
to-morrow, if it were possible. Mr. Thornton promised that she
should--conversed a little, and then took his leave; and Margaret's
movements and voice seemed at once released from some invisible chains.
He never looked at her; and yet, the careful avoidance of his eyes
betokened that in some way he knew exactly where, if they fell by
chance, they would rest on her. If she spoke, he gave no sign of
attention, and yet his next speech to any one else was modified by what
she had said; sometimes there was an express answer to what she had
remarked, but given to another person as though unsuggested by her. It
was not the bad manners of ignorance; it was the wilful bad manners
arising from deep offence. It was wilful at the time, repented of
afterwards. But no deep plan, no careful cunning could have stood him in
such good stead. Margaret thought about him more than she had ever done
before; not with any tinge of what is called love, but with regret that
she had wounded him so deeply,--and with a gentle, patient striving to
return to their former position of antagonistic friendship; for a
friend's position was what she found that he had held in her regard, as
well as in that of the rest of the family. There was a pretty humility
in her behaviour to him, as if mutely apologising for the over-strong
words which were the reaction from the deeds of the day of the riot.

But he resented those words bitterly. They rung in his ears; and he was
proud of the sense of justice which made him go on in every kindness he
could offer to her parents. He exulted in the power he showed in
compelling himself to face her, whenever he could think of any action
which might give her father or mother pleasure. He thought that he
disliked seeing one who had mortified him so keenly; but he was
mistaken. It was a stinging pleasure to be in the room with her, and
feel her presence. But he was no great analyser of his own motives, and
was mistaken as I have said.




CHAPTER XXX

HOME AT LAST

    'The saddest birds a season find to sing.'
             SOUTHWELL.

    'Never to fold the robe o'er secret pain,
     Never, weighed down by memory's clouds again,
     To bow thy head! Thou art gone home!'
             MRS. HEMANS.


Mrs. Thornton came to see Mrs. Hale the next morning. She was much
worse. One of those sudden changes--those great visible strides towards
death, had been taken in the night, and her own family were startled by
the gray sunken look her features had assumed in that one twelve hours
of suffering. Mrs. Thornton--who had not seen her for weeks--was
softened all at once. She had come because her son asked it from her as
a personal favour, but with all the proud bitter feelings of her nature
in arms against that family of which Margaret formed one. She doubted
the reality of Mrs. Hale's illness; she doubted any want beyond a
momentary fancy on that lady's part, which should take her out of her
previously settled course of employment for the day. She told her son
that she wished they had never come near the place; that he had never
got acquainted with them; that there had been no such useless languages
as Latin and Greek ever invented. He bore all this pretty silently; but
when she had ended her invective against the dead languages, he quietly
returned to the short, curt, decided expression of his wish that she
should go and see Mrs. Hale at the time appointed, as most likely to be
convenient to the invalid. Mrs. Thornton submitted with as bad a grace
as she could to her son's desire, all the time liking him the better for
having it; and exaggerating in her own mind the same notion that he had
of extraordinary goodness on his part in so perseveringly keeping up
with the Hales.

His goodness verging on weakness (as all the softer virtues did in her
mind), and her own contempt for Mr. and Mrs. Hale, and positive dislike
to Margaret, were the ideas which occupied Mrs. Thornton, till she was
struck into nothingness before the dark shadow of the wings of the angel
of death. There lay Mrs. Hale--a mother like herself--a much younger
woman than she was,--on the bed from which there was no sign of hope
that she might ever rise again. No more variety of light and shade for
her in that darkened room; no power of action, scarcely change of
movement; faint alternations of whispered sound and studious silence;
and yet that monotonous life seemed almost too much! When Mrs. Thornton,
strong and prosperous with life, came in, Mrs. Hale lay still, although
from the look on her face she was evidently conscious of who it was. But
she did not even open her eyes for a minute or two. The heavy moisture
of tears stood on the eye-lashes before she looked up, then with her
hand groping feebly over the bed-clothes, for the touch of Mrs.
Thornton's large firm fingers, she said, scarcely above her breath--Mrs.
Thornton had to stoop from her erectness to listen,--

'Margaret--you have a daughter--my sister is in Italy. My child will be
without a mother;--in a strange place,--if I die--will you'----

And her filmy wandering eyes fixed themselves with an intensity of
wistfulness on Mrs. Thornton's face. For a minute, there was no change
in its rigidness; it was stern and unmoved;--nay, but that the eyes of
the sick woman were growing dim with the slow-gathering tears, she might
have seen a dark cloud cross the cold features. And it was no thought of
her son, or of her living daughter Fanny, that stirred her heart at
last; but a sudden remembrance, suggested by something in the
arrangement of the room,--of a little daughter--dead in infancy--long
years ago--that, like a sudden sunbeam, melted the icy crust, behind
which there was a real tender woman.

'You wish me to be a friend to Miss Hale,' said Mrs. Thornton, in her
measured voice, that would not soften with her heart, but came out
distinct and clear.

Mrs. Hale, her eyes still fixed on Mrs. Thornton's face, pressed the
hand that lay below hers on the coverlet. She could not speak. Mrs.
Thornton sighed, 'I will be a true friend, if circumstances require it.
Not a tender friend. That I cannot be,'--('to her,' she was on the point
of adding, but she relented at the sight of that poor, anxious
face.)--'It is not my nature to show affection even where I feel it, nor
do I volunteer advice in general. Still, at your request,--if it will be
any comfort to you, I will promise you.' Then came a pause. Mrs.
Thornton was too conscientious to promise what she did not mean to
perform; and to perform any-thing in the way of kindness on behalf of
Margaret, more disliked at this moment than ever, was difficult; almost
impossible.

'I promise,' said she, with grave severity; which, after all, inspired
the dying woman with faith as in something more stable than life
itself,--flickering, flitting, wavering life! 'I promise that in any
difficulty in which Miss Hale'----

'Call her Margaret!' gasped Mrs. Hale.

'In which she comes to me for help, I will help her with every power I
have, as if she were my own daughter. I also promise that if ever I see
her doing what I think is wrong'----

'But Margaret never does wrong--not wilfully wrong,' pleaded Mrs. Hale.
Mrs. Thornton went on as before; as if she had not heard:

'If ever I see her doing what I believe to be wrong--such wrong not
touching me or mine, in which case I might be supposed to have an
interested motive--I will tell her of it, faithfully and plainly, as I
should wish my own daughter to be told.'

There was a long pause. Mrs. Hale felt that this promise did not include
all; and yet it was much. It had reservations in it which she did not
understand; but then she was weak, dizzy, and tired. Mrs. Thornton was
reviewing all the probable cases in which she had pledged herself to
act. She had a fierce pleasure in the idea of telling Margaret unwelcome
truths, in the shape of performance of duty. Mrs. Hale began to speak:

'I thank you. I pray God to bless you. I shall never see you again in
this world. But my last words are, I thank you for your promise of
kindness to my child.'

'Not kindness!' testified Mrs. Thornton, ungraciously truthful to the
last. But having eased her conscience by saying these words, she was not
sorry that they were not heard. She pressed Mrs. Hale's soft languid
hand; and rose up and went her way out of the house without seeing a
creature.

During the time that Mrs. Thornton was having this interview with Mrs.
Hale, Margaret and Dixon were laying their heads together, and
consulting how they should keep Frederick's coming a profound secret to
all out of the house. A letter from him might now be expected any day;
and he would assuredly follow quickly on its heels. Martha must be sent
away on her holiday; Dixon must keep stern guard on the front door, only
admitting the few visitors that ever came to the house into Mr. Hale's
room down-stairs--Mrs. Hale's extreme illness giving her a good excuse
for this. If Mary Higgins was required as a help to Dixon in the kitchen
she was to hear and see as little of Frederick as possible; and he was,
if necessary to be spoken of to her under the name of Mr. Dickinson. But
her sluggish and incurious nature was the greatest safeguard of all.

They resolved that Martha should leave them that very afternoon for this
visit to her mother. Margaret wished that she had been sent away on the
previous day, as she fancied it might be thought strange to give a
servant a holiday when her mistress's state required so much attendance.

Poor Margaret! All that afternoon she had to act the part of a Roman
daughter, and give strength out of her own scanty stock to her father.
Mr. Hale would hope, would not despair, between the attacks of his
wife's malady; he buoyed himself up in every respite from her pain, and
believed that it was the beginning of ultimate recovery. And so, when
the paroxysms came on, each more severe than the last, they were fresh
agonies, and greater disappointments to him. This afternoon, he sat in
the drawing-room, unable to bear the solitude of his study, or to employ
himself in any way. He buried his head in his arms, which lay folded on
the table. Margaret's heart ached to see him; yet, as he did not speak,
she did not like to volunteer any attempt at comfort. Martha was gone.
Dixon sat with Mrs. Hale while she slept. The house was very still and
quiet, and darkness came on, without any movement to procure candles.
Margaret sat at the window, looking out at the lamps and the street, but
seeing nothing,--only alive to her father's heavy sighs. She did not
like to go down for lights, lest the tacit restraint of her presence
being withdrawn, he might give way to more violent emotion, without her
being at hand to comfort him. Yet she was just thinking that she ought
to go and see after the well-doing of the kitchen fire, which there was
nobody but herself to attend to when she heard the muffled door-ring
with so violent a pull, that the wires jingled all through the house,
though the positive sound was not great. She started up, passed her
father, who had never moved at the veiled, dull sound,--returned, and
kissed him tenderly. And still he never moved, nor took any notice of
her fond embrace. Then she went down softly, through the dark, to the
door. Dixon would have put the chain on before she opened it, but
Margaret had not a thought of fear in her pre-occupied mind. A man's
tall figure stood between her and the luminous street. He was looking
away; but at the sound of the latch he turned quickly round.

'Is this Mr. Hale's?' said he, in a clear, full, delicate voice.

Margaret trembled all over; at first she did not answer. In a moment she
sighed out,

'Frederick!' and stretched out both her hands to catch his, and draw him
in.

'Oh, Margaret!' said he, holding her off by her shoulders, after they
had kissed each other, as if even in that darkness he could see her
face, and read in its expression a quicker answer to his question than
words could give,--

'My mother! is she alive?'

'Yes, she is alive, dear, dear brother! She--as ill as she can be she
is; but alive! She is alive!'

'Thank God!' said he.

'Papa is utterly prostrate with this great grief.'

'You expect me, don't you?'

'No, we have had no letter.'

'Then I have come before it. But my mother knows I am coming?'

'Oh! we all knew you would come. But wait a little! Step in here. Give
me your hand. What is this? Oh! your carpet-bag. Dixon has shut the
shutters; but this is papa's study, and I can take you to a chair to
rest yourself for a few minutes; while I go and tell him.'

She groped her way to the taper and the lucifer matches. She suddenly
felt shy, when the little feeble light made them visible. All she could
see was, that her brother's face was unusually dark in complexion, and
she caught the stealthy look of a pair of remarkably long-cut blue eyes,
that suddenly twinkled up with a droll consciousness of their mutual
purpose of inspecting each other. But though the brother and sister had
an instant of sympathy in their reciprocal glances, they did not
exchange a word; only, Margaret felt sure that she should like her
brother as a companion as much as she already loved him as a near
relation. Her heart was wonderfully lighter as she went up-stairs; the
sorrow was no less in reality, but it became less oppressive from having
some one in precisely the same relation to it as that in which she
stood. Not her father's desponding attitude had power to damp her now.
He lay across the table, helpless as ever; but she had the spell by
which to rouse him. She used it perhaps too violently in her own great
relief.

'Papa,' said she, throwing her arms fondly round his neck; pulling his
weary head up in fact with her gentle violence, till it rested in her
arms, and she could look into his eyes, and let them gain strength and
assurance from hers.

'Papa! guess who is here!'

He looked at her; she saw the idea of the truth glimmer into their filmy
sadness, and be dismissed thence as a wild imagination.

He threw himself forward, and hid his face once more in his
stretched-out arms, resting upon the table as heretofore. She heard him
whisper; she bent tenderly down to listen. 'I don't know. Don't tell me
it is Frederick--not Frederick. I cannot bear it,--I am too weak. And
his mother is dying!' He began to cry and wail like a child. It was so
different to all which Margaret had hoped and expected, that she turned
sick with disappointment, and was silent for an instant. Then she spoke
again--very differently--not so exultingly, far more tenderly and
carefully.

'Papa, it is Frederick! Think of mamma, how glad she will be! And oh,
for her sake, how glad we ought to be! For his sake, too,--our poor,
poor boy!'

Her father did not change his attitude, but he seemed to be trying to
understand the fact.

'Where is he?' asked he at last, his face still hidden in his prostrate
arms.

'In your study, quite alone. I lighted the taper, and ran up to tell
you. He is quite alone, and will be wondering why--'

'I will go to him,' broke in her father; and he lifted himself up and
leant on her arm as on that of a guide.

Margaret led him to the study door, but her spirits were so agitated
that she felt she could not bear to see the meeting. She turned away,
and ran up-stairs, and cried most heartily. It was the first time she
had dared to allow herself this relief for days. The strain had been
terrible, as she now felt. But Frederick was come! He, the one precious
brother, was there, safe, amongst them again! She could hardly believe
it. She stopped her crying, and opened her bedroom door. She heard no
sound of voices, and almost feared she might have dreamt. She went
down-stairs, and listened at the study door. She heard the buzz of
voices; and that was enough. She went into the kitchen, and stirred up
the fire, and lighted the house, and prepared for the wanderer's
refreshment. How fortunate it was that her mother slept! She knew that
she did, from the candle-lighter thrust through the keyhole of her
bedroom door. The traveller could be refreshed and bright, and the first
excitement of the meeting with his father all be over, before her mother
became aware of anything unusual.

When all was ready, Margaret opened the study door, and went in like a
serving-maiden, with a heavy tray held in her extended arms. She was
proud of serving Frederick. But he, when he saw her, sprang up in a
minute, and relieved her of her burden. It was a type, a sign, of all
the coming relief which his presence would bring. The brother and sister
arranged the table together, saying little, but their hands touching,
and their eyes speaking the natural language of expression, so
intelligible to those of the same blood. The fire had gone out; and
Margaret applied herself to light it, for the evenings had begun to be
chilly; and yet it was desirable to make all noises as distant as
possible from Mrs. Hale's room.

'Dixon says it is a gift to light a fire; not an art to be acquired.'

'Poeta nascitur, non fit,' murmured Mr. Hale; and Margaret was glad to
hear a quotation once more, however languidly given.

'Dear old Dixon! How we shall kiss each other!' said Frederick. 'She
used to kiss me, and then look in my face to be sure I was the right
person, and then set to again! But, Margaret, what a bungler you are! I
never saw such a little awkward, good-for-nothing pair of hands. Run
away, and wash them, ready to cut bread-and-butter for me, and leave the
fire. I'll manage it. Lighting fires is one of my natural
accomplishments.'

So Margaret went away; and returned; and passed in and out of the room,
in a glad restlessness that could not be satisfied with sitting still.
The more wants Frederick had, the better she was pleased; and he
understood all this by instinct. It was a joy snatched in the house of
mourning, and the zest of it was all the more pungent, because they knew
in the depths of their hearts what irremediable sorrow awaited them.

In the middle, they heard Dixon's foot on the stairs. Mr. Hale started
from his languid posture in his great armchair, from which he had been
watching his children in a dreamy way, as if they were acting some drama
of happiness, which it was pretty to look at, but which was distinct
from reality, and in which he had no part. He stood up, and faced the
door, showing such a strange, sudden anxiety to conceal Frederick from
the sight of any person entering, even though it were the faithful
Dixon, that a shiver came over Margaret's heart: it reminded her of the
new fear in their lives. She caught at Frederick's arm, and clutched it
tight, while a stern thought compressed her brows, and caused her to set
her teeth. And yet they knew it was only Dixon's measured tread. They
heard her walk the length of the passage, into the kitchen. Margaret
rose up.

'I will go to her, and tell her. And I shall hear how mamma is.' Mrs.
Hale was awake. She rambled at first; but after they had given her some
tea she was refreshed, though not disposed to talk. It was better that
the night should pass over before she was told of her son's arrival. Dr.
Donaldson's appointed visit would bring nervous excitement enough for
the evening; and he might tell them how to prepare her for seeing
Frederick. He was there, in the house; could be summoned at any moment.

Margaret could not sit still. It was a relief to her to aid Dixon in all
her preparations for 'Master Frederick.' It seemed as though she never
could be tired again. Each glimpse into the room where he sate by his
father, conversing with him, about, she knew not what, nor cared to
know,--was increase of strength to her. Her own time for talking and
hearing would come at last, and she was too certain of this to feel in a
hurry to grasp it now. She took in his appearance and liked it. He had
delicate features, redeemed from effeminacy by the swarthiness of his
complexion, and his quick intensity of expression. His eyes were
generally merry-looking, but at times they and his mouth so suddenly
changed, and gave her such an idea of latent passion, that it almost
made her afraid. But this look was only for an instant; and had in it no
doggedness, no vindictiveness; it was rather the instantaneous ferocity
of expression that comes over the countenances of all natives of wild or
southern countries--a ferocity which enhances the charm of the childlike
softness into which such a look may melt away. Margaret might fear the
violence of the impulsive nature thus occasionally betrayed, but there
was nothing in it to make her distrust, or recoil in the least, from the
new-found brother. On the contrary, all their intercourse was peculiarly
charming to her from the very first. She knew then how much
responsibility she had had to bear, from the exquisite sensation of
relief which she felt in Frederick's presence. He understood his father
and mother--their characters and their weaknesses, and went along with a
careless freedom, which was yet most delicately careful not to hurt or
wound any of their feelings. He seemed to know instinctively when a
little of the natural brilliancy of his manner and conversation would
not jar on the deep depression of his father, or might relieve his
mother's pain. Whenever it would have been out of tune, and out of time,
his patient devotion and watchfulness came into play, and made him an
admirable nurse. Then Margaret was almost touched into tears by the
allusions which he often made to their childish days in the New Forest;
he had never forgotten her--or Helstone either--all the time he had been
roaming among distant countries and foreign people. She might talk to
him of the old spot, and never fear tiring him. She had been afraid of
him before he came, even while she had longed for his coming; seven or
eight years had, she felt, produced such great changes in herself that,
forgetting how much of the original Margaret was left, she had reasoned
that if her tastes and feelings had so materially altered, even in her
stay-at-home life, his wild career, with which she was but imperfectly
acquainted, must have almost substituted another Frederick for the tall
stripling in his middy's uniform, whom she remembered looking up to with
such admiring awe. But in their absence they had grown nearer to each
other in age, as well as in many other things. And so it was that the
weight, this sorrowful time, was lightened to Margaret. Other light than
that of Frederick's presence she had none. For a few hours, the mother
rallied on seeing her son. She sate with his hand in hers; she would not
part with it even while she slept; and Margaret had to feed him like a
baby, rather than that he should disturb her mother by removing a
finger. Mrs. Hale wakened while they were thus engaged; she slowly moved
her head round on the pillow, and smiled at her children, as she
understood what they were doing, and why it was done.

'I am very selfish,' said she; 'but it will not be for long.' Frederick
bent down and kissed the feeble hand that imprisoned his.

This state of tranquillity could not endure for many days, nor perhaps
for many hours; so Dr. Donaldson assured Margaret. After the kind doctor
had gone away, she stole down to Frederick, who, during the visit, had
been adjured to remain quietly concealed in the back parlour, usually
Dixon's bedroom, but now given up to him.

Margaret told him what Dr. Donaldson said.

'I don't believe it,' he exclaimed. 'She is very ill; she may be
dangerously ill, and in immediate danger, too; but I can't imagine that
she could be as she is, if she were on the point of death. Margaret! she
should have some other advice--some London doctor. Have you never
thought of that?'

'Yes,' said Margaret, 'more than once. But I don't believe it would do
any good. And, you know, we have not the money to bring any great London
surgeon down, and I am sure Dr. Donaldson is only second in skill to the
very best,--if, indeed, he is to them.'

Frederick began to walk up and down the room impatiently.

'I have credit in Cadiz,' said he, 'but none here, owing to this
wretched change of name. Why did my father leave Helstone? That was the
blunder.'

'It was no blunder,' said Margaret gloomily. 'And above all possible
chances, avoid letting papa hear anything like what you have just been
saying. I can see that he is tormenting himself already with the idea
that mamma would never have been ill if we had stayed at Helstone, and
you don't know papa's agonising power of self-reproach!'

Frederick walked away as if he were on the quarter-deck. At last he
stopped right opposite to Margaret, and looked at her drooping and
desponding attitude for an instant.

'My little Margaret!' said he, caressing her. 'Let us hope as long as we
can. Poor little woman! what! is this face all wet with tears? I will
hope. I will, in spite of a thousand doctors. Bear up, Margaret, and be
brave enough to hope!'

Margaret choked in trying to speak, and when she did it was very low.

'I must try to be meek enough to trust. Oh, Frederick! mamma was getting
to love me so! And I was getting to understand her. And now comes death
to snap us asunder!'

'Come, come, come! Let us go up-stairs, and do something, rather than
waste time that may be so precious. Thinking has, many a time, made me
sad, darling; but doing never did in all my life. My theory is a sort of
parody on the maxim of "Get money, my son, honestly if you can; but get
money." My precept is, "Do something, my sister, do good if you can;
but, at any rate, do something."'

'Not excluding mischief,' said Margaret, smiling faintly through her
tears.

'By no means. What I do exclude is the remorse afterwards. Blot your
misdeeds out (if you are particularly conscientious), by a good deed, as
soon as you can; just as we did a correct sum at school on the slate,
where an incorrect one was only half rubbed out. It was better than
wetting our sponge with our tears; both less loss of time where tears
had to be waited for, and a better effect at last.'

If Margaret thought Frederick's theory rather a rough one at first, she
saw how he worked it out into continual production of kindness in fact.
After a bad night with his mother (for he insisted on taking his turn as
a sitter-up) he was busy next morning before breakfast, contriving a
leg-rest for Dixon, who was beginning to feel the fatigues of watching.
At breakfast-time, he interested Mr. Hale with vivid, graphic, rattling
accounts of the wild life he had led in Mexico, South America, and
elsewhere. Margaret would have given up the effort in despair to rouse
Mr. Hale out of his dejection; it would even have affected herself and
rendered her incapable of talking at all. But Fred, true to his theory,
did something perpetually; and talking was the only thing to be done,
besides eating, at breakfast.

Before the night of that day, Dr. Donaldson's opinion was proved to be
too well founded. Convulsions came on; and when they ceased, Mrs. Hale
was unconscious. Her husband might lie by her shaking the bed with his
sobs; her son's strong arms might lift her tenderly up into a
comfortable position; her daughter's hands might bathe her face; but she
knew them not. She would never recognise them again, till they met in
Heaven.

Before the morning came all was over.

Then Margaret rose from her trembling and despondency, and became as a
strong angel of comfort to her father and brother. For Frederick had
broken down now, and all his theories were of no use to him. He cried so
violently when shut up alone in his little room at night, that Margaret
and Dixon came down in affright to warn him to be quiet: for the house
partitions were but thin, and the next-door neighbours might easily hear
his youthful passionate sobs, so different from the slower trembling
agony of after-life, when we become inured to grief, and dare not be
rebellious against the inexorable doom, knowing who it is that decrees.

Margaret sate with her father in the room with the dead. If he had
cried, she would have been thankful. But he sate by the bed quite
quietly; only, from time to time, he uncovered the face, and stroked it
gently, making a kind of soft inarticulate noise, like that of some
mother-animal caressing her young. He took no notice of Margaret's
presence. Once or twice she came up to kiss him; and he submitted to it,
giving her a little push away when she had done, as if her affection
disturbed him from his absorption in the dead. He started when he heard
Frederick's cries, and shook his head:--'Poor boy! poor boy!' he said,
and took no more notice. Margaret's heart ached within her. She could
not think of her own loss in thinking of her father's case. The night
was wearing away, and the day was at hand, when, without a word of
preparation, Margaret's voice broke upon the stillness of the room, with
a clearness of sound that startled even herself: 'Let not your heart be
troubled,' it said; and she went steadily on through all that chapter of
unspeakable consolation.




CHAPTER XXXI

'SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT?'

    'Show not that manner, and these features all,
     The serpent's cunning, and the sinner's fall?'
             CRABBE.


The chill, shivery October morning came; not the October morning of the
country, with soft, silvery mists, clearing off before the sunbeams that
bring out all the gorgeous beauty of colouring, but the October morning
of Milton, whose silver mists were heavy fogs, and where the sun could
only show long dusky streets when he did break through and shine.
Margaret went languidly about, assisting Dixon in her task of arranging
the house. Her eyes were continually blinded by tears, but she had no
time to give way to regular crying. The father and brother depended upon
her; while they were giving way to grief, she must be working, planning,
considering. Even the necessary arrangements for the funeral seemed to
devolve upon her.

When the fire was bright and crackling--when everything was ready for
breakfast, and the tea-kettle was singing away, Margaret gave a last
look round the room before going to summon Mr. Hale and Frederick. She
wanted everything to look as cheerful as possible; and yet, when it did
so, the contrast between it and her own thoughts forced her into sudden
weeping. She was kneeling by the sofa, hiding her face in the cushions
that no one might hear her cry, when she was touched on the shoulder by
Dixon.

'Come, Miss Hale--come, my dear! You must not give way, or where shall
we all be? There is not another person in the house fit to give a
direction of any kind, and there is so much to be done. There's who's to
manage the funeral; and who's to come to it; and where it's to be; and
all to be settled: and Master Frederick's like one crazed with crying,
and master never was a good one for settling; and, poor gentleman, he
goes about now as if he was lost. It's bad enough, my dear, I know; but
death comes to us all; and you're well off never to have lost any friend
till now.' Perhaps so. But this seemed a loss by itself; not to bear
comparison with any other event in the world. Margaret did not take any
comfort from what Dixon said, but the unusual tenderness of the prim old
servant's manner touched her to the heart; and, more from a desire to
show her gratitude for this than for any other reason, she roused
herself up, and smiled in answer to Dixon's anxious look at her; and
went to tell her father and brother that breakfast was ready.

Mr. Hale came--as if in a dream, or rather with the unconscious motion
of a sleep-walker, whose eyes and mind perceive other things than what
are present. Frederick came briskly in, with a forced cheerfulness,
grasped her hand, looked into her eyes, and burst into tears. She had to
try and think of little nothings to say all breakfast-time, in order to
prevent the recurrence of her companions' thoughts too strongly to the
last meal they had taken together, when there had been a continual
strained listening for some sound or signal from the sick-room.

After breakfast, she resolved to speak to her father, about the funeral.
He shook his head, and assented to all she proposed, though many of her
propositions absolutely contradicted one another. Margaret gained no
real decision from him; and was leaving the room languidly, to have a
consultation with Dixon, when Mr. Hale motioned her back to his side.

'Ask Mr. Bell,' said he in a hollow voice.

'Mr. Bell!' said she, a little surprised. 'Mr. Bell of Oxford?'

'Mr. Bell,' he repeated. 'Yes. He was my groom's-man.'

Margaret understood the association.

'I will write to-day,' said she. He sank again into listlessness. All
morning she toiled on, longing for rest, but in a continual whirl of
melancholy business.

Towards evening, Dixon said to her:

'I've done it, miss. I was really afraid for master, that he'd have a
stroke with grief. He's been all this day with poor missus; and when
I've listened at the door, I've heard him talking to her, and talking to
her, as if she was alive. When I went in he would be quite quiet, but
all in a maze like. So I thought to myself, he ought to be roused; and
if it gives him a shock at first, it will, maybe, be the better
afterwards. So I've been and told him, that I don't think it's safe for
Master Frederick to be here. And I don't. It was only on Tuesday, when I
was out, that I met a Southampton man--the first I've seen since I came
to Milton; they don't make their way much up here, I think. Well, it was
young Leonards, old Leonards the draper's son, as great a scamp as ever
lived--who plagued his father almost to death, and then ran off to sea.
I never could abide him. He was in the Orion at the same time as Master
Frederick, I know; though I don't recollect if he was there at the
mutiny.'

'Did he know you?' said Margaret, eagerly.

'Why, that's the worst of it. I don't believe he would have known me but
for my being such a fool as to call out his name. He were a Southampton
man, in a strange place, or else I should never have been so ready to
call cousins with him, a nasty, good-for-nothing fellow. Says he, "Miss
Dixon! who would ha' thought of seeing you here? But perhaps I mistake,
and you're Miss Dixon no longer?" So I told him he might still address
me as an unmarried lady, though if I hadn't been so particular, I'd had
good chances of matrimony. He was polite enough: "He couldn't look at me
and doubt me." But I were not to be caught with such chaff from such a
fellow as him, and so I told him; and, by way of being even, I asked him
after his father (who I knew had turned him out of doors), as if they
was the best friends as ever was. So then, to spite me--for you see we
were getting savage, for all we were so civil to each other--he began to
inquire after Master Frederick, and said, what a scrape he'd got into
(as if Master Frederick's scrapes would ever wash George Leonards'
white, or make 'em look otherwise than nasty, dirty black), and how he'd
be hung for mutiny if ever he were caught, and how a hundred pound
reward had been offered for catching him, and what a disgrace he had
been to his family--all to spite me, you see, my dear, because before
now I've helped old Mr. Leonards to give George a good rating, down in
Southampton. So I said, there were other families be thankful if they
could think they were earning an honest living as I knew, who had far
more cause to blush for their sons, and to far away from home. To which
he made answer, like the impudent chap he is, that he were in a
confidential situation, and if I knew of any young man who had been so
unfortunate as to lead vicious courses, and wanted to turn steady, he'd
have no objection to lend him his patronage. He, indeed! Why, he'd
corrupt a saint. I've not felt so bad myself for years as when I were
standing talking to him the other day. I could have cried to think I
couldn't spite him better, for he kept smiling in my face, as if he took
all my compliments for earnest; and I couldn't see that he minded what I
said in the least, while I was mad with all his speeches.'

'But you did not tell him anything about us--about Frederick?'

'Not I,' said Dixon. 'He had never the grace to ask where I was staying;
and I shouldn't have told him if he had asked. Nor did I ask him what
his precious situation was. He was waiting for a bus, and just then it
drove up, and he hailed it. But, to plague me to the last, he turned
back before he got in, and said, "If you can help me to trap Lieutenant
Hale, Miss Dixon, we'll go partners in the reward. I know you'd like to
be my partner, now wouldn't you? Don't be shy, but say yes." And he
jumped on the bus, and I saw his ugly face leering at me with a wicked
smile to think how he'd had the last word of plaguing.'

Margaret was made very uncomfortable by this account of Dixon's.

'Have you told Frederick?' asked she.

'No,' said Dixon. 'I were uneasy in my mind at knowing that bad Leonards
was in town; but there was so much else to think about that I did not
dwell on it at all. But when I saw master sitting so stiff, and with his
eyes so glazed and sad, I thought it might rouse him to have to think of
Master Frederick's safety a bit. So I told him all, though I blushed to
say how a young man had been speaking to me. And it has done master
good. And if we're to keep Master Frederick in hiding, he would have to
go, poor fellow, before Mr. Bell came.'

'Oh, I'm not afraid of Mr. Bell; but I am afraid of this Leonards. I
must tell Frederick. What did Leonards look like?'

'A bad-looking fellow, I can assure you, miss. Whiskers such as I should
be ashamed to wear--they are so red. And for all he said he'd got a
confidential situation, he was dressed in fustian just like a
working-man.'

It was evident that Frederick must go. Go, too, when he had so
completely vaulted into his place in the family, and promised to be such
a stay and staff to his father and sister. Go, when his cares for the
living mother, and sorrow for the dead, seemed to make him one of those
peculiar people who are bound to us by a fellow-love for them that are
taken away. Just as Margaret was thinking all this, sitting over the
drawing-room fire--her father restless and uneasy under the pressure of
this newly-aroused fear, of which he had not as yet spoken--Frederick
came in, his brightness dimmed, but the extreme violence of his grief
passed away. He came up to Margaret, and kissed her forehead.

'How wan you look, Margaret!' said he in a low voice. 'You have been
thinking of everybody, and no one has thought of you. Lie on this
sofa--there is nothing for you to do.'

'That is the worst,' said Margaret, in a sad whisper. But she went and
lay down, and her brother covered her feet with a shawl, and then sate
on the ground by her side; and the two began to talk in a subdued tone.

Margaret told him all that Dixon had related of her interview with young
Leonards. Frederick's lips closed with a long whew of dismay.

'I should just like to have it out with that young fellow. A worse
sailor was never on board ship--nor a much worse man either. I declare,
Margaret--you know the circumstances of the whole affair?'

'Yes, mamma told me.'

'Well, when all the sailors who were good for anything were indignant
with our captain, this fellow, to curry favour--pah! And to think of his
being here! Oh, if he'd a notion I was within twenty miles of him, he'd
ferret me out to pay off old grudges. I'd rather anybody had the hundred
pounds they think I am worth than that rascal. What a pity poor old
Dixon could not be persuaded to give me up, and make a provision for her
old age!'

'Oh, Frederick, hush! Don't talk so.'

Mr. Hale came towards them, eager and trembling. He had overheard what
they were saying. He took Frederick's hand in both of his:

'My boy, you must go. It is very bad--but I see you must. You have done
all you could--you have been a comfort to her.'

'Oh, papa, must he go?' said Margaret, pleading against her own
conviction of necessity.

'I declare, I've a good mind to face it out, and stand my trial. If I
could only pick up my evidence! I cannot endure the thought of being in
the power of such a blackguard as Leonards. I could almost have
enjoyed--in other circumstances--this stolen visit: it has had all the
charm which the French-woman attributed to forbidden pleasures.'

'One of the earliest things I can remember,' said Margaret, 'was your
being in some great disgrace, Fred, for stealing apples. We had plenty
of our own--trees loaded with them; but some one had told you that
stolen fruit tasted sweetest, which you took au pied de la lettre, and
off you went a-robbing. You have not changed your feelings much since
then.'

'Yes--you must go,' repeated Mr. Hale, answering Margaret's question,
which she had asked some time ago. His thoughts were fixed on one
subject, and it was an effort to him to follow the zig-zag remarks of
his children--an effort which he did not make.

Margaret and Frederick looked at each other. That quick momentary
sympathy would be theirs no longer if he went away. So much was
understood through eyes that could not be put into words. Both coursed
the same thought till it was lost in sadness. Frederick shook it off
first:

'Do you know, Margaret, I was very nearly giving both Dixon and myself a
good fright this afternoon. I was in my bedroom; I had heard a ring at
the front door, but I thought the ringer must have done his business and
gone away long ago; so I was on the point of making my appearance in the
passage, when, as I opened my room door, I saw Dixon coming downstairs;
and she frowned and kicked me into hiding again. I kept the door open,
and heard a message given to some man that was in my father's study, and
that then went away. Who could it have been? Some of the shopmen?'

'Very likely,' said Margaret, indifferently. 'There was a little quiet
man who came up for orders about two o'clock.'

'But this was not a little man--a great powerful fellow; and it was past
four when he was here.'

'It was Mr. Thornton,' said Mr. Hale. They were glad to have drawn him
into the conversation.

'Mr. Thornton!' said Margaret, a little surprised. 'I thought---- '

'Well, little one, what did you think?' asked Frederick, as she did not
finish her sentence.

'Oh, only,' said she, reddening and looking straight at him, 'I fancied
you meant some one of a different class, not a gentleman; somebody come
on an errand.'

'He looked like some one of that kind,' said Frederick, carelessly. 'I
took him for a shopman, and he turns out a manufacturer.'

Margaret was silent. She remembered how at first, before she knew his
character, she had spoken and thought of him just as Frederick was
doing. It was but a natural impression that was made upon him, and yet
she was a little annoyed by it. She was unwilling to speak; she wanted
to make Frederick understand what kind of person Mr. Thornton was--but
she was tongue-tied.

Mr. Hale went on. 'He came to offer any assistance in his power, I
believe. But I could not see him. I told Dixon to ask him if he would
like to see you--I think I asked her to find you, and you would go to
him. I don't know what I said.'

'He has been a very agreeable acquaintance, has he not?' asked
Frederick, throwing the question like a ball for any one to catch who
chose.

'A very kind friend,' said Margaret, when her father did not answer.

Frederick was silent for a time. At last he spoke:

'Margaret, it is painful to think I can never thank those who have shown
you kindness. Your acquaintances and mine must be separate. Unless,
indeed, I run the chances of a court-martial, or unless you and my
father would come to Spain.' He threw out this last suggestion as a kind
of feeler; and then suddenly made the plunge. 'You don't know how I wish
you would. I have a good position--the chance of a better,' continued
he, reddening like a girl. 'That Dolores Barbour that I was telling you
of, Margaret--I only wish you knew her; I am sure you would like--no,
love is the right word, like is so poor--you would love her, father, if
you knew her. She is not eighteen; but if she is in the same mind
another year, she is to be my wife. Mr. Barbour won't let us call it an
engagement. But if you would come, you would find friends everywhere,
besides Dolores. Think of it, father. Margaret, be on my side.'

'No--no more removals for me,' said Mr. Hale. 'One removal has cost me
my wife. No more removals in this life. She will be here; and here will
I stay out my appointed time.'

'Oh, Frederick,' said Margaret, 'tell us more about her. I never thought
of this; but I am so glad. You will have some one to love and care for
you out there. Tell us all about it.'

'In the first place, she is a Roman Catholic. That's the only objection
I anticipated. But my father's change of opinion--nay, Margaret, don't
sigh.'

Margaret had reason to sigh a little more before the conversation ended.
Frederick himself was Roman Catholic in fact, though not in profession
as yet. This was, then, the reason why his sympathy in her extreme
distress at her father's leaving the Church had been so faintly
expressed in his letters. She had thought it was the carelessness of a
sailor; but the truth was, that even then he was himself inclined to
give up the form of religion into which he had been baptised, only that
his opinions were tending in exactly the opposite direction to those of
his father. How much love had to do with this change not even Frederick
himself could have told. Margaret gave up talking about this branch of
the subject at last; and, returning to the fact of the engagement, she
began to consider it in some fresh light:

'But for her sake, Fred, you surely will try and clear yourself of the
exaggerated charges brought against you, even if the charge of mutiny
itself be true. If there were to be a court-martial, and you could find
your witnesses, you might, at any rate, show how your disobedience to
authority was because that authority was unworthily exercised.'

Mr. Hale roused himself up to listen to his son's answer.

'In the first place, Margaret, who is to hunt up my witnesses? All of
them are sailors, drafted off to other ships, except those whose
evidence would go for very little, as they took part, or sympathised in
the affair. In the next place, allow me to tell you, you don't know what
a court-martial is, and consider it as an assembly where justice is
administered, instead of what it really is--a court where authority
weighs nine-tenths in the balance, and evidence forms only the other
tenth. In such cases, evidence itself can hardly escape being influenced
by the prestige of authority.'

'But is it not worth trying, to see how much evidence might be
discovered and arrayed on your behalf? At present, all those who knew
you formerly, believe you guilty without any shadow of excuse. You have
never tried to justify yourself, and we have never known where to seek
for proofs of your justification. Now, for Miss Barbour's sake, make
your conduct as clear as you can in the eye of the world. She may not
care for it; she has, I am sure, that trust in you that we all have; but
you ought not to let her ally herself to one under such a serious
charge, without showing the world exactly how it is you stand. You
disobeyed authority--that was bad; but to have stood by, without word or
act, while the authority was brutally used, would have been infinitely
worse. People know what you did; but not the motives that elevate it out
of a crime into an heroic protection of the weak. For Dolores' sake,
they ought to know.'

'But how must I make them know? I am not sufficiently sure of the purity
and justice of those who would be my judges, to give myself up to a
court-martial, even if I could bring a whole array of truth-speaking
witnesses. I can't send a bellman about, to cry aloud and proclaim in
the streets what you are pleased to call my heroism. No one would read a
pamphlet of self-justification so long after the deed, even if I put one
out.'

'Will you consult a lawyer as to your chances of exculpation?' asked
Margaret, looking up, and turning very red.

'I must first catch my lawyer, and have a look at him, and see how I
like him, before I make him into my confidant. Many a briefless
barrister might twist his conscience into thinking that he could earn a
hundred pounds very easily by doing a good action--in giving me, a
criminal, up to justice.'

'Nonsense, Frederick!--because I know a lawyer on whose honour I can
rely; of whose cleverness in his profession people speak very highly;
and who would, I think, take a good deal of trouble for any of--of Aunt
Shaw's relations. Mr. Henry Lennox, papa.'

'I think it is a good idea,' said Mr. Hale. 'But don't propose anything
which will detain Frederick in England. Don't, for your mother's sake.'

'You could go to London to-morrow evening by a night-train,' continued
Margaret, warming up into her plan. 'He must go to-morrow, I'm afraid,
papa,' said she, tenderly; 'we fixed that, because of Mr. Bell, and
Dixon's disagreeable acquaintance.'

'Yes; I must go to-morrow,' said Frederick decidedly.

Mr. Hale groaned. 'I can't bear to part with you, and yet I am miserable
with anxiety as long as you stop here.'

'Well then,' said Margaret, 'listen to my plan. He gets to London on
Friday morning. I will--you might--no! it would be better for me to give
him a note to Mr. Lennox. You will find him at his chambers in the
Temple.'

'I will write down a list of all the names I can remember on board the
Orion. I could leave it with him to ferret them out. He is Edith's
husband's brother, isn't he? I remember your naming him in your letters.
I have money in Barbour's hands. I can pay a pretty long bill, if there
is any chance of success. Money, dear father, that I had meant for a
different purpose; so I shall only consider it as borrowed from you and
Margaret.'

'Don't do that,' said Margaret. 'You won't risk it if you do. And it
will be a risk only it is worth trying. You can sail from London as well
as from Liverpool?'

'To be sure, little goose. Wherever I feel water heaving under a plank,
there I feel at home. I'll pick up some craft or other to take me off,
never fear. I won't stay twenty-four hours in London, away from you on
the one hand, and from somebody else on the other.'

It was rather a comfort to Margaret that Frederick took it into his head
to look over her shoulder as she wrote to Mr. Lennox. If she had not
been thus compelled to write steadily and concisely on, she might have
hesitated over many a word, and been puzzled to choose between many an
expression, in the awkwardness of being the first to resume the
intercourse of which the concluding event had been so unpleasant to both
sides. However, the note was taken from her before she had even had time
to look it over, and treasured up in a pocket-book, out of which fell a
long lock of black hair, the sight of which caused Frederick's eyes to
glow with pleasure.

'Now you would like to see that, wouldn't you?' said he. 'No! you must
wait till you see her herself. She is too perfect to be known by
fragments. No mean brick shall be a specimen of the building of my
palace.'




CHAPTER XXXII

MISCHANCES

    'What! remain to be
     Denounced--dragged, it may be, in chains.'
             WERNER.


All the next day they sate together--they three. Mr. Hale hardly ever
spoke but when his children asked him questions, and forced him, as it
were, into the present. Frederick's grief was no more to be seen or
heard; the first paroxysm had passed over, and now he was ashamed of
having been so battered down by emotion; and though his sorrow for the
loss of his mother was a deep real feeling, and would last out his life,
it was never to be spoken of again. Margaret, not so passionate at
first, was more suffering now. At times she cried a good deal; and her
manner, even when speaking on indifferent things, had a mournful
tenderness about it, which was deepened whenever her looks fell on
Frederick, and she thought of his rapidly approaching departure. She was
glad he was going, on her father's account, however much she might
grieve over it on her own. The anxious terror in which Mr. Hale lived
lest his son should be detected and captured, far out-weighed the
pleasure he derived from his presence. The nervousness had increased
since Mrs. Hale's death, probably because he dwelt upon it more
exclusively. He started at every unusual sound; and was never
comfortable unless Frederick sate out of the immediate view of any one
entering the room. Towards evening he said:

'You will go with Frederick to the station, Margaret? I shall want to
know he is safely off. You will bring me word that he is clear of
Milton, at any rate?'

'Certainly,' said Margaret. 'I shall like it, if you won't be lonely
without me, papa.'

'No, no! I should always be fancying some one had known him, and that he
had been stopped, unless you could tell me you had seen him off. And go
to the Outwood station. It is quite as near, and not so many people
about. Take a cab there. There is less risk of his being seen. What time
is your train, Fred?'

'Ten minutes past six; very nearly dark. So what will you do, Margaret?'

'Oh, I can manage. I am getting very brave and very hard. It is a
well-lighted road all the way home, if it should be dark. But I was out
last week much later.'

Margaret was thankful when the parting was over--the parting from the
dead mother and the living father. She hurried Frederick into the cab,
in order to shorten a scene which she saw was so bitterly painful to her
father, who would accompany his son as he took his last look at his
mother. Partly in consequence of this, and partly owing to one of the
very common mistakes in the 'Railway Guide' as to the times when trains
arrive at the smaller stations, they found, on reaching Outwood, that
they had nearly twenty minutes to spare. The booking-office was not
open, so they could not even take the ticket. They accordingly went down
the flight of steps that led to the level of the ground below the
railway. There was a broad cinder-path diagonally crossing a field which
lay along-side of the carriage-road, and they went there to walk
backwards and forwards for the few minutes they had to spare.

Margaret's hand lay in Frederick's arm. He took hold of it
affectionately.

'Margaret! I am going to consult Mr. Lennox as to the chance of
exculpating myself, so that I may return to England whenever I choose,
more for your sake than for the sake of any one else. I can't bear to
think of your lonely position if anything should happen to my father. He
looks sadly changed--terribly shaken. I wish you could get him to think
of the Cadiz plan, for many reasons. What could you do if he were taken
away? You have no friend near. We are curiously bare of relations.'

Margaret could hardly keep from crying at the tender anxiety with which
Frederick was bringing before her an event which she herself felt was
not very improbable, so severely had the cares of the last few months
told upon Mr. Hale. But she tried to rally as she said:

'There have been such strange unexpected changes in my life during these
last two years, that I feel more than ever that it is not worth while to
calculate too closely what I should do if any future event took place. I
try to think only upon the present.' She paused; they were standing
still for a moment, close on the field side of the stile leading into
the road; the setting sun fell on their faces. Frederick held her hand
in his, and looked with wistful anxiety into her face, reading there
more care and trouble than she would betray by words. She went on:

'We shall write often to one another, and I will promise--for I see it
will set your mind at ease--to tell you every worry I have. Papa
is'--she started a little, a hardly visible start--but Frederick felt
the sudden motion of the hand he held, and turned his full face to the
road, along which a horseman was slowly riding, just passing the very
stile where they stood. Margaret bowed; her bow was stiffly returned.

'Who is that?' said Frederick, almost before he was out of hearing.
Margaret was a little drooping, a little flushed, as she replied:

'Mr. Thornton; you saw him before, you know.'

'Only his back. He is an unprepossessing-looking fellow. What a scowl he
has!'

'Something has happened to vex him,' said Margaret, apologetically. 'You
would not have thought him unprepossessing if you had seen him with
mamma.'

'I fancy it must be time to go and take my ticket. If I had known how
dark it would be, we wouldn't have sent back the cab, Margaret.'

'Oh, don't fidget about that. I can take a cab here, if I like; or go
back by the rail-road, when I should have shops and people and lamps all
the way from the Milton station-house. Don't think of me; take care of
yourself. I am sick with the thought that Leonards may be in the same
train with you. Look well into the carriage before you get in.'

They went back to the station. Margaret insisted upon going into the
full light of the flaring gas inside to take the ticket. Some
idle-looking young men were lounging about with the stationmaster.
Margaret thought she had seen the face of one of them before, and
returned him a proud look of offended dignity for his somewhat
impertinent stare of undisguised admiration. She went hastily to her
brother, who was standing outside, and took hold of his arm. 'Have you
got your bag? Let us walk about here on the platform,' said she, a
little flurried at the idea of so soon being left alone, and her bravery
oozing out rather faster than she liked to acknowledge even to herself.
She heard a step following them along the flags; it stopped when they
stopped, looking out along the line and hearing the whizz of the coming
train. They did not speak; their hearts were too full. Another moment,
and the train would be here; a minute more, and he would be gone.
Margaret almost repented the urgency with which she had entreated him to
go to London; it was throwing more chances of detection in his way. If
he had sailed for Spain by Liverpool, he might have been off in two or
three hours.

Frederick turned round, right facing the lamp, where the gas darted up
in vivid anticipation of the train. A man in the dress of a railway
porter started forward; a bad-looking man, who seemed to have drunk
himself into a state of brutality, although his senses were in perfect
order.

'By your leave, miss!' said he, pushing Margaret rudely on one side, and
seizing Frederick by the collar.

'Your name is Hale, I believe?'

In an instant--how, Margaret did not see, for everything danced before
her eyes--but by some sleight of wrestling, Frederick had tripped him
up, and he fell from the height of three or four feet, which the
platform was elevated above the space of soft ground, by the side of the
railroad. There he lay.

'Run, run!' gasped Margaret. 'The train is here. It was Leonards, was
it? oh, run! I will carry your bag.' And she took him by the arm to push
him along with all her feeble force. A door was opened in a carriage--he
jumped in; and as he leant out to say, 'God bless you, Margaret!' the
train rushed past her; an she was left standing alone. She was so
terribly sick and faint that she was thankful to be able to turn into
the ladies' waiting-room, and sit down for an instant. At first she
could do nothing but gasp for breath. It was such a hurry; such a
sickening alarm; such a near chance. If the train had not been there at
the moment, the man would have jumped up again and called for assistance
to arrest him. She wondered if the man had got up: she tried to remember
if she had seen him move; she wondered if he could have been seriously
hurt. She ventured out; the platform was all alight, but still quite
deserted; she went to the end, and looked over, somewhat fearfully. No
one was there; and then she was glad she had made herself go, and
inspect, for otherwise terrible thoughts would have haunted her dreams.
And even as it was, she was so trembling and affrighted that she felt
she could not walk home along the road, which did indeed seem lonely and
dark, as she gazed down upon it from the blaze of the station. She would
wait till the down train passed and take her seat in it. But what if
Leonards recognised her as Frederick's companion! She peered about,
before venturing into the booking-office to take her ticket. There were
only some railway officials standing about; and talking loud to one
another.

'So Leonards has been drinking again!' said one, seemingly in authority.
'He'll need all his boasted influence to keep his place this time.'

'Where is he?' asked another, while Margaret, her back towards them, was
counting her change with trembling fingers, not daring to turn round
until she heard the answer to this question.

'I don't know. He came in not five minutes ago, with some long story or
other about a fall he'd had, swearing awfully; and wanted to borrow some
money from me to go to London by the next up-train. He made all sorts of
tipsy promises, but I'd something else to do than listen to him; I told
him to go about his business; and he went off at the front door.'

'He's at the nearest vaults, I'll be bound,' said the first speaker.
'Your money would have gone there too, if you'd been such a fool as to
lend it.'

'Catch me! I knew better what his London meant. Why, he has never paid
me off that five shillings'--and so they went on.

And now all Margaret's anxiety was for the train to come. She hid
herself once more in the ladies' waiting-room, and fancied every noise
was Leonards' step--every loud and boisterous voice was his. But no one
came near her until the train drew up; when she was civilly helped into
a carriage by a porter, into whose face she durst not look till they
were in motion, and then she saw that it was not Leonards'.




CHAPTER XXXIII

PEACE

    'Sleep on, my love, in thy cold bed,
     Never to be disquieted!
     My last Good Night--thou wilt not wake
     Till I thy fate shall overtake.'
             DR. KING.


Home seemed unnaturally quiet after all this terror and noisy commotion.
Her father had seen all due preparation made for her refreshment on her
return; and then sate down again in his accustomed chair, to fall into
one of his sad waking dreams. Dixon had got Mary Higgins to scold and
direct in the kitchen; and her scolding was not the less energetic
because it was delivered in an angry whisper; for, speaking above her
breath she would have thought irreverent, as long as there was any one
dead lying in the house. Margaret had resolved not to mention the
crowning and closing affright to her father. There was no use in
speaking about it; it had ended well; the only thing to be feared was
lest Leonards should in some way borrow money enough to effect his
purpose of following Frederick to London, and hunting him out there. But
there were immense chances against the success of any such plan; and
Margaret determined not to torment herself by thinking of what she could
do nothing to prevent. Frederick would be as much on his guard as she
could put him; and in a day or two at most he would be safely out of
England.

'I suppose we shall hear from Mr. Bell to-morrow,' said Margaret.

'Yes,' replied her father. 'I suppose so.'

'If he can come, he will be here to-morrow evening, I should think.'

'If he cannot come, I shall ask Mr. Thornton to go with me to the
funeral. I cannot go alone. I should break down utterly.'

'Don't ask Mr. Thornton, papa. Let me go with you,' said Margaret,
impetuously.

'You! My dear, women do not generally go.'

'No: because they can't control themselves. Women of our class don't go,
because they have no power over their emotions, and yet are ashamed of
showing them. Poor women go, and don't care if they are seen overwhelmed
with grief. But I promise you, papa, that if you will let me go, I will
be no trouble. Don't have a stranger, and leave me out. Dear papa! if
Mr. Bell cannot come, I shall go. I won't urge my wish against your
will, if he does.'

Mr. Bell could not come. He had the gout. It was a most affectionate
letter, and expressed great and true regret for his inability to attend.
He hoped to come and pay them a visit soon, if they would have him; his
Milton property required some looking after, and his agent had written
to him to say that his presence was absolutely necessary; or else he had
avoided coming near Milton as long as he could, and now the only thing
that would reconcile him to this necessary visit was the idea that he
should see, and might possibly be able to comfort his old friend.

Margaret had all the difficulty in the world to persuade her father not
to invite Mr. Thornton. She had an indescribable repugnance to this step
being taken. The night before the funeral, came a stately note from Mrs.
Thornton to Miss Hale, saying that, at her son's desire, their carriage
should attend the funeral, if it would not be disagreeable to the
family. Margaret tossed the note to her father.

'Oh, don't let us have these forms,' said she. 'Let us go alone--you and
me, papa. They don't care for us, or else he would have offered to go
himself, and not have proposed this sending an empty carriage.'

'I thought you were so extremely averse to his going, Margaret,' said
Mr. Hale in some surprise.

'And so I am. I don't want him to come at all; and I should especially
dislike the idea of our asking him. But this seems such a mockery of
mourning that I did not expect it from him.' She startled her father by
bursting into tears. She had been so subdued in her grief, so thoughtful
for others, so gentle and patient in all things, that he could not
understand her impatient ways to-night; she seemed agitated and
restless; and at all the tenderness which her father in his turn now
lavished upon her, she only cried the more.

She passed so bad a night that she was ill prepared for the additional
anxiety caused by a letter received from Frederick. Mr. Lennox was out
of town; his clerk said that he would return by the following Tuesday at
the latest; that he might possibly be at home on Monday. Consequently,
after some consideration, Frederick had determined upon remaining in
London a day or two longer. He had thought of coming down to Milton
again; the temptation had been very strong; but the idea of Mr. Bell
domesticated in his father's house, and the alarm he had received at the
last moment at the railway station, had made him resolve to stay in
London. Margaret might be assured he would take every precaution against
being tracked by Leonards. Margaret was thankful that she received this
letter while her father was absent in her mother's room. If he had been
present, he would have expected her to read it aloud to him, and it
would have raised in him a state of nervous alarm which she would have
found it impossible to soothe away. There was not merely the fact, which
disturbed her excessively, of Frederick's detention in London, but there
were allusions to the recognition at the last moment at Milton, and the
possibility of a pursuit, which made her blood run cold; and how then
would it have affected her father? Many a time did Margaret repent of
having suggested and urged on the plan of consulting Mr. Lennox. At the
moment, it had seemed as if it would occasion so little delay--add so
little to the apparently small chances of detection; and yet everything
that had since occurred had tended to make it so undesirable. Margaret
battled hard against this regret of hers for what could not now be
helped; this self-reproach for having said what had at the time appeared
to be wise, but which after events were proving to have been so foolish.
But her father was in too depressed a state of mind and body to struggle
healthily; he would succumb to all these causes for morbid regret over
what could not be recalled. Margaret summoned up all her forces to her
aid. Her father seemed to have forgotten that they had any reason to
expect a letter from Frederick that morning. He was absorbed in one
idea--that the last visible token of the presence of his wife was to be
carried away from him, and hidden from his sight. He trembled pitifully
as the undertaker's man was arranging his crape draperies around him. He
looked wistfully at Margaret; and, when released, he tottered towards
her, murmuring, 'Pray for me, Margaret. I have no strength left in me. I
cannot pray. I give her up because I must. I try to bear it: indeed I
do. I know it is God's will. But I cannot see why she died. Pray for me,
Margaret, that I may have faith to pray. It is a great strait, my
child.'

Margaret sat by him in the coach, almost supporting him in her arms; and
repeating all the noble verses of holy comfort, or texts expressive of
faithful resignation, that she could remember. Her voice never faltered;
and she herself gained strength by doing this. Her father's lips moved
after her, repeating the well-known texts as her words suggested them;
it was terrible to see the patient struggling effort to obtain the
resignation which he had not strength to take into his heart as a part
of himself.

Margaret's fortitude nearly gave way as Dixon, with a slight motion of
her hand, directed her notice to Nicholas Higgins and his daughter,
standing a little aloof, but deeply attentive to the ceremonial.
Nicholas wore his usual fustian clothes, but had a bit of black stuff
sewn round his hat--a mark of mourning which he had never shown to his
daughter Bessy's memory. But Mr. Hale saw nothing. He went on repeating
to himself, mechanically as it were, all the funeral service as it was
read by the officiating clergyman; he sighed twice or thrice when all
was ended; and then, putting his hand on Margaret's arm, he mutely
entreated to be led away, as if he were blind, and she his faithful
guide.

Dixon sobbed aloud; she covered her face with her handkerchief, and was
so absorbed in her own grief, that she did not perceive that the crowd,
attracted on such occasions, was dispersing, till she was spoken to by
some one close at hand. It was Mr. Thornton. He had been present all the
time, standing, with bent head, behind a group of people, so that, in
fact, no one had recognised him.

'I beg your pardon,--but, can you tell me how Mr. Hale is? And Miss
Hale, too? I should like to know how they both are.'

'Of course, sir. They are much as is to be expected. Master is terribly
broke down. Miss Hale bears up better than likely.'

Mr. Thornton would rather have heard that she was suffering the natural
sorrow. In the first place, there was selfishness enough in him to have
taken pleasure in the idea that his great love might come in to comfort
and console her; much the same kind of strange passionate pleasure which
comes stinging through a mother's heart, when her drooping infant
nestles close to her, and is dependent upon her for everything. But this
delicious vision of what might have been--in which, in spite of all
Margaret's repulse, he would have indulged only a few days ago--was
miserably disturbed by the recollection of what he had seen near the
Outwood station. 'Miserably disturbed!' that is not strong enough. He
was haunted by the remembrance of the handsome young man, with whom she
stood in an attitude of such familiar confidence; and the remembrance
shot through him like an agony, till it made him clench his hands tight
in order to subdue the pain. At that late hour, so far from home! It
took a great moral effort to galvanise his trust--erewhile so
perfect--in Margaret's pure and exquisite maidenliness, into life; as
soon as the effort ceased, his trust dropped down dead and powerless:
and all sorts of wild fancies chased each other like dreams through his
mind. Here was a little piece of miserable, gnawing confirmation. 'She
bore up better than likely' under this grief. She had then some hope to
look to, so bright that even in her affectionate nature it could come in
to lighten the dark hours of a daughter newly made motherless. Yes! he
knew how she would love. He had not loved her without gaining that
instinctive knowledge of what capabilities were in her. Her soul would
walk in glorious sunlight if any man was worthy, by his power of loving,
to win back her love. Even in her mourning she would rest with a
peaceful faith upon his sympathy. His sympathy! Whose? That other man's.
And that it was another was enough to make Mr. Thornton's pale grave
face grow doubly wan and stern at Dixon's answer.

'I suppose I may call,' said he coldly. 'On Mr. Hale, I mean. He will
perhaps admit me after to-morrow or so.'

He spoke as if the answer were a matter of indifference to him. But it
was not so. For all his pain, he longed to see the author of it.
Although he hated Margaret at times, when he thought of that gentle
familiar attitude and all the attendant circumstances, he had a restless
desire to renew her picture in his mind--a longing for the very
atmosphere she breathed. He was in the Charybdis of passion, and must
perforce circle and circle ever nearer round the fatal centre.

'I dare say, sir, master will see you. He was very sorry to have to deny
you the other day; but circumstances was not agreeable just then.'

For some reason or other, Dixon never named this interview that she had
had with Mr. Thornton to Margaret. It might have been mere chance, but
so it was that Margaret never heard that he had attended her poor
mother's funeral.




CHAPTER XXXIV

FALSE AND TRUE

    'Truth will fail thee never, never!
     Though thy bark be tempest-driven,
     Though each plank be rent and riven,
     Truth will bear thee on for ever!'
             ANON.


The 'bearing up better than likely' was a terrible strain upon Margaret.
Sometimes she thought she must give way, and cry out with pain, as the
sudden sharp thought came across her, even during her apparently
cheerful conversations with her father, that she had no longer a mother.
About Frederick, too, there was great uneasiness. The Sunday post
intervened, and interfered with their London letters; and on Tuesday
Margaret was surprised and disheartened to find that there was still no
letter. She was quite in the dark as to his plans, and her father was
miserable at all this uncertainty. It broke in upon his lately acquired
habit of sitting still in one easy chair for half a day together. He
kept pacing up and down the room; then out of it; and she heard him upon
the landing opening and shutting the bed-room doors, without any
apparent object. She tried to tranquillise him by reading aloud; but it
was evident he could not listen for long together. How thankful she was
then, that she had kept to herself the additional cause for anxiety
produced by their encounter with Leonards. She was thankful to hear Mr.
Thornton announced. His visit would force her father's thoughts into
another channel.

He came up straight to her father, whose hands he took and wrung without
a word--holding them in his for a minute or two, during which time his
face, his eyes, his look, told of more sympathy than could be put into
words. Then he turned to Margaret. Not 'better than likely' did she
look. Her stately beauty was dimmed with much watching and with many
tears. The expression on her countenance was of gentle patient
sadness--nay of positive present suffering. He had not meant to greet
her otherwise than with his late studied coldness of demeanour; but he
could not help going up to her, as she stood a little aside, rendered
timid by the uncertainty of his manner of late, and saying the few
necessary common-place words in so tender a voice, that her eyes filled
with tears, and she turned away to hide her emotion. She took her work
and sate down very quiet and silent. Mr. Thornton's heart beat quick and
strong, and for the time he utterly forgot the Outwood lane. He tried to
talk to Mr. Hale: and--his presence always a certain kind of pleasure to
Mr. Hale, as his power and decision made him, and his opinions, a safe,
sure port--was unusually agreeable to her father, as Margaret saw.

Presently Dixon came to the door and said, 'Miss Hale, you are wanted.'

Dixon's manner was so flurried that Margaret turned sick at heart.
Something had happened to Fred. She had no doubt of that. It was well
that her father and Mr. Thornton were so much occupied by their
conversation.

'What is it, Dixon?' asked Margaret, the moment she had shut the
drawing-room door.

'Come this way, miss,' said Dixon, opening the door of what had been
Mrs. Hale's bed-chamber, now Margaret's, for her father refused to sleep
there again after his wife's death. 'It's nothing, miss,' said Dixon,
choking a little. 'Only a police-inspector. He wants to see you, miss.
But I dare say, it's about nothing at all.'

'Did he name--' asked Margaret, almost inaudibly.

'No, miss; he named nothing. He only asked if you lived here, and if he
could speak to you. Martha went to the door, and let him in; she has
shown him into master's study. I went to him myself, to try if that
would do; but no--it's you, miss, he wants.'

Margaret did not speak again till her hand was on the lock of the study
door. Here she turned round and said, 'Take care papa does not come
down. Mr. Thornton is with him now.'

The inspector was almost daunted by the haughtiness of her manner as she
entered. There was something of indignation expressed in her
countenance, but so kept down and controlled, that it gave her a superb
air of disdain. There was no surprise, no curiosity. She stood awaiting
the opening of his business there. Not a question did she ask.

'I beg your pardon, ma'am, but my duty obliges me to ask you a few plain
questions. A man has died at the Infirmary, in consequence of a fall,
received at Outwood station, between the hours of five and six on
Thursday evening, the twenty-sixth instant. At the time, this fall did
not seem of much consequence; but it was rendered fatal, the doctors
say, by the presence of some internal complaint, and the man's own habit
of drinking.'

The large dark eyes, gazing straight into the inspector's face, dilated
a little. Otherwise there was no motion perceptible to his experienced
observation. Her lips swelled out into a richer curve than ordinary,
owing to the enforced tension of the muscles, but he did not know what
was their usual appearance, so as to recognise the unwonted sullen
defiance of the firm sweeping lines. She never blenched or trembled. She
fixed him with her eye. Now--as he paused before going on, she said,
almost as if she would encourage him in telling his tale--'Well--go on!'

'It is supposed that an inquest will have to be held; there is some
slight evidence to prove that the blow, or push, or scuffle that caused
the fall, was provoked by this poor fellow's half-tipsy impertinence to
a young lady, walking with the man who pushed the deceased over the edge
of the platform. This much was observed by some one on the platform,
who, however, thought no more about the matter, as the blow seemed of
slight consequence. There is also some reason to identify the lady with
yourself; in which case--'

'I was not there,' said Margaret, still keeping her expressionless eyes
fixed on his face, with the unconscious look of a sleep-walker.

The inspector bowed but did not speak. The lady standing before him
showed no emotion, no fluttering fear, no anxiety, no desire to end the
interview. The information he had received was very vague; one of the
porters, rushing out to be in readiness for the train, had seen a
scuffle, at the other end of the platform, between Leonards and a
gentleman accompanied by a lady, but heard no noise; and before the
train had got to its full speed after starting, he had been almost
knocked down by the headlong run of the enraged half intoxicated
Leonards, swearing and cursing awfully. He had not thought any more
about it, till his evidence was routed out by the inspector, who, on
making some farther inquiry at the railroad station, had heard from the
station-master that a young lady and gentleman had been there about that
hour--the lady remarkably handsome--and said, by some grocer's assistant
present at the time, to be a Miss Hale, living at Crampton, whose family
dealt at his shop. There was no certainty that the one lady and
gentleman were identical with the other pair, but there was great
probability. Leonards himself had gone, half-mad with rage and pain, to
the nearest gin-palace for comfort; and his tipsy words had not been
attended to by the busy waiters there; they, however, remembered his
starting up and cursing himself for not having sooner thought of the
electric telegraph, for some purpose unknown; and they believed that he
left with the idea of going there. On his way, overcome by pain or
drink, he had lain down in the road, where the police had found him and
taken him to the Infirmary: there he had never recovered sufficient
consciousness to give any distinct account of his fall, although once or
twice he had had glimmerings of sense sufficient to make the authorities
send for the nearest magistrate, in hopes that he might be able to take
down the dying man's deposition of the cause of his death. But when the
magistrate had come, he was rambling about being at sea, and mixing up
names of captains and lieutenants in an indistinct manner with those of
his fellow porters at the railway; and his last words were a curse on
the 'Cornish trick' which had, he said, made him a hundred pounds poorer
than he ought to have been. The inspector ran all this over in his
mind--the vagueness of the evidence to prove that Margaret had been at
the station--the unflinching, calm denial which she gave to such a
supposition. She stood awaiting his next word with a composure that
appeared supreme.

'Then, madam, I have your denial that you were the lady accompanying the
gentleman who struck the blow, or gave the push, which caused the death
of this poor man?'

A quick, sharp pain went through Margaret's brain. 'Oh God! that I knew
Frederick were safe!' A deep observer of human countenances might have
seen the momentary agony shoot out of her great gloomy eyes, like the
torture of some creature brought to bay. But the inspector though a very
keen, was not a very deep observer. He was a little struck,
notwithstanding, by the form of the answer, which sounded like a
mechanical repetition of her first reply--not changed and modified in
shape so as to meet his last question.

'I was not there,' said she, slowly and heavily. And all this time she
never closed her eyes, or ceased from that glassy, dream-like stare. His
quick suspicions were aroused by this dull echo of her former denial. It
was as if she had forced herself to one untruth, and had been stunned
out of all power of varying it.

He put up his book of notes in a very deliberate manner. Then he looked
up; she had not moved any more than if she had been some great Egyptian
statue.

'I hope you will not think me impertinent when I say, that I may have to
call on you again. I may have to summon you to appear on the inquest,
and prove an alibi, if my witnesses' (it was but one who had recognised
her) 'persist in deposing to your presence at the unfortunate event.' He
looked at her sharply. She was still perfectly quiet--no change of
colour, or darker shadow of guilt, on her proud face. He thought to have
seen her wince: he did not know Margaret Hale. He was a little abashed
by her regal composure. It must have been a mistake of identity. He went
on:

'It is very unlikely, ma'am, that I shall have to do anything of the
kind. I hope you will excuse me for doing what is only my duty, although
it may appear impertinent.'

Margaret bowed her head as he went towards the door. Her lips were stiff
and dry. She could not speak even the common words of farewell. But
suddenly she walked forwards, and opened the study door, and preceded
him to the door of the house, which she threw wide open for his exit.
She kept her eyes upon him in the same dull, fixed manner, until he was
fairly out of the house. She shut the door, and went half-way into the
study; then turned back, as if moved by some passionate impulse, and
locked the door inside.

Then she went into the study, paused--tottered forward--paused
again--swayed for an instant where she stood, and fell prone on the
floor in a dead swoon.




CHAPTER XXXV

EXPIATION

    'There's nought so finely spun
     But it cometh to the sun.'


Mr. Thornton sate on and on. He felt that his company gave pleasure to
Mr. Hale; and was touched by the half-spoken wishful entreaty that he
would remain a little longer--the plaintive 'Don't go yet,' which his
poor friend put forth from time to time. He wondered Margaret did not
return; but it was with no view of seeing her that he lingered. For the
hour--and in the presence of one who was so thoroughly feeling the
nothingness of earth--he was reasonable and self-controlled. He was
deeply interested in all her father said,

    'Of death, and of the heavy lull,
     And of the brain that has grown dull.'

It was curious how the presence of Mr. Thornton had power over Mr. Hale
to make him unlock the secret thoughts which he kept shut up even from
Margaret. Whether it was that her sympathy would be so keen, and show
itself in so lively a manner, that he was afraid of the reaction upon
himself, or whether it was that to his speculative mind all kinds of
doubts presented themselves at such a time, pleading and crying aloud to
be resolved into certainties, and that he knew she would have shrunk
from the expression of any such doubts--nay, from him himself as capable
of conceiving them--whatever was the reason, he could unburden himself
better to Mr. Thornton than to her of all the thoughts and fancies and
fears that had been frost-bound in his brain till now. Mr. Thornton said
very little; but every sentence he uttered added to Mr. Hale's reliance
and regard for him. Was it that he paused in the expression of some
remembered agony, Mr. Thornton's two or three words would complete the
sentence, and show how deeply its meaning was entered into. Was it a
doubt--a fear--a wandering uncertainty seeking rest, but finding
none--so tear-blinded were its eyes--Mr. Thornton, instead of being
shocked, seemed to have passed through that very stage of thought
himself, and could suggest where the exact ray of light was to be found,
which should make the dark places plain. Man of action as he was, busy
in the world's great battle, there was a deeper religion binding him to
God in his heart, in spite of his strong wilfulness, through all his
mistakes, than Mr. Hale had ever dreamed. They never spoke of such
things again, as it happened; but this one conversation made them
peculiar people to each other; knit them together, in a way which no
loose indiscriminate talking about sacred things can ever accomplish.
When all are admitted, how can there be a Holy of Holies?

And all this while, Margaret lay as still and white as death on the
study floor! She had sunk under her burden. It had been heavy in weight
and long carried; and she had been very meek and patient, till all at
once her faith had given way, and she had groped in vain for help! There
was a pitiful contraction of suffering upon her beautiful brows,
although there was no other sign of consciousness remaining. The
mouth--a little while ago, so sullenly projected in defiance--was
relaxed and livid.

    'E par che de la sua labbia si mova
     Uno spirto soave e pien d'amore,
     Chi va dicendo a l'anima: sospira!'

The first symptom of returning life was a quivering about the lips--a
little mute soundless attempt at speech; but the eyes were still closed;
and the quivering sank into stillness. Then, feebly leaning on her arms
for an instant to steady herself, Margaret gathered herself up, and
rose. Her comb had fallen out of her hair; and with an intuitive desire
to efface the traces of weakness, and bring herself into order again,
she sought for it, although from time to time, in the course of the
search, she had to sit down and recover strength. Her head drooped
forwards--her hands meekly laid one upon the other--she tried to recall
the force of her temptation, by endeavouring to remember the details
which had thrown her into such deadly fright; but she could not. She
only understood two facts--that Frederick had been in danger of being
pursued and detected in London, as not only guilty of manslaughter, but
as the more unpardonable leader of the mutiny, and that she had lied to
save him. There was one comfort; her lie had saved him, if only by
gaining some additional time. If the inspector came again to-morrow,
after she had received the letter she longed for to assure her of her
brother's safety, she would brave shame, and stand in her bitter
penance--she, the lofty Margaret--acknowledging before a crowded
justice-room, if need were, that she had been as 'a dog, and done this
thing.' But if he came before she heard from Frederick; if he returned,
as he had half threatened, in a few hours, why! she would tell that lie
again; though how the words would come out, after all this terrible
pause for reflection and self-reproach, without betraying her falsehood,
she did not know, she could not tell. But her repetition of it would
gain time--time for Frederick.

She was roused by Dixon's entrance into the room; she had just been
letting out Mr. Thornton.

He had hardly gone ten steps in the street, before a passing omnibus
stopped close by him, and a man got down, and came up to him, touching
his hat as he did so. It was the police-inspector.

Mr. Thornton had obtained for him his first situation in the police, and
had heard from time to time of the progress of his protege, but they had
not often met, and at first Mr. Thornton did not remember him.

'My name is Watson--George Watson, sir, that you got---- '

'Ah, yes! I recollect. Why you are getting on famously, I hear.'

'Yes, sir. I ought to thank you, sir. But it is on a little matter of
business I made so bold as to speak to you now. I believe you were the
magistrate who attended to take down the deposition of a poor man who
died in the Infirmary last night.'

'Yes,' replied Mr. Thornton. 'I went and heard some kind of a rambling
statement, which the clerk said was of no great use. I'm afraid he was
but a drunken fellow, though there is no doubt he came to his death by
violence at last. One of my mother's servants was engaged to him, I
believe, and she is in great distress to-day. What about him?'

'Why, sir, his death is oddly mixed up with somebody in the house I saw
you coming out of just now; it was a Mr. Hale's, I believe.'

'Yes!' said Mr. Thornton, turning sharp round and looking into the
inspector's face with sudden interest. 'What about it?'

'Why, sir, it seems to me that I have got a pretty distinct chain of
evidence, inculpating a gentleman who was walking with Miss Hale that
night at the Outwood station, as the man who struck or pushed Leonards
off the platform and so caused his death. But the young lady denies that
she was there at the time.'

'Miss Hale denies she was there!' repeated Mr. Thornton, in an altered
voice. 'Tell me, what evening was it? What time?'

'About six o'clock, on the evening of Thursday, the twenty-sixth.'

They walked on, side by side, in silence for a minute or two. The
inspector was the first to speak.

'You see, sir, there is like to be a coroner's inquest; and I've got a
young man who is pretty positive,--at least he was at first;--since he
has heard of the young lady's denial, he says he should not like to
swear; but still he's pretty positive that he saw Miss Hale at the
station, walking about with a gentleman, not five minutes before the
time, when one of the porters saw a scuffle, which he set down to some
of Leonards' impudence--but which led to the fall which caused his
death. And seeing you come out of the very house, sir, I thought I might
make bold to ask if--you see, it's always awkward having to do with
cases of disputed identity, and one doesn't like to doubt the word of a
respectable young woman unless one has strong proof to the contrary.'

'And she denied having been at the station that evening!' repeated Mr.
Thornton, in a low, brooding tone.

'Yes, sir, twice over, as distinct as could be. I told her I should call
again, but seeing you just as I was on my way back from questioning the
young man who said it was her, I thought I would ask your advice, both
as the magistrate who saw Leonards on his death-bed, and as the
gentleman who got me my berth in the force.'

'You were quite right,' said Mr. Thornton. 'Don't take any steps till
you have seen me again.'

'The young lady will expect me to call, from what I said.'

'I only want to delay you an hour. It's now three. Come to my warehouse
at four.'

'Very well, sir!'

And they parted company. Mr. Thornton hurried to his warehouse, and,
sternly forbidding his clerks to allow any one to interrupt him, he went
his way to his own private room, and locked the door. Then he indulged
himself in the torture of thinking it all over, and realising every
detail. How could he have lulled himself into the unsuspicious calm in
which her tearful image had mirrored itself not two hours before, till
he had weakly pitied her and yearned towards her, and forgotten the
savage, distrustful jealousy with which the sight of her--and that
unknown to him--at such an hour--in such a place--had inspired him! How
could one so pure have stooped from her decorous and noble manner of
bearing! But was it decorous--was it? He hated himself for the idea that
forced itself upon him, just for an instant--no more--and yet, while it
was present, thrilled him with its old potency of attraction towards her
image. And then this falsehood--how terrible must be some dread of shame
to be revealed--for, after all, the provocation given by such a man as
Leonards was, when excited by drinking, might, in all probability, be
more than enough to justify any one who came forward to state the
circumstances openly and without reserve! How creeping and deadly that
fear which could bow down the truthful Margaret to falsehood! He could
almost pity her. What would be the end of it? She could not have
considered all she was entering upon; if there was an inquest and the
young man came forward. Suddenly he started up. There should be no
inquest. He would save Margaret. He would take the responsibility of
preventing the inquest, the issue of which, from the uncertainty of the
medical testimony (which he had vaguely heard the night before, from the
surgeon in attendance), could be but doubtful; the doctors had
discovered an internal disease far advanced, and sure to prove fatal;
they had stated that death might have been accelerated by the fall, or
by the subsequent drinking and exposure to cold. If he had but known how
Margaret would have become involved in the affair--if he had but
foreseen that she would have stained her whiteness by a falsehood, he
could have saved her by a word; for the question, of inquest or no
inquest, had hung trembling in the balance only the night before. Miss
Hale might love another--was indifferent and contemptuous to him--but he
would yet do her faithful acts of service of which she should never
know. He might despise her, but the woman whom he had once loved should
be kept from shame; and shame it would be to pledge herself to a lie in
a public court, or otherwise to stand and acknowledge her reason for
desiring darkness rather than light.

Very gray and stern did Mr. Thornton look, as he passed out through his
wondering clerks. He was away about half an hour; and scarcely less
stern did he look when he returned, although his errand had been
successful.

He wrote two lines on a slip of paper, put it in an envelope, and sealed
it up. This he gave to one of the clerks, saying:--

'I appointed Watson--he who was a packer in the warehouse, and who went
into the police--to call on me at four o'clock. I have just met with a
gentleman from Liverpool who wishes to see me before he leaves town.
Take care to give this note to Watson when he calls.'

The note contained these words:

'There will be no inquest. Medical evidence not sufficient to justify
it. Take no further steps. I have not seen the coroner; but I will take
the responsibility.'

'Well,' thought Watson, 'it relieves me from an awkward job. None of my
witnesses seemed certain of anything except the young woman. She was
clear and distinct enough; the porter at the rail-road had seen a
scuffle; or when he found it was likely to bring him in as a witness,
then it might not have been a scuffle, only a little larking, and
Leonards might have jumped off the platform himself;--he would not stick
firm to anything. And Jennings, the grocer's shopman,--well, he was not
quite so bad, but I doubt if I could have got him up to an oath after he
heard that Miss Hale flatly denied it. It would have been a troublesome
job and no satisfaction. And now I must go and tell them they won't be
wanted.'

He accordingly presented himself again at Mr. Hale's that evening. Her
father and Dixon would fain have persuaded Margaret to go to bed; but
they, neither of them, knew the reason for her low continued refusals to
do so. Dixon had learnt part of the truth--but only part. Margaret would
not tell any human being of what she had said, and she did not reveal
the fatal termination to Leonards' fall from the platform. So Dixon
curiosity combined with her allegiance to urge Margaret to go to rest,
which her appearance, as she lay on the sofa, showed but too clearly
that she required. She did not speak except when spoken to; she tried to
smile back in reply to her father's anxious looks and words of tender
enquiry; but, instead of a smile, the wan lips resolved themselves into
a sigh. He was so miserably uneasy that, at last, she consented to go
into her own room, and prepare for going to bed. She was indeed inclined
to give up the idea that the inspector would call again that night, as
it was already past nine o'clock.

She stood by her father, holding on to the back of his chair.

'You will go to bed soon, papa, won't you? Don't sit up alone!'

What his answer was she did not hear; the words were lost in the far
smaller point of sound that magnified itself to her fears, and filled
her brain. There was a low ring at the door-bell.

She kissed her father and glided down stairs, with a rapidity of motion
of which no one would have thought her capable, who had seen her the
minute before. She put aside Dixon.

'Don't come; I will open the door. I know it is him--I can--I must
manage it all myself.'

'As you please, miss!' said Dixon testily; but in a moment afterwards,
she added, 'But you're not fit for it. You are more dead than alive.'

'Am I?' said Margaret, turning round and showing her eyes all aglow with
strange fire, her cheeks flushed, though her lips were baked and livid
still.

She opened the door to the Inspector, and preceded him into the study.
She placed the candle on the table, and snuffed it carefully, before she
turned round and faced him.

'You are late!' said she. 'Well?' She held her breath for the answer.

'I'm sorry to have given any unnecessary trouble, ma'am; for, after all,
they've given up all thoughts of holding an inquest. I have had other
work to do and other people to see, or I should have been here before
now.'

'Then it is ended,' said Margaret. 'There is to be no further enquiry.'

'I believe I've got Mr. Thornton's note about me,' said the Inspector,
fumbling in his pocket-book.

'Mr. Thornton's!' said Margaret.

'Yes! he's a magistrate--ah! here it is.' She could not see to read
it--no, not although she was close to the candle. The words swam before
her. But she held it in her hand, and looked at it as if she were
intently studying it.

'I'm sure, ma'am, it's a great weight off my mind; for the evidence was
so uncertain, you see, that the man had received any blow at all,--and
if any question of identity came in, it so complicated the case, as I
told Mr. Thornton--'

'Mr. Thornton!' said Margaret, again.

'I met him this morning, just as he was coming out of this house, and,
as he's an old friend of mine, besides being the magistrate who saw
Leonards last night, I made bold to tell him of my difficulty.'

Margaret sighed deeply. She did not want to hear any more; she was
afraid alike of what she had heard, and of what she might hear. She
wished that the man would go. She forced herself to speak.

'Thank you for calling. It is very late. I dare say it is past ten
o'clock. Oh! here is the note!' she continued, suddenly interpreting the
meaning of the hand held out to receive it. He was putting it up, when
she said, 'I think it is a cramped, dazzling sort of writing. I could
not read it; will you just read it to me?'

He read it aloud to her.

'Thank you. You told Mr. Thornton that I was not there?'

'Oh, of course, ma'am. I'm sorry now that I acted upon information,
which seems to have been so erroneous. At first the young man was so
positive; and now he says that he doubted all along, and hopes that his
mistake won't have occasioned you such annoyance as to lose their shop
your custom. Good night, ma'am.'

'Good night.' She rang the bell for Dixon to show him out. As Dixon
returned up the passage Margaret passed her swiftly.

'It is all right!' said she, without looking at Dixon; and before the
woman could follow her with further questions she had sped up-stairs,
and entered her bed-chamber, and bolted her door.

She threw herself, dressed as she was, upon her bed. She was too much
exhausted to think. Half an hour or more elapsed before the cramped
nature of her position, and the chilliness, supervening upon great
fatigue, had the power to rouse her numbed faculties. Then she began to
recall, to combine, to wonder. The first idea that presented itself to
her was, that all this sickening alarm on Frederick's behalf was over;
that the strain was past. The next was a wish to remember every word of
the Inspector's which related to Mr. Thornton. When had he seen him?
What had he said? What had Mr. Thornton done? What were the exact words
of his note? And until she could recollect, even to the placing or
omitting an article, the very expressions which he had used in the note,
her mind refused to go on with its progress. But the next conviction she
came to was clear enough;--Mr. Thornton had seen her close to Outwood
station on the fatal Thursday night, and had been told of her denial
that she was there. She stood as a liar in his eyes. She was a liar. But
she had no thought of penitence before God; nothing but chaos and night
surrounded the one lurid fact that, in Mr. Thornton's eyes, she was
degraded. She cared not to think, even to herself, of how much of excuse
she might plead. That had nothing to do with Mr. Thornton; she never
dreamed that he, or any one else, could find cause for suspicion in what
was so natural as her accompanying her brother; but what was really
false and wrong was known to him, and he had a right to judge her. 'Oh,
Frederick! Frederick!' she cried, 'what have I not sacrificed for you!'
Even when she fell asleep her thoughts were compelled to travel the same
circle, only with exaggerated and monstrous circumstances of pain.

When she awoke a new idea flashed upon her with all the brightness of
the morning. Mr. Thornton had learnt her falsehood before he went to the
coroner; that suggested the thought, that he had possibly been
influenced so to do with a view of sparing her the repetition of her
denial. But she pushed this notion on one side with the sick wilfulness
of a child. If it were so, she felt no gratitude to him, as it only
showed her how keenly he must have seen that she was disgraced already,
before he took such unwonted pains to spare her any further trial of
truthfulness, which had already failed so signally. She would have gone
through the whole--she would have perjured herself to save Frederick,
rather--far rather--than Mr. Thornton should have had the knowledge that
prompted him to interfere to save her. What ill-fate brought him in
contact with the Inspector? What made him be the very magistrate sent
for to receive Leonards' deposition? What had Leonards said? How much of
it was intelligible to Mr. Thornton, who might already, for aught she
knew, be aware of the old accusation against Frederick, through their
mutual friend, Mr. Bell? If so, he had striven to save the son, who came
in defiance of the law to attend his mother's death-bed. And under this
idea she could feel grateful--not yet, if ever she should, if his
interference had been prompted by contempt. Oh! had any one such just
cause to feel contempt for her? Mr. Thornton, above all people, on whom
she had looked down from her imaginary heights till now! She suddenly
found herself at his feet, and was strangely distressed at her fall. She
shrank from following out the premises to their conclusion, and so
acknowledging to herself how much she valued his respect and good
opinion. Whenever this idea presented itself to her at the end of a long
avenue of thoughts, she turned away from following that path--she would
not believe in it.

It was later than she fancied, for in the agitation of the previous
night, she had forgotten to wind up her watch; and Mr. Hale had given
especial orders that she was not to be disturbed by the usual awakening.
By and by the door opened cautiously, and Dixon put her head in.
Perceiving that Margaret was awake, she came forwards with a letter.

'Here's something to do you good, miss. A letter from Master Frederick.'

'Thank you, Dixon. How late it is!'

She spoke very languidly, and suffered Dixon to lay it on the
counterpane before her, without putting out a hand to take it.

'You want your breakfast, I'm sure. I will bring it you in a minute.
Master has got the tray all ready, I know.'

Margaret did not reply; she let her go; she felt that she must be alone
before she could open that letter. She opened it at last. The first
thing that caught her eye was the date two days earlier than she
received it. He had then written when he had promised, and their alarm
might have been spared. But she would read the letter and see. It was
hasty enough, but perfectly satisfactory. He had seen Henry Lennox, who
knew enough of the case to shake his head over it, in the first
instance, and tell him he had done a very daring thing in returning to
England, with such an accusation, backed by such powerful influence,
hanging over him. But when they had come to talk it over, Mr. Lennox had
acknowledged that there might be some chance of his acquittal, if he
could but prove his statements by credible witnesses--that in such case
it might be worth while to stand his trial, otherwise it would be a
great risk. He would examine--he would take every pains. 'It struck me'
said Frederick, 'that your introduction, little sister of mine, went a
long way. Is it so? He made many inquiries, I can assure you. He seemed
a sharp, intelligent fellow, and in good practice too, to judge from the
signs of business and the number of clerks about him. But these may be
only lawyer's dodges. I have just caught a packet on the point of
sailing--I am off in five minutes. I may have to come back to England
again on this business, so keep my visit secret. I shall send my father
some rare old sherry, such as you cannot buy in England,--(such stuff as
I've got in the bottle before me)! He needs something of the kind--my
dear love to him--God bless him. I'm sure--here's my cab. P.S.--What an
escape that was! Take care you don't breathe of my having been--not even
to the Shaws.'

Margaret turned to the envelope; it was marked 'Too late.' The letter
had probably been trusted to some careless waiter, who had forgotten to
post it. Oh! what slight cobwebs of chances stand between us and
Temptation! Frederick had been safe, and out of England twenty, nay,
thirty hours ago; and it was only about seventeen hours since she had
told a falsehood to baffle pursuit, which even then would have been
vain. How faithless she had been! Where now was her proud motto, 'Fais
ce que dois, advienne que pourra?' If she had but dared to bravely tell
the truth as regarded herself, defying them to find out what she refused
to tell concerning another, how light of heart she would now have felt!
Not humbled before God, as having failed in trust towards Him; not
degraded and abased in Mr. Thornton's sight. She caught herself up at
this with a miserable tremor; here was she classing his low opinion of
her alongside with the displeasure of God. How was it that he haunted
her imagination so persistently? What could it be? Why did she care for
what he thought, in spite of all her pride in spite of herself? She
believed that she could have borne the sense of Almighty displeasure,
because He knew all, and could read her penitence, and hear her cries
for help in time to come. But Mr. Thornton--why did she tremble, and
hide her face in the pillow? What strong feeling had overtaken her at
last?

She sprang out of bed and prayed long and earnestly. It soothed and
comforted her so to open her heart. But as soon as she reviewed her
position she found the sting was still there; that she was not good
enough, nor pure enough to be indifferent to the lowered opinion of a
fellow creature; that the thought of how he must be looking upon her
with contempt, stood between her and her sense of wrong-doing. She took
her letter in to her father as soon as she was drest. There was so
slight an allusion to their alarm at the rail-road station, that Mr.
Hale passed over it without paying any attention to it. Indeed, beyond
the mere fact of Frederick having sailed undiscovered and unsuspected,
he did not gather much from the letter at the time, he was so uneasy
about Margaret's pallid looks. She seemed continually on the point of
weeping.

'You are sadly overdone, Margaret. It is no wonder. But you must let me
nurse you now.'

He made her lie down on the sofa, and went for a shawl to cover her
with. His tenderness released her tears; and she cried bitterly.

'Poor child!--poor child!' said he, looking fondly at her, as she lay
with her face to the wall, shaking with her sobs. After a while they
ceased, and she began to wonder whether she durst give herself the
relief of telling her father of all her trouble. But there were more
reasons against it than for it. The only one for it was the relief to
herself; and against it was the thought that it would add materially to
her father's nervousness, if it were indeed necessary for Frederick to
come to England again; that he would dwell on the circumstance of his
son's having caused the death of a man, however unwittingly and
unwillingly; that this knowledge would perpetually recur to trouble him,
in various shapes of exaggeration and distortion from the simple truth.
And about her own great fault--he would be distressed beyond measure at
her want of courage and faith, yet perpetually troubled to make excuses
for her. Formerly Margaret would have come to him as priest as well as
father, to tell him of her temptation and her sin; but latterly they had
not spoken much on such subjects; and she knew not how, in his change of
opinions, he would reply if the depth of her soul called unto his. No;
she would keep her secret, and bear the burden alone. Alone she would go
before God, and cry for His absolution. Alone she would endure her
disgraced position in the opinion of Mr. Thornton. She was unspeakably
touched by the tender efforts of her father to think of cheerful
subjects on which to talk, and so to take her thoughts away from
dwelling on all that had happened of late. It was some months since he
had been so talkative as he was this day. He would not let her sit up,
and offended Dixon desperately by insisting on waiting upon her himself.

At last she smiled; a poor, weak little smile; but it gave him the
truest pleasure.

'It seems strange to think, that what gives us most hope for the future
should be called Dolores,' said Margaret. The remark was more in
character with her father than with her usual self; but to-day they
seemed to have changed natures.

'Her mother was a Spaniard, I believe: that accounts for her religion.
Her father was a stiff Presbyterian when I knew him. But it is a very
soft and pretty name.'

'How young she is!--younger by fourteen months than I am. Just the age
that Edith was when she was engaged to Captain Lennox. Papa, we will go
and see them in Spain.'

He shook his head. But he said, 'If you wish it, Margaret. Only let us
come back here. It would seem unfair--unkind to your mother, who always,
I'm afraid, disliked Milton so much, if we left it now she is lying
here, and cannot go with us. No, dear; you shall go and see them, and
bring me back a report of my Spanish daughter.'

'No, papa, I won't go without you. Who is to take care of you when I am
gone?'

'I should like to know which of us is taking care of the other. But if
you went, I should persuade Mr. Thornton to let me give him double
lessons. We would work up the classics famously. That would be a
perpetual interest. You might go on, and see Edith at Corfu, if you
liked.'

Margaret did not speak all at once. Then she said rather gravely: 'Thank
you, papa. But I don't want to go. We will hope that Mr. Lennox will
manage so well, that Frederick may bring Dolores to see us when they are
married. And as for Edith, the regiment won't remain much longer in
Corfu. Perhaps we shall see both of them here before another year is
out.'

Mr. Hale's cheerful subjects had come to an end. Some painful
recollection had stolen across his mind, and driven him into silence.
By-and-by Margaret said:

'Papa--did you see Nicholas Higgins at the funeral? He was there, and
Mary too. Poor fellow! it was his way of showing sympathy. He has a good
warm heart under his bluff abrupt ways.'

'I am sure of it,' replied Mr. Hale. 'I saw it all along, even while you
tried to persuade me that he was all sorts of bad things. We will go and
see them to-morrow, if you are strong enough to walk so far.'

'Oh yes. I want to see them. We did not pay Mary--or rather she refused
to take it, Dixon says. We will go so as to catch him just after his
dinner, and before he goes to his work.'

Towards evening Mr. Hale said:

'I half expected Mr. Thornton would have called. He spoke of a book
yesterday which he had, and which I wanted to see. He said he would try
and bring it to-day.'

Margaret sighed. She knew he would not come. He would be too delicate to
run the chance of meeting her, while her shame must be so fresh in his
memory. The very mention of his name renewed her trouble, and produced a
relapse into the feeling of depressed, pre-occupied exhaustion. She gave
way to listless languor. Suddenly it struck her that this was a strange
manner to show her patience, or to reward her father for his watchful
care of her all through the day. She sate up and offered to read aloud.
His eyes were failing, and he gladly accepted her proposal. She read
well: she gave the due emphasis; but had any one asked her, when she had
ended, the meaning of what she had been reading, she could not have
told. She was smitten with a feeling of ingratitude to Mr. Thornton,
inasmuch as, in the morning, she had refused to accept the kindness he
had shown her in making further inquiry from the medical men, so as to
obviate any inquest being held. Oh! she was grateful! She had been
cowardly and false, and had shown her cowardliness and falsehood in
action that could not be recalled; but she was not ungrateful. It sent a
glow to her heart, to know how she could feel towards one who had reason
to despise her. His cause for contempt was so just, that she should have
respected him less if she had thought he did not feel contempt. It was a
pleasure to feel how thoroughly she respected him. He could not prevent
her doing that; it was the one comfort in all this misery.

Late in the evening, the expected book arrived, 'with Mr. Thornton's
kind regards, and wishes to know how Mr. Hale is.'

'Say that I am much better, Dixon, but that Miss Hale--'

'No, papa,' said Margaret, eagerly--'don't say anything about me. He
does not ask.'

'My dear child, how you are shivering!' said her father, a few minutes
afterwards. 'You must go to bed directly. You have turned quite pale!'

Margaret did not refuse to go, though she was loth to leave her father
alone. She needed the relief of solitude after a day of busy thinking,
and busier repenting.

But she seemed much as usual the next day; the lingering gravity and
sadness, and the occasional absence of mind, were not unnatural symptoms
in the early days of grief. And almost in proportion to her
re-establishment in health, was her father's relapse into his abstracted
musing upon the wife he had lost, and the past era in his life that was
closed to him for ever.




CHAPTER XXXVI

UNION NOT ALWAYS STRENGTH

    'The steps of the bearers, heavy and slow,
     The sobs of the mourners, deep and low.'
             SHELLEY.


At the time arranged the previous day, they set out on their walk to see
Nicholas Higgins and his daughter. They both were reminded of their
recent loss, by a strange kind of shyness in their new habiliments, and
in the fact that it was the first time, for many weeks, that they had
deliberately gone out together. They drew very close to each other in
unspoken sympathy.

Nicholas was sitting by the fire-side in his accustomed corner: but he
had not his accustomed pipe. He was leaning his head upon his hand, his
arm resting on his knee. He did not get up when he saw them, though
Margaret could read the welcome in his eye.

'Sit ye down, sit ye down. Fire's welly out,' said he, giving it a
vigorous poke, as if to turn attention away from himself. He was rather
disorderly, to be sure, with a black unshaven beard of several days'
growth, making his pale face look yet paler, and a jacket which would
have been all the better for patching.

'We thought we should have a good chance of finding you, just after
dinner-time,' said Margaret.

'We have had our sorrow too, since we saw you,' said Mr. Hale.

'Ay, ay. Sorrows is more plentiful than dinners just now; I reckon, my
dinner hour stretches all o'er the day; yo're pretty sure of finding
me.'

'Are you out of work?' asked Margaret.

'Ay,' he replied shortly. Then, after a moment's silence, he added,
looking up for the first time: 'I'm not wanting brass. Dunno yo' think
it. Bess, poor lass, had a little stock under her pillow, ready to slip
into my hand, last moment, and Mary is fustian-cutting. But I'm out o'
work a' the same.'

'We owe Mary some money,' said Mr. Hale, before Margaret's sharp
pressure on his arm could arrest the words.

'If hoo takes it, I'll turn her out o' doors. I'll bide inside these
four walls, and she'll bide out. That's a'.'

'But we owe her many thanks for her kind service,' began Mr. Hale again.

'I ne'er thanked yo'r daughter theer for her deeds o' love to my poor
wench. I ne'er could find th' words. I'se have to begin and try now, if
yo' start making an ado about what little Mary could sarve yo'.'

'Is it because of the strike you're out of work?' asked Margaret gently.

'Strike's ended. It's o'er for this time. I'm out o' work because I
ne'er asked for it. And I ne'er asked for it, because good words is
scarce, and bad words is plentiful.'

He was in a mood to take a surly pleasure in giving answers that were
like riddles. But Margaret saw that he would like to be asked for the
explanation.

'And good words are--?'

'Asking for work. I reckon them's almost the best words that men can
say. "Gi' me work" means "and I'll do it like a man." Them's good
words.'

'And bad words are refusing you work when you ask for it.'

'Ay. Bad words is saying "Aha, my fine chap! Yo've been true to yo'r
order, and I'll be true to mine. Yo' did the best yo' could for them as
wanted help; that's yo'r way of being true to yo'r kind; and I'll be
true to mine. Yo've been a poor fool, as knowed no better nor be a true
faithful fool. So go and be d---- d to yo'. There's no work for yo'
here." Them's bad words. I'm not a fool; and if I was, folk ought to ha'
taught me how to be wise after their fashion. I could mappen ha' learnt,
if any one had tried to teach me.'

'Would it not be worth while,' said Mr. Hale, 'to ask your old master if
he would take you back again? It might be a poor chance, but it would be
a chance.'

He looked up again, with a sharp glance at the questioner; and then
tittered a low and bitter laugh.

'Measter! if it's no offence, I'll ask yo' a question or two in my
turn.'

'You're quite welcome,' said Mr. Hale.

'I reckon yo'n some way of earning your bread. Folk seldom lives i'
Milton just for pleasure, if they can live anywhere else.'

'You are quite right. I have some independent property, but my intention
in settling in Milton was to become a private tutor.'

'To teach folk. Well! I reckon they pay yo' for teaching them, dunnot
they?'

'Yes,' replied Mr. Hale, smiling. 'I teach in order to get paid.'

'And them that pays yo', dun they tell yo' whatten to do, or whatten not
to do wi' the money they gives you in just payment for your pains--in
fair exchange like?'

'No; to be sure not!'

'They dunnot say, "Yo' may have a brother, or a friend as dear as a
brother, who wants this here brass for a purpose both yo' and he think
right; but yo' mun promise not give it to him. Yo' may see a good use,
as yo' think, to put yo'r money to; but we don't think it good, and so
if yo' spend it a-thatens we'll just leave off dealing with yo'." They
dunnot say that, dun they?'

'No: to be sure not!'

'Would yo' stand it if they did?'

'It would be some very hard pressure that would make me even think of
submitting to such dictation.'

'There's not the pressure on all the broad earth that would make me,
said Nicholas Higgins. 'Now yo've got it. Yo've hit the bull's eye.
Hamper's--that's where I worked--makes their men pledge 'emselves
they'll not give a penny to help th' Union or keep turnouts fro'
clemming. They may pledge and make pledge,' continued he, scornfully;
'they nobbut make liars and hypocrites. And that's a less sin, to my
mind, to making men's hearts so hard that they'll not do a kindness to
them as needs it, or help on the right and just cause, though it goes
again the strong hand. But I'll ne'er forswear mysel' for a' the work
the king could gi'e me. I'm a member o' the Union; and I think it's the
only thing to do the workman any good. And I've been a turn-out, and
known what it were to clem; so if I get a shilling, sixpence shall go to
them if they axe it from me. Consequence is, I dunnot see where I'm to
get a shilling.'

'Is that rule about not contributing to the Union in force at all the
mills?' asked Margaret.

'I cannot say. It's a new regulation at ourn; and I reckon they'll find
that they cannot stick to it. But it's in force now. By-and-by they'll
find out, tyrants makes liars.'

There was a little pause. Margaret was hesitating whether she should say
what was in her mind; she was unwilling to irritate one who was already
gloomy and despondent enough. At last out it came. But in her soft
tones, and with her reluctant manner, showing that she was unwilling to
say anything unpleasant, it did not seem to annoy Higgins, only to
perplex him.

'Do you remember poor Boucher saying that the Union was a tyrant? I
think he said it was the worst tyrant of all. And I remember at the time
I agreed with him.'

It was a long while before he spoke. He was resting his head on his two
hands, and looking down into the fire, so she could not read the
expression on his face.

'I'll not deny but what th' Union finds it necessary to force a man into
his own good. I'll speak truth. A man leads a dree life who's not i' th'
Union. But once i' the' Union, his interests are taken care on better
nor he could do it for himsel', or by himsel', for that matter. It's the
only way working men can get their rights, by all joining together. More
the members, more chance for each one separate man having justice done
him. Government takes care o' fools and madmen; and if any man is
inclined to do himsel' or his neighbour a hurt, it puts a bit of a check
on him, whether he likes it or no. That's all we do i' th' Union. We
can't clap folk into prison; but we can make a man's life so heavy to be
borne, that he's obliged to come in, and be wise and helpful in spite of
himself. Boucher were a fool all along, and ne'er a worse fool than at
th' last.'

'He did you harm?' asked Margaret.

'Ay, that did he. We had public opinion on our side, till he and his
sort began rioting and breaking laws. It were all o'er wi' the strike
then.'

'Then would it not have been far better to have left him alone, and not
forced him to join the Union? He did you no good; and you drove him
mad.'

'Margaret,' said her father, in a low and warning tone, for he saw the
cloud gathering on Higgins's face.

'I like her,' said Higgins, suddenly. 'Hoo speaks plain out what's in
her mind. Hoo doesn't comprehend th' Union for all that. It's a great
power: it's our only power. I ha' read a bit o' poetry about a plough
going o'er a daisy, as made tears come into my eyes, afore I'd other
cause for crying. But the chap ne'er stopped driving the plough, I'se
warrant, for all he were pitiful about the daisy. He'd too much
mother-wit for that. Th' Union's the plough, making ready the land for
harvest-time. Such as Boucher--'twould be settin' him up too much to
liken him to a daisy; he's liker a weed lounging over the ground--mun
just make up their mind to be put out o' the way. I'm sore vexed wi' him
just now. So, mappen, I dunnot speak him fair. I could go o'er him wi' a
plough mysel', wi' a' the pleasure in life.'

'Why? What has he been doing? Anything fresh?'

'Ay, to be sure. He's ne'er out o' mischief, that man. First of a' he
must go raging like a mad fool, and kick up yon riot. Then he'd to go
into hiding, where he'd a been yet, if Thornton had followed him out as
I'd hoped he would ha' done. But Thornton, having got his own purpose,
didn't care to go on wi' the prosecution for the riot. So Boucher slunk
back again to his house. He ne'er showed himsel' abroad for a day or
two. He had that grace. And then, where think ye that he went? Why, to
Hamper's. Damn him! He went wi' his mealy-mouthed face, that turns me
sick to look at, a-asking for work, though he knowed well enough the new
rule, o' pledging themselves to give nought to th' Unions; nought to
help the starving turn-out! Why he'd a clemmed to death, if th' Union
had na helped him in his pinch. There he went, ossing to promise aught,
and pledge himsel' to aught--to tell a' he know'd on our proceedings,
the good-for-nothing Judas! But I'll say this for Hamper, and thank him
for it at my dying day, he drove Boucher away, and would na listen to
him--ne'er a word--though folk standing by, says the traitor cried like
a babby!'

'Oh! how shocking! how pitiful!' exclaimed Margaret. 'Higgins, I don't
know you to-day. Don't you see how you've made Boucher what he is, by
driving him into the Union against his will--without his heart going
with it. You have made him what he is!'

Made him what he is! What was he?

Gathering, gathering along the narrow street, came a hollow, measured
sound; now forcing itself on their attention. Many voices were hushed
and low: many steps were heard not moving onwards, at least not with any
rapidity or steadiness of motion, but as if circling round one spot.
Yes, there was one distinct, slow tramp of feet, which made itself a
clear path through the air, and reached their ears; the measured
laboured walk of men carrying a heavy burden. They were all drawn
towards the house-door by some irresistible impulse; impelled
thither--not by a poor curiosity, but as if by some solemn blast.

Six men walked in the middle of the road, three of them being policemen.
They carried a door, taken off its hinges, upon their shoulders, on
which lay some dead human creature; and from each side of the door there
were constant droppings. All the street turned out to see, and, seeing,
to accompany the procession, each one questioning the bearers, who
answered almost reluctantly at last, so often had they told the tale.

'We found him i' th' brook in the field beyond there.'

'Th' brook!--why there's not water enough to drown him!'

'He was a determined chap. He lay with his face downwards. He was sick
enough o' living, choose what cause he had for it.'

Higgins crept up to Margaret's side, and said in a weak piping kind of
voice: 'It's not John Boucher? He had na spunk enough. Sure! It's not
John Boucher! Why, they are a' looking this way! Listen! I've a singing
in my head, and I cannot hear.'

They put the door down carefully upon the stones, and all might see the
poor drowned wretch--his glassy eyes, one half-open, staring right
upwards to the sky. Owing to the position in which he had been found
lying, his face was swollen and discoloured besides, his skin was
stained by the water in the brook, which had been used for dyeing
purposes. The fore part of his head was bald; but the hair grew thin and
long behind, and every separate lock was a conduit for water. Through
all these disfigurements, Margaret recognised John Boucher. It seemed to
her so sacrilegious to be peering into that poor distorted, agonised
face, that, by a flash of instinct, she went forwards and softly covered
the dead man's countenance with her handkerchief. The eyes that saw her
do this followed her, as she turned away from her pious office, and were
thus led to the place where Nicholas Higgins stood, like one rooted to
the spot. The men spoke together, and then one of them came up to
Higgins, who would have fain shrunk back into his house.

'Higgins, thou knowed him! Thou mun go tell the wife. Do it gently, man,
but do it quick, for we canna leave him here long.'

'I canna go,' said Higgins. 'Dunnot ask me. I canna face her.'

'Thou knows her best,' said the man. 'We'n done a deal in bringing him
here--thou take thy share.'

'I canna do it,' said Higgins. 'I'm welly felled wi' seeing him. We
wasn't friends; and now he's dead.'

'Well, if thou wunnot thou wunnot. Some one mun, though. It's a dree
task; but it's a chance, every minute, as she doesn't hear on it in some
rougher way nor a person going to make her let on by degrees, as it
were.'

'Papa, do you go,' said Margaret, in a low voice.

'If I could--if I had time to think of what I had better say; but all at
once---- ' Margaret saw that her father was indeed unable. He was
trembling from head to foot.

'I will go,' said she.

'Bless yo', miss, it will be a kind act; for she's been but a sickly
sort of body, I hear, and few hereabouts know much on her.'

Margaret knocked at the closed door; but there was such a noise, as of
many little ill-ordered children, that she could hear no reply; indeed,
she doubted if she was heard, and as every moment of delay made her
recoil from her task more and more, she opened the door and went in,
shutting it after her, and even, unseen to the woman, fastening the
bolt.

Mrs. Boucher was sitting in a rocking-chair, on the other side of the
ill-redd-up fireplace; it looked as if the house had been untouched for
days by any effort at cleanliness.

Margaret said something, she hardly knew what, her throat and mouth were
so dry, and the children's noise completely prevented her from being
heard. She tried again.

'How are you, Mrs. Boucher? But very poorly, I'm afraid.'

'I've no chance o' being well,' said she querulously. 'I'm left alone to
manage these childer, and nought for to give 'em for to keep 'em quiet.
John should na ha' left me, and me so poorly.'

'How long is it since he went away?'

'Four days sin'. No one would give him work here, and he'd to go on
tramp toward Greenfield. But he might ha' been back afore this, or sent
me some word if he'd getten work. He might---- '

'Oh, don't blame him,' said Margaret. 'He felt it deeply, I'm sure---- '

'Willto' hold thy din, and let me hear the lady speak!' addressing
herself, in no very gentle voice, to a little urchin of about a year
old. She apologetically continued to Margaret, 'He's always mithering me
for "daddy" and "butty;" and I ha' no butties to give him, and daddy's
away, and forgotten us a', I think. He's his father's darling, he is,'
said she, with a sudden turn of mood, and, dragging the child up to her
knee, she began kissing it fondly.

Margaret laid her hand on the woman's arm to arrest her attention. Their
eyes met.

'Poor little fellow!' said Margaret, slowly; 'he _was_ his father's
darling.'

'He _is_ his father's darling,' said the woman, rising hastily, and
standing face to face with Margaret. Neither of them spoke for a moment
or two. Then Mrs. Boucher began in a low, growling tone, gathering in
wildness as she went on: 'He _is_ his father's darling, I say. Poor folk
can love their childer as well as rich. Why dunno yo' speak? Why dun yo'
stare at me wi' your great pitiful eyes? Where's John?' Weak as she was,
she shook Margaret to force out an answer. 'Oh, my God!' said she,
understanding the meaning of that tearful look. She sank back into the
chair. Margaret took up the child and put him into her arms.

'He loved him,' said she.

'Ay,' said the woman, shaking her head, 'he loved us a'. We had some one
to love us once. It's a long time ago; but when he were in life and with
us, he did love us, he did. He loved this babby mappen the best on us;
but he loved me and I loved him, though I was calling him five minutes
agone. Are yo' sure he's dead?' said she, trying to get up. 'If it's
only that he's ill and like to die, they may bring him round yet. I'm
but an ailing creature mysel'--I've been ailing this long time.'

'But he is dead--he is drowned!'

'Folk are brought round after they're dead-drowned. Whatten was I
thinking of, to sit still when I should be stirring mysel'? Here, whisth
thee, child--whisth thee! tak' this, tak' aught to play wi', but dunnot
cry while my heart's breaking! Oh, where is my strength gone to? Oh,
John--husband!'

Margaret saved her from falling by catching her in her arms. She sate
down in the rocking chair, and held the woman upon her knees, her head
lying on Margaret's shoulder. The other children, clustered together in
affright, began to understand the mystery of the scene; but the ideas
came slowly, for their brains were dull and languid of perception. They
set up such a cry of despair as they guessed the truth, that Margaret
knew not how to bear it. Johnny's cry was loudest of them all, though he
knew not why he cried, poor little fellow.

The mother quivered as she lay in Margaret's arms. Margaret heard a
noise at the door.

'Open it. Open it quick,' said she to the eldest child. 'It's bolted;
make no noise--be very still. Oh, papa, let them go upstairs very softly
and carefully, and perhaps she will not hear them. She has
fainted--that's all.'

'It's as well for her, poor creature,' said a woman following in the
wake of the bearers of the dead. 'But yo're not fit to hold her. Stay,
I'll run fetch a pillow and we'll let her down easy on the floor.'

This helpful neighbour was a great relief to Margaret; she was evidently
a stranger to the house, a new-comer in the district, indeed; but she
was so kind and thoughtful that Margaret felt she was no longer needed;
and that it would be better, perhaps, to set an example of clearing the
house, which was filled with idle, if sympathising gazers.

She looked round for Nicholas Higgins. He was not there. So she spoke to
the woman who had taken the lead in placing Mrs. Boucher on the floor.

'Can you give all these people a hint that they had better leave in
quietness? So that when she comes round, she should only find one or two
that she knows about her. Papa, will you speak to the men, and get them
to go away? She cannot breathe, poor thing, with this crowd about her.'

Margaret was kneeling down by Mrs. Boucher and bathing her face with
vinegar; but in a few minutes she was surprised at the gush of fresh
air. She looked round, and saw a smile pass between her father and the
woman.

'What is it?' asked she.

'Only our good friend here,' replied her father, 'hit on a capital
expedient for clearing the place.'

'I bid 'em begone, and each take a child with 'em, and to mind that they
were orphans, and their mother a widow. It was who could do most, and
the childer are sure of a bellyful to-day, and of kindness too. Does hoo
know how he died?'

'No,' said Margaret; 'I could not tell her all at once.'

'Hoo mun be told because of th' Inquest. See! Hoo's coming round; shall
you or I do it? or mappen your father would be best?'

'No; you, you,' said Margaret.

They awaited her perfect recovery in silence. Then the neighbour woman
sat down on the floor, and took Mrs. Boucher's head and shoulders on her
lap.

'Neighbour,' said she, 'your man is dead. Guess yo' how he died?'

'He were drowned,' said Mrs. Boucher, feebly, beginning to cry for the
first time, at this rough probing of her sorrows.

'He were found drowned. He were coming home very hopeless o' aught on
earth. He thought God could na be harder than men; mappen not so hard;
mappen as tender as a mother; mappen tenderer. I'm not saying he did
right, and I'm not saying he did wrong. All I say is, may neither me nor
mine ever have his sore heart, or we may do like things.'

'He has left me alone wi' a' these children!' moaned the widow, less
distressed at the manner of the death than Margaret expected; but it was
of a piece with her helpless character to feel his loss as principally
affecting herself and her children.

'Not alone,' said Mr. Hale, solemnly. 'Who is with you? Who will take up
your cause?' The widow opened her eyes wide, and looked at the new
speaker, of whose presence she had not been aware till then.

'Who has promised to be a father to the fatherless?' continued he.

'But I've getten six children, sir, and the eldest not eight years of
age. I'm not meaning for to doubt His power, sir,--only it needs a deal
o' trust;' and she began to cry afresh.

'Hoo'll be better able to talk to-morrow, sir,' said the neighbour.
'Best comfort now would be the feel of a child at her heart. I'm sorry
they took the babby.'

'I'll go for it,' said Margaret. And in a few minutes she returned,
carrying Johnnie, his face all smeared with eating, and his hands loaded
with treasures in the shape of shells, and bits of crystal, and the head
of a plaster figure. She placed him in his mother's arms.

'There!' said the woman, 'now you go. They'll cry together, and comfort
together, better nor any one but a child can do. I'll stop with her as
long as I'm needed, and if yo' come to-morrow, yo' can have a deal o'
wise talk with her, that she's not up to to-day.'

As Margaret and her father went slowly up the street, she paused at
Higgins's closed door.

'Shall we go in?' asked her father. 'I was thinking of him too.'

They knocked. There was no answer, so they tried the door. It was
bolted, but they thought they heard him moving within.

'Nicholas!' said Margaret. There was no answer, and they might have gone
away, believing the house to be empty, if there had not been some
accidental fall, as of a book, within.

'Nicholas!' said Margaret again. 'It is only us. Won't you let us come
in?'

'No,' said he. 'I spoke as plain as I could, 'bout using words, when I
bolted th' door. Let me be, this day.'

Mr. Hale would have urged their desire, but Margaret placed her finger
on his lips.

'I don't wonder at it,' said she. 'I myself long to be alone. It seems
the only thing to do one good after a day like this.'




CHAPTER XXXVII

LOOKING SOUTH

    'A spade! a rake! a hoe!
     A pickaxe or a bill!
     A hook to reap, or a scythe to mow,
     A flail, or what ye will--
     And here's a ready hand
     To ply the needful tool,
     And skill'd enough, by lessons rough,
     In Labour's rugged school.'
             HOOD.


Higgins's door was locked the next day, when they went to pay their call
on the widow Boucher: but they learnt this time from an officious
neighbour, that he was really from home. He had, however, been in to see
Mrs. Boucher, before starting on his day's business, whatever that was.
It was but an unsatisfactory visit to Mrs. Boucher; she considered
herself as an ill-used woman by her poor husband's suicide; and there
was quite germ of truth enough in this idea to make it a very difficult
one to refute. Still, it was unsatisfactory to see how completely her
thoughts were turned upon herself and her own position, and this
selfishness extended even to her relations with her children, whom she
considered as incumbrances, even in the very midst of her somewhat
animal affection for them. Margaret tried to make acquaintances with one
or two of them, while her father strove to raise the widow's thoughts
into some higher channel than that of mere helpless querulousness. She
found that the children were truer and simpler mourners than the widow.
Daddy had been a kind daddy to them; each could tell, in their eager
stammering way, of some tenderness shown some indulgence granted by the
lost father.

'Is yon thing upstairs really him? it doesna look like him. I'm feared
on it, and I never was feared o' daddy.'

Margaret's heart bled to hear that the mother, in her selfish
requirement of sympathy, had taken her children upstairs to see their
disfigured father. It was intermingling the coarseness of horror with
the profoundness of natural grief. She tried to turn their thoughts in
some other direction; on what they could do for mother; on what--for
this was a more efficacious way of putting it--what father would have
wished them to do. Margaret was more successful than Mr. Hale in her
efforts. The children seeing their little duties lie in action close
around them, began to try each one to do something that she suggested
towards redding up the slatternly room. But her father set too high a
standard, and too abstract a view, before the indolent invalid. She
could not rouse her torpid mind into any vivid imagination of what her
husband's misery might have been before he had resorted to the last
terrible step; she could only look upon it as it affected herself; she
could not enter into the enduring mercy of the God who had not specially
interposed to prevent the water from drowning her prostrate husband; and
although she was secretly blaming her husband for having fallen into
such drear despair, and denying that he had any excuse for his last rash
act, she was inveterate in her abuse of all who could by any possibility
be supposed to have driven him to such desperation. The masters--Mr.
Thornton in particular, whose mill had been attacked by Boucher, and
who, after the warrant had been issued for his apprehension on the
charge of rioting, had caused it to be withdrawn,--the Union, of which
Higgins was the representative to the poor woman,--the children so
numerous, so hungry, and so noisy--all made up one great army of
personal enemies, whose fault it was that she was now a helpless widow.

Margaret heard enough of this unreasonableness to dishearten her; and
when they came away she found it impossible to cheer her father.

'It is the town life,' said she. 'Their nerves are quickened by the
haste and bustle and speed of everything around them, to say nothing of
the confinement in these pent-up houses, which of itself is enough to
induce depression and worry of spirits. Now in the country, people live
so much more out of doors, even children, and even in the winter.'

'But people must live in towns. And in the country some get such
stagnant habits of mind that they are almost fatalists.'

'Yes; I acknowledge that. I suppose each mode of life produces its own
trials and its own temptations. The dweller in towns must find it as
difficult to be patient and calm, as the country-bred man must find it
to be active, and equal to unwonted emergencies. Both must find it hard
to realise a future of any kind; the one because the present is so
living and hurrying and close around him; the other because his life
tempts him to revel in the mere sense of animal existence, not knowing
of, and consequently not caring for any pungency of pleasure for the
attainment of which he can plan, and deny himself and look forward.'

'And thus both the necessity for engrossment, and the stupid content in
the present, produce the same effects. But this poor Mrs. Boucher! how
little we can do for her.'

'And yet we dare not leave her without our efforts, although they may
seem so useless. Oh papa! it's a hard world to live in!'

'So it is, my child. We feel it so just now, at any rate; but we have
been very happy, even in the midst of our sorrow. What a pleasure
Frederick's visit was!'

'Yes, that it was,' said Margaret; brightly. 'It was such a charming,
snatched, forbidden thing.' But she suddenly stopped speaking. She had
spoiled the remembrance of Frederick's visit to herself by her own
cowardice. Of all faults the one she most despised in others was the
want of bravery; the meanness of heart which leads to untruth. And here
had she been guilty of it! Then came the thought of Mr. Thornton's
cognisance of her falsehood. She wondered if she should have minded
detection half so much from any one else. She tried herself in
imagination with her Aunt Shaw and Edith; with her father; with Captain
and Mr. Lennox; with Frederick. The thought of the last knowing what she
had done, even in his own behalf, was the most painful, for the brother
and sister were in the first flush of their mutual regard and love; but
even any fall in Frederick's opinion was as nothing to the shame, the
shrinking shame she felt at the thought of meeting Mr. Thornton again.
And yet she longed to see him, to get it over; to understand where she
stood in his opinion. Her cheeks burnt as she recollected how proudly
she had implied an objection to trade (in the early days of their
acquaintance), because it too often led to the deceit of passing off
inferior for superior goods, in the one branch; of assuming credit for
wealth and resources not possessed, in the other. She remembered Mr.
Thornton's look of calm disdain, as in few words he gave her to
understand that, in the great scheme of commerce, all dishonourable ways
of acting were sure to prove injurious in the long run, and that,
testing such actions simply according to the poor standard of success,
there was folly and not wisdom in all such, and every kind of deceit in
trade, as well as in other things. She remembered--she, then strong in
her own untempted truth--asking him, if he did not think that buying in
the cheapest and selling in the dearest market proved some want of the
transparent justice which is so intimately connected with the idea of
truth: and she had used the word chivalric--and her father had corrected
her with the higher word, Christian; and so drawn the argument upon
himself, while she sate silent by with a slight feeling of contempt.

No more contempt for her!--no more talk about the chivalric!
Henceforward she must feel humiliated and disgraced in his sight. But
when should she see him? Her heart leaped up in apprehension at every
ring of the door-bell; and yet when it fell down to calmness, she felt
strangely saddened and sick at heart at each disappointment. It was very
evident that her father expected to see him, and was surprised that he
did not come. The truth was, that there were points in their
conversation the other night on which they had no time then to enlarge;
but it had been understood that if possible on the succeeding
evening--if not then, at least the very first evening that Mr. Thornton
could command,--they should meet for further discussion. Mr. Hale had
looked forward to this meeting ever since they had parted. He had not
yet resumed the instruction to his pupils, which he had relinquished at
the commencement of his wife's more serious illness, so he had fewer
occupations than usual; and the great interest of the last day or so
(Boucher's suicide) had driven him back with more eagerness than ever
upon his speculations. He was restless all evening. He kept saying, 'I
quite expected to have seen Mr. Thornton. I think the messenger who
brought the book last night must have had some note, and forgot to
deliver it. Do you think there has been any message left to-day?'

'I will go and inquire, papa,' said Margaret, after the changes on these
sentences had been rung once or twice. 'Stay, there's a ring!' She sate
down instantly, and bent her head attentively over her work. She heard a
step on the stairs, but it was only one, and she knew it was Dixon's.
She lifted up her head and sighed, and believed she felt glad.

'It's that Higgins, sir. He wants to see you, or else Miss Hale. Or it
might be Miss Hale first, and then you, sir; for he's in a strange kind
of way.

'He had better come up here, Dixon; and then he can see us both, and
choose which he likes for his listener.'

'Oh! very well, sir. I've no wish to hear what he's got to say, I'm
sure; only, if you could see his shoes, I'm sure you'd say the kitchen
was the fitter place.

'He can wipe them, I suppose, said Mr. Hale. So Dixon flung off, to bid
him walk up-stairs. She was a little mollified, however, when he looked
at his feet with a hesitating air; and then, sitting down on the bottom
stair, he took off the offending shoes, and without a word walked
up-stairs.

'Sarvant, sir!' said he, slicking his hair down when he came into the
room. 'If hoo'l excuse me (looking at Margaret) for being i' my
stockings; I'se been tramping a' day, and streets is none o' th'
cleanest.'

Margaret thought that fatigue might account for the change in his
manner, for he was unusually quiet and subdued; and he had evidently
some difficulty in saying what he came to say.

Mr. Hale's ever-ready sympathy with anything of shyness or hesitation,
or want of self-possession, made him come to his aid.

'We shall have tea up directly, and then you'll take a cup with us, Mr.
Higgins. I am sure you are tired, if you've been out much this wet
relaxing day. Margaret, my dear, can't you hasten tea?'

Margaret could only hasten tea by taking the preparation of it into her
own hands, and so offending Dixon, who was emerging out of her sorrow
for her late mistress into a very touchy, irritable state. But Martha,
like all who came in contact with Margaret--even Dixon herself, in the
long run--felt it a pleasure and an honour to forward any of her wishes;
and her readiness, and Margaret's sweet forbearance, soon made Dixon
ashamed of herself.

'Why master and you must always be asking the lower classes up-stairs,
since we came to Milton, I cannot understand. Folk at Helstone were
never brought higher than the kitchen; and I've let one or two of them
know before now that they might think it an honour to be even there.'

Higgins found it easier to unburden himself to one than to two. After
Margaret left the room, he went to the door and assured himself that it
was shut. Then he came and stood close to Mr. Hale.

'Master,' said he, 'yo'd not guess easy what I've been tramping after
to-day. Special if yo' remember my manner o' talk yesterday. I've been a
seeking work. I have' said he. 'I said to mysel', I'd keep a civil
tongue in my head, let who would say what 'em would. I'd set my teeth
into my tongue sooner nor speak i' haste. For that man's sake--yo'
understand,' jerking his thumb back in some unknown direction.

'No, I don't,' said Mr. Hale, seeing he waited for some kind of assent,
and completely bewildered as to who 'that man' could be.

'That chap as lies theer,' said he, with another jerk. 'Him as went and
drownded himself, poor chap! I did na' think he'd got it in him to lie
still and let th' water creep o'er him till he died. Boucher, yo' know.'

'Yes, I know now,' said Mr. Hale. 'Go back to what you were saying:
you'd not speak in haste---- '

'For his sake. Yet not for his sake; for where'er he is, and whate'er,
he'll ne'er know other clemming or cold again; but for the wife's sake,
and the bits o' childer.'

'God bless you!' said Mr. Hale, starting up; then, calming down, he said
breathlessly, 'What do you mean? Tell me out.'

'I have telled yo',' said Higgins, a little surprised at Mr. Hale's
agitation. 'I would na ask for work for mysel'; but them's left as a
charge on me. I reckon, I would ha guided Boucher to a better end; but I
set him off o' th' road, and so I mun answer for him.'

Mr. Hale got hold of Higgins's hand and shook it heartily, without
speaking. Higgins looked awkward and ashamed.

'Theer, theer, master! Theer's ne'er a man, to call a man, amongst us,
but what would do th' same; ay, and better too; for, belie' me, I'se
ne'er got a stroke o' work, nor yet a sight of any. For all I telled
Hamper that, let alone his pledge--which I would not sign--no, I could
na, not e'en for this--he'd ne'er ha' such a worker on his mill as I
would be--he'd ha' none o' me--no more would none o' th' others. I'm a
poor black feckless sheep--childer may clem for aught I can do, unless,
parson, yo'd help me?'

'Help you! How? I would do anything,--but what can I do?'

'Miss there'--for Margaret had re-entered the room, and stood silent,
listening--'has often talked grand o' the South, and the ways down
there. Now I dunnot know how far off it is, but I've been thinking if I
could get 'em down theer, where food is cheap and wages good, and all
the folk, rich and poor, master and man, friendly like; yo' could, may
be, help me to work. I'm not forty-five, and I've a deal o' strength in
me, measter.'

'But what kind of work could you do, my man?'

'Well, I reckon I could spade a bit---- '

'And for that,' said Margaret, stepping forwards, 'for anything you
could do, Higgins, with the best will in the world, you would, may be,
get nine shillings a week; maybe ten, at the outside. Food is much the
same as here, except that you might have a little garden---- '

'The childer could work at that,' said he. 'I'm sick o' Milton anyways,
and Milton is sick o' me.'

'You must not go to the South,' said Margaret, 'for all that. You could
not stand it. You would have to be out all weathers. It would kill you
with rheumatism. The mere bodily work at your time of life would break
you down. The fare is far different to what you have been accustomed
to.'

'I'se nought particular about my meat,' said he, as if offended.

'But you've reckoned on having butcher's meat once a day, if you're in
work; pay for that out of your ten shillings, and keep those poor
children if you can. I owe it to you--since it's my way of talking that
has set you off on this idea--to put it all clear before you. You would
not bear the dulness of the life; you don't know what it is; it would
eat you away like rust. Those that have lived there all their lives, are
used to soaking in the stagnant waters. They labour on, from day to day,
in the great solitude of steaming fields--never speaking or lifting up
their poor, bent, downcast heads. The hard spade-work robs their brain
of life; the sameness of their toil deadens their imagination; they
don't care to meet to talk over thoughts and speculations, even of the
weakest, wildest kind, after their work is done; they go home brutishly
tired, poor creatures! caring for nothing but food and rest. You could
not stir them up into any companionship, which you get in a town as
plentiful as the air you breathe, whether it be good or bad--and that I
don't know; but I do know, that you of all men are not one to bear a
life among such labourers. What would be peace to them would be eternal
fretting to you. Think no more of it, Nicholas, I beg. Besides, you
could never pay to get mother and children all there--that's one good
thing.'

'I've reckoned for that. One house mun do for us a', and the furniture
o' t'other would go a good way. And men theer mun have their families to
keep--mappen six or seven childer. God help 'em!' said he, more
convinced by his own presentation of the facts than by all Margaret had
said, and suddenly renouncing the idea, which had but recently formed
itself in a brain worn out by the day's fatigue and anxiety. 'God help
'em! North an' South have each getten their own troubles. If work's sure
and steady theer, labour's paid at starvation prices; while here we'n
rucks o' money coming in one quarter, and ne'er a farthing th' next. For
sure, th' world is in a confusion that passes me or any other man to
understand; it needs fettling, and who's to fettle it, if it's as yon
folks say, and there's nought but what we see?'

Mr. Hale was busy cutting bread and butter; Margaret was glad of this,
for she saw that Higgins was better left to himself: that if her father
began to speak ever so mildly on the subject of Higgins's thoughts, the
latter would consider himself challenged to an argument, and would feel
himself bound to maintain his own ground. She and her father kept up an
indifferent conversation until Higgins, scarcely aware whether he ate or
not, had made a very substantial meal. Then he pushed his chair away
from the table, and tried to take an interest in what they were saying;
but it was of no use; and he fell back into dreamy gloom. Suddenly,
Margaret said (she had been thinking of it for some time, but the words
had stuck in her throat), 'Higgins, have you been to Marlborough Mills
to seek for work?'

'Thornton's?' asked he. 'Ay, I've been at Thornton's.'

'And what did he say?'

'Such a chap as me is not like to see the measter. Th' o'erlooker bid me
go and be d---- d.'

'I wish you had seen Mr. Thornton,' said Mr. Hale. 'He might not have
given you work, but he would not have used such language.'

'As to th' language, I'm welly used to it; it dunnot matter to me. I'm
not nesh mysel' when I'm put out. It were th' fact that I were na wanted
theer, no more nor ony other place, as I minded.'

'But I wish you had seen Mr. Thornton,' repeated Margaret. 'Would you go
again--it's a good deal to ask, I know--but would you go to-morrow and
try him? I should be so glad if you would.'

'I'm afraid it would be of no use,' said Mr. Hale, in a low voice. 'It
would be better to let me speak to him.' Margaret still looked at
Higgins for his answer. Those grave soft eyes of hers were difficult to
resist. He gave a great sigh.

'It would tax my pride above a bit; if it were for mysel', I could stand
a deal o' clemming first; I'd sooner knock him down than ask a favour
from him. I'd a deal sooner be flogged mysel'; but yo're not a common
wench, axing yo'r pardon, nor yet have yo' common ways about yo'. I'll
e'en make a wry face, and go at it to-morrow. Dunna yo' think that he'll
do it. That man has it in him to be burnt at the stake afore he'll give
in. I do it for yo'r sake, Miss Hale, and it's first time in my life as
e'er I give way to a woman. Neither my wife nor Bess could e'er say that
much again me.'

'All the more do I thank you,' said Margaret, smiling. 'Though I don't
believe you: I believe you have just given way to wife and daughter as
much as most men.'

'And as to Mr. Thornton,' said Mr. Hale, 'I'll give you a note to him,
which, I think I may venture to say, will ensure you a hearing.'

'I thank yo' kindly, sir, but I'd as lief stand on my own bottom. I
dunnot stomach the notion of having favour curried for me, by one as
doesn't know the ins and outs of the quarrel. Meddling 'twixt master and
man is liker meddling 'twixt husband and wife than aught else: it takes
a deal o' wisdom for to do ony good. I'll stand guard at the lodge door.
I'll stand there fro' six in the morning till I get speech on him. But
I'd liefer sweep th' streets, if paupers had na' got hold on that work.
Dunna yo' hope, miss. There'll be more chance o' getting milk out of a
flint. I wish yo' a very good night, and many thanks to yo'.'

'You'll find your shoes by the kitchen fire; I took them there to dry,'
said Margaret.

He turned round and looked at her steadily, and then he brushed his lean
hand across his eyes and went his way.

'How proud that man is!' said her father, who was a little annoyed at
the manner in which Higgins had declined his intercession with Mr.
Thornton.

'He is,' said Margaret; 'but what grand makings of a man there are in
him, pride and all.'

'It's amusing to see how he evidently respects the part in Mr.
Thornton's character which is like his own.'

'There's granite in all these northern people, papa, is there not?'

'There was none in poor Boucher, I am afraid; none in his wife either.'

'I should guess from their tones that they had Irish blood in them. I
wonder what success he'll have to-morrow. If he and Mr. Thornton would
speak out together as man to man--if Higgins would forget that Mr.
Thornton was a master, and speak to him as he does to us--and if Mr.
Thornton would be patient enough to listen to him with his human heart,
not with his master's ears--'

'You are getting to do Mr. Thornton justice at last, Margaret,' said her
father, pinching her ear.

Margaret had a strange choking at her heart, which made her unable to
answer. 'Oh!' thought she, 'I wish I were a man, that I could go and
force him to express his disapprobation, and tell him honestly that I
knew I deserved it. It seems hard to lose him as a friend just when I
had begun to feel his value. How tender he was with dear mamma! If it
were only for her sake, I wish he would come, and then at least I should
know how much I was abased in his eyes.'




CHAPTER XXXVIII

PROMISES FULFILLED

    'Then proudly, proudly up she rose,
     Tho' the tear was in her e'e,
     "Whate'er ye say, think what ye may,
     Ye's get na word frae me!"'
             SCOTCH BALLAD.


It was not merely that Margaret was known to Mr. Thornton to have spoken
falsely,--though she imagined that for this reason only was she so
turned in his opinion,--but that this falsehood of hers bore a distinct
reference in his mind to some other lover. He could not forget the fond
and earnest look that had passed between her and some other man--the
attitude of familiar confidence, if not of positive endearment. The
thought of this perpetually stung him; it was a picture before his eyes,
wherever he went and whatever he was doing. In addition to this (and he
ground his teeth as he remembered it), was the hour, dusky twilight; the
place, so far away from home, and comparatively unfrequented. His nobler
self had said at first, that all this last might be accidental,
innocent, justifiable; but once allow her right to love and be beloved
(and had he any reason to deny her right?--had not her words been
severely explicit when she cast his love away from her?), she might
easily have been beguiled into a longer walk, on to a later hour than
she had anticipated. But that falsehood! which showed a fatal
consciousness of something wrong, and to be concealed, which was unlike
her. He did her that justice, though all the time it would have been a
relief to believe her utterly unworthy of his esteem. It was this that
made the misery--that he passionately loved her, and thought her, even
with all her faults, more lovely and more excellent than any other
woman; yet he deemed her so attached to some other man, so led away by
her affection for him as to violate her truthful nature. The very
falsehood that stained her, was a proof how blindly she loved
another--this dark, slight, elegant, handsome man--while he himself was
rough, and stern, and strongly made. He lashed himself into an agony of
fierce jealousy. He thought of that look, that attitude!--how he would
have laid his life at her feet for such tender glances, such fond
detention! He mocked at himself, for having valued the mechanical way in
which she had protected him from the fury of the mob; now he had seen
how soft and bewitching she looked when with a man she really loved. He
remembered, point by point, the sharpness of her words--'There was not a
man in all that crowd for whom she would not have done as much, far more
readily than for him.' He shared with the mob, in her desire of averting
bloodshed from them; but this man, this hidden lover, shared with
nobody; he had looks, words, hand-cleavings, lies, concealment, all to
himself.

Mr. Thornton was conscious that he had never been so irritable as he was
now, in all his life long; he felt inclined to give a short abrupt
answer, more like a bark than a speech, to every one that asked him a
question; and this consciousness hurt his pride: he had always piqued
himself on his self-control, and control himself he would. So the manner
was subdued to a quiet deliberation, but the matter was even harder and
sterner than common. He was more than usually silent at home; employing
his evenings in a continual pace backwards and forwards, which would
have annoyed his mother exceedingly if it had been practised by any one
else; and did not tend to promote any forbearance on her part even to
this beloved son.

'Can you stop--can you sit down for a moment? I have something to say to
you, if you would give up that everlasting walk, walk, walk.'

He sat down instantly, on a chair against the wall.

'I want to speak to you about Betsy. She says she must leave us; that
her lover's death has so affected her spirits she can't give her heart
to her work.'

'Very well. I suppose other cooks are to be met with.'

'That's so like a man. It's not merely the cooking, it is that she knows
all the ways of the house. Besides, she tells me something about your
friend Miss Hale.'

'Miss Hale is no friend of mine. Mr. Hale is my friend.'

'I am glad to hear you say so, for if she had been your friend, what
Betsy says would have annoyed you.'

'Let me hear it,' said he, with the extreme quietness of manner he had
been assuming for the last few days.

'Betsy says, that the night on which her lover--I forget his name--for
she always calls him "he"---- '

'Leonards.'

'The night on which Leonards was last seen at the station--when he was
last seen on duty, in fact--Miss Hale was there, walking about with a
young man who, Betsy believes, killed Leonards by some blow or push.'

'Leonards was not killed by any blow or push.'

'How do you know?'

'Because I distinctly put the question to the surgeon of the Infirmary.
He told me there was an internal disease of long standing, caused by
Leonards' habit of drinking to excess; that the fact of his becoming
rapidly worse while in a state of intoxication, settled the question as
to whether the last fatal attack was caused by excess of drinking, or
the fall.'

'The fall! What fall?'

'Caused by the blow or push of which Betsy speaks.'

'Then there was a blow or push?'

'I believe so.'

'And who did it?'

'As there was no inquest, in consequence of the doctor's opinion, I
cannot tell you.'

'But Miss Hale was there?'

No answer.

'And with a young man?'

Still no answer. At last he said: 'I tell you, mother, that there was no
inquest--no inquiry. No judicial inquiry, I mean.'

'Betsy says that Woolmer (some man she knows, who is in a grocer's shop
out at Crampton) can swear that Miss Hale was at the station at that
hour, walking backwards and forwards with a young man.'

'I don't see what we have to do with that. Miss Hale is at liberty to
please herself.'

'I'm glad to hear you say so,' said Mrs. Thornton, eagerly. 'It
certainly signifies very little to us--not at all to you, after what has
passed! but I--I made a promise to Mrs. Hale, that I would not allow her
daughter to go wrong without advising and remonstrating with her. I
shall certainly let her know my opinion of such conduct.'

'I do not see any harm in what she did that evening,' said Mr. Thornton,
getting up, and coming near to his mother; he stood by the chimney-piece
with his face turned away from the room.

'You would not have approved of Fanny's being seen out, after dark, in
rather a lonely place, walking about with a young man. I say nothing of
the taste which could choose the time, when her mother lay unburied, for
such a promenade. Should you have liked your sister to have been noticed
by a grocer's assistant for doing so?'

'In the first place, as it is not many years since I myself was a
draper's assistant, the mere circumstance of a grocer's assistant
noticing any act does not alter the character of the act to me. And in
the next place, I see a great deal of difference between Miss Hale and
Fanny. I can imagine that the one may have weighty reasons, which may
and ought to make her overlook any seeming Impropriety in her conduct. I
never knew Fanny have weighty reasons for anything. Other people must
guard her. I believe Miss Hale is a guardian to herself.'

'A pretty character of your sister, indeed! Really, John, one would have
thought Miss Hale had done enough to make you clear-sighted. She drew
you on to an offer, by a bold display of pretended regard for you,--to
play you off against this very young man, I've no doubt. Her whole
conduct is clear to me now. You believe he is her lover, I suppose--you
agree to that.'

He turned round to his mother; his face was very gray and grim. 'Yes,
mother. I do believe he is her lover.' When he had spoken, he turned
round again; he writhed himself about, like one in bodily pain. He leant
his face against his hand. Then before she could speak, he turned sharp
again:

'Mother. He is her lover, whoever he is; but she may need help and
womanly counsel;--there may be difficulties or temptations which I don't
know. I fear there are. I don't want to know what they are; but as you
have ever been a good--ay! and a tender mother to me, go to her, and
gain her confidence, and tell her what is best to be done. I know that
something is wrong; some dread, must be a terrible torture to her.'

'For God's sake, John!' said his mother, now really shocked, 'what do
you mean? What do you mean? What do you know?'

He did not reply to her.

'John! I don't know what I shan't think unless you speak. You have no
right to say what you have done against her.'

'Not against her, mother! I _could_ not speak against her.'

'Well! you have no right to say what you have done, unless you say more.
These half-expressions are what ruin a woman's character.'

'Her character! Mother, you do not dare--' he faced about, and looked
into her face with his flaming eyes. Then, drawing himself up into
determined composure and dignity, he said, 'I will not say any more than
this, which is neither more nor less than the simple truth, and I am
sure you believe me,--I have good reason to believe, that Miss Hale is
in some strait and difficulty connected with an attachment which, of
itself, from my knowledge of Miss Hale's character, is perfectly
innocent and right. What my reason is, I refuse to tell. But never let
me hear any one say a word against her, implying any more serious
imputation than that she now needs the counsel of some kind and gentle
woman. You promised Mrs. Hale to be that woman!'

'No!' said Mrs. Thornton. 'I am happy to say, I did not promise kindness
and gentleness, for I felt at the time that it might be out of my power
to render these to one of Miss Hale's character and disposition. I
promised counsel and advice, such as I would give to my own daughter; I
shall speak to her as I would do to Fanny, if she had gone gallivanting
with a young man in the dusk. I shall speak with relation to the
circumstances I know, without being influenced either one way or another
by the "strong reasons" which you will not confide to me. Then I shall
have fulfilled my promise, and done my duty.'

'She will never bear it,' said he passionately.

'She will have to bear it, if I speak in her dead mother's name.'

'Well!' said he, breaking away, 'don't tell me any more about it. I
cannot endure to think of it. It will be better that you should speak to
her any way, than that she should not be spoken to at all.--Oh! that
look of love!' continued he, between his teeth, as he bolted himself
into his own private room. 'And that cursed lie; which showed some
terrible shame in the background, to be kept from the light in which I
thought she lived perpetually! Oh, Margaret, Margaret! Mother, how you
have tortured me! Oh! Margaret, could you not have loved me? I am but
uncouth and hard, but I would never have led you into any falsehood for
me.'

The more Mrs. Thornton thought over what her son had said, in pleading
for a merciful judgment for Margaret's indiscretion, the more bitterly
she felt inclined towards her. She took a savage pleasure in the idea of
'speaking her mind' to her, in the guise of fulfilment of a duty. She
enjoyed the thought of showing herself untouched by the 'glamour,' which
she was well aware Margaret had the power of throwing over many people.
She snorted scornfully over the picture of the beauty of her victim; her
jet black hair, her clear smooth skin, her lucid eyes would not help to
save her one word of the just and stern reproach which Mrs. Thornton
spent half the night in preparing to her mind.

'Is Miss Hale within?' She knew she was, for she had seen her at the
window, and she had her feet inside the little hall before Martha had
half answered her question.

Margaret was sitting alone, writing to Edith, and giving her many
particulars of her mother's last days. It was a softening employment,
and she had to brush away the unbidden tears as Mrs. Thornton was
announced.

She was so gentle and ladylike in her mode of reception that her visitor
was somewhat daunted; and it became impossible to utter the speech, so
easy of arrangement with no one to address it to. Margaret's low rich
voice was softer than usual; her manner more gracious, because in her
heart she was feeling very grateful to Mrs. Thornton for the courteous
attention of her call. She exerted herself to find subjects of interest
for conversation; praised Martha, the servant whom Mrs. Thornton had
found for them; had asked Edith for a little Greek air, about which she
had spoken to Miss Thornton. Mrs. Thornton was fairly discomfited. Her
sharp Damascus blade seemed out of place, and useless among rose-leaves.
She was silent, because she was trying to task herself up to her duty.
At last, she stung herself into its performance by a suspicion which, in
spite of all probability, she allowed to cross her mind, that all this
sweetness was put on with a view of propitiating Mr. Thornton; that,
somehow, the other attachment had fallen through, and that it suited
Miss Hale's purpose to recall her rejected lover. Poor Margaret! there
was perhaps so much truth in the suspicion as this: that Mrs. Thornton
was the mother of one whose regard she valued, and feared to have lost;
and this thought unconsciously added to her natural desire of pleasing
one who was showing her kindness by her visit. Mrs. Thornton stood up to
go, but yet she seemed to have something more to say. She cleared her
throat and began:

'Miss Hale, I have a duty to perform. I promised your poor mother that,
as far as my poor judgment went, I would not allow you to act in any way
wrongly, or (she softened her speech down a little here) inadvertently,
without remonstrating; at least, without offering advice, whether you
took it or not.'

Margaret stood before her, blushing like any culprit, with her eyes
dilating as she gazed at Mrs. Thornton. She thought she had come to
speak to her about the falsehood she had told--that Mr. Thornton had
employed her to explain the danger she had exposed herself to, of being
confuted in full court! and although her heart sank to think he had not
rather chosen to come himself, and upbraid her, and receive her
penitence, and restore her again to his good opinion, yet she was too
much humbled not to bear any blame on this subject patiently and meekly.

Mrs. Thornton went on:

'At first, when I heard from one of my servants, that you had been seen
walking about with a gentleman, so far from home as the Outwood station,
at such a time of the evening, I could hardly believe it. But my son, I
am sorry to say, confirmed her story. It was indiscreet, to say the
least; many a young woman has lost her character before now---- '

Margaret's eyes flashed fire. This was a new idea--this was too
insulting. If Mrs. Thornton had spoken to her about the lie she had
told, well and good--she would have owned it, and humiliated herself.
But to interfere with her conduct--to speak of her character! she--Mrs.
Thornton, a mere stranger--it was too impertinent! She would not answer
her--not one word. Mrs. Thornton saw the battle-spirit in Margaret's
eyes, and it called up her combativeness also.

'For your mother's sake, I have thought it right to warn you against
such improprieties; they must degrade you in the long run in the
estimation of the world, even if in fact they do not lead you to
positive harm.'

'For my mother's sake,' said Margaret, in a tearful voice, 'I will bear
much; but I cannot bear everything. She never meant me to be exposed to
insult, I am sure.'

'Insult, Miss Hale!'

'Yes, madam,' said Margaret more steadily, 'it is insult. What do you
know of me that should lead you to suspect--Oh!' said she, breaking
down, and covering her face with her hands--'I know now, Mr. Thornton
has told you---- '

'No, Miss Hale,' said Mrs. Thornton, her truthfulness causing her to
arrest the confession Margaret was on the point of making, though her
curiosity was itching to hear it. 'Stop. Mr. Thornton has told me
nothing. You do not know my son. You are not worthy to know him. He said
this. Listen, young lady, that you may understand, if you can, what sort
of a man you rejected. This Milton manufacturer, his great tender heart
scorned as it was scorned, said to me only last night, "Go to her. I
have good reason to know that she is in some strait, arising out of some
attachment; and she needs womanly counsel." I believe those were his
very words. Farther than that--beyond admitting the fact of your being
at the Outwood station with a gentleman, on the evening of the
twenty-sixth--he has said nothing--not one word against you. If he has
knowledge of anything which should make you sob so, he keeps it to
himself.'

Margaret's face was still hidden in her hands, the fingers of which were
wet with tears. Mrs. Thornton was a little mollified.

'Come, Miss Hale. There may be circumstances, I'll allow, that, if
explained, may take off from the seeming impropriety.'

Still no answer. Margaret was considering what to say; she wished to
stand well with Mrs. Thornton; and yet she could not, might not, give
any explanation. Mrs. Thornton grew impatient.

'I shall be sorry to break off an acquaintance; but for Fanny's sake--as
I told my son, if Fanny had done so we should consider it a great
disgrace--and Fanny might be led away---- '

'I can give you no explanation,' said Margaret, in a low voice. 'I have
done wrong, but not in the way you think or know about. I think Mr.
Thornton judges me more mercifully than you;'--she had hard work to keep
herself from choking with her tears--'but, I believe, madam, you mean to
do rightly.'

'Thank you,' said Mrs. Thornton, drawing herself up; 'I was not aware
that my meaning was doubted. It is the last time I shall interfere. I
was unwilling to consent to do it, when your mother asked me. I had not
approved of my son's attachment to you, while I only suspected it. You
did not appear to me worthy of him. But when you compromised yourself as
you did at the time of the riot, and exposed yourself to the comments of
servants and workpeople, I felt it was no longer right to set myself
against my son's wish of proposing to you--a wish, by the way, which he
had always denied entertaining until the day of the riot.' Margaret
winced, and drew in her breath with a long, hissing sound; of which,
however, Mrs. Thornton took no notice. 'He came; you had apparently
changed your mind. I told my son yesterday, that I thought it possible,
short as was the interval, you might have heard or learnt something of
this other lover---- '

'What must you think of me, madam?' asked Margaret, throwing her head
back with proud disdain, till her throat curved outwards like a swan's.
'You can say nothing more, Mrs. Thornton. I decline every attempt to
justify myself for anything. You must allow me to leave the room.'

And she swept out of it with the noiseless grace of an offended
princess. Mrs. Thornton had quite enough of natural humour to make her
feel the ludicrousness of the position in which she was left. There was
nothing for it but to show herself out. She was not particularly annoyed
at Margaret's way of behaving. She did not care enough for her for that.
She had taken Mrs. Thornton's remonstrance to the full as keenly to
heart as that lady expected; and Margaret's passion at once mollified
her visitor, far more than any silence or reserve could have done. It
showed the effect of her words. 'My young lady,' thought Mrs. Thornton
to herself; 'you've a pretty good temper of your own. If John and you
had come together, he would have had to keep a tight hand over you, to
make you know your place. But I don't think you will go a-walking again
with your beau, at such an hour of the day, in a hurry. You've too much
pride and spirit in you for that. I like to see a girl fly out at the
notion of being talked about. It shows they're neither giddy, nor bold
by nature. As for that girl, she might be bold, but she'd never be
giddy. I'll do her that justice. Now as to Fanny, she'd be giddy, and
not bold. She's no courage in her, poor thing!'

Mr. Thornton was not spending the morning so satisfactorily as his
mother. She, at any rate, was fulfilling her determined purpose. He was
trying to understand where he stood; what damage the strike had done
him. A good deal of his capital was locked up in new and expensive
machinery; and he had also bought cotton largely, with a view to some
great orders which he had in hand. The strike had thrown him terribly
behindhand, as to the completion of these orders. Even with his own
accustomed and skilled workpeople, he would have had some difficulty in
fulfilling his engagements; as it was, the incompetence of the Irish
hands, who had to be trained to their work, at a time requiring unusual
activity, was a daily annoyance.

It was not a favourable hour for Higgins to make his request. But he had
promised Margaret to do it at any cost. So, though every moment added to
his repugnance, his pride, and his sullenness of temper, he stood
leaning against the dead wall, hour after hour, first on one leg, then
on the other. At last the latch was sharply lifted, and out came Mr.
Thornton.

'I want for to speak to yo', sir.'

'Can't stay now, my man. I'm too late as it is.'

'Well, sir, I reckon I can wait till yo' come back.'

Mr. Thornton was half way down the street. Higgins sighed. But it was no
use. To catch him in the street was his only chance of seeing 'the
measter;' if he had rung the lodge bell, or even gone up to the house to
ask for him, he would have been referred to the overlooker. So he stood
still again, vouchsafing no answer, but a short nod of recognition to
the few men who knew and spoke to him, as the crowd drove out of the
millyard at dinner-time, and scowling with all his might at the Irish
'knobsticks' who had just been imported. At last Mr. Thornton returned.

'What! you there still!'

'Ay, sir. I mun speak to yo'.'

'Come in here, then. Stay, we'll go across the yard; the men are not
come back, and we shall have it to ourselves. These good people, I see,
are at dinner;' said he, closing the door of the porter's lodge.

He stopped to speak to the overlooker. The latter said in a low tone:

'I suppose you know, sir, that that man is Higgins, one of the leaders
of the Union; he that made that speech in Hurstfield.'

'No, I didn't,' said Mr. Thornton, looking round sharply at his
follower. Higgins was known to him by name as a turbulent spirit.

'Come along,' said he, and his tone was rougher than before. 'It is men
such as this,' thought he, 'who interrupt commerce and injure the very
town they live in: mere demagogues, lovers of power, at whatever cost to
others.'

'Well, sir! what do you want with me?' said Mr. Thornton, facing round
at him, as soon as they were in the counting-house of the mill.

'My name is Higgins'--

'I know that,' broke in Mr. Thornton. 'What do you want, Mr. Higgins?
That's the question.'

'I want work.'

'Work! You're a pretty chap to come asking me for work. You don't want
impudence, that's very clear.'

'I've getten enemies and backbiters, like my betters; but I ne'er heerd
o' ony of them calling me o'er-modest,' said Higgins. His blood was a
little roused by Mr. Thornton's manner, more than by his words.

Mr. Thornton saw a letter addressed to himself on the table. He took it
up and read it through. At the end, he looked up and said, 'What are you
waiting for?'

'An answer to the question I axed.'

'I gave it you before. Don't waste any more of your time.'

'Yo' made a remark, sir, on my impudence: but I were taught that it was
manners to say either "yes" or "no," when I were axed a civil question.
I should be thankfu' to yo' if yo'd give me work. Hamper will speak to
my being a good hand.'

'I've a notion you'd better not send me to Hamper to ask for a
character, my man. I might hear more than you'd like.'

'I'd take th' risk. Worst they could say of me is, that I did what I
thought best, even to my own wrong.'

'You'd better go and try them, then, and see whether they'll give you
work. I've turned off upwards of a hundred of my best hands, for no
other fault than following you and such as you; and d'ye think I'll take
you on? I might as well put a firebrand into the midst of the
cotton-waste.'

Higgins turned away; then the recollection of Boucher came over him, and
he faced round with the greatest concession he could persuade himself to
make.

'I'd promise yo', measter, I'd not speak a word as could do harm, if so
be yo' did right by us; and I'd promise more: I'd promise that when I
seed yo' going wrong, and acting unfair, I'd speak to yo' in private
first; and that would be a fair warning. If yo' and I did na agree in
our opinion o' your conduct, yo' might turn me off at an hour's notice.'

'Upon my word, you don't think small beer of yourself! Hamper has had a
loss of you. How came he to let you and your wisdom go?'

'Well, we parted wi' mutual dissatisfaction. I wouldn't gi'e the pledge
they were asking; and they wouldn't have me at no rate. So I'm free to
make another engagement; and as I said before, though I should na' say
it, I'm a good hand, measter, and a steady man--specially when I can
keep fro' drink; and that I shall do now, if I ne'er did afore.'

'That you may have more money laid up for another strike, I suppose?'

'No! I'd be thankful if I was free to do that; it's for to keep th'
widow and childer of a man who was drove mad by them knobsticks o'
yourn; put out of his place by a Paddy that did na know weft fro' warp.'

'Well! you'd better turn to something else, if you've any such good
intention in your head. I shouldn't advise you to stay in Milton: you're
too well known here.'

'If it were summer,' said Higgins, 'I'd take to Paddy's work, and go as
a navvy, or haymaking, or summut, and ne'er see Milton again. But it's
winter, and th' childer will clem.'

'A pretty navvy you'd make! why, you couldn't do half a day's work at
digging against an Irishman.'

'I'd only charge half-a-day for th' twelve hours, if I could only do
half-a-day's work in th' time. Yo're not knowing of any place, where
they could gi' me a trial, away fro' the mills, if I'm such a firebrand?
I'd take any wage they thought I was worth, for the sake of those
childer.'

'Don't you see what you would be? You'd be a knobstick. You'd be taking
less wages than the other labourers--all for the sake of another man's
children. Think how you'd abuse any poor fellow who was willing to take
what he could get to keep his own children. You and your Union would
soon be down upon him. No! no! if it's only for the recollection of the
way in which you've used the poor knobsticks before now, I say No! to
your question. I'll not give you work. I won't say, I don't believe your
pretext for coming and asking for work; I know nothing about it. It may
be true, or it may not. It's a very unlikely story, at any rate. Let me
pass. I'll not give you work. There's your answer.'

'I hear, sir. I would na ha' troubled yo', but that I were bid to come,
by one as seemed to think yo'd getten some soft place in yo'r heart.
Hoo were mistook, and I were misled. But I'm not the first man as is
misled by a woman.'

'Tell her to mind her own business the next time, instead of taking up
your time and mine too. I believe women are at the bottom of every
plague in this world. Be off with you.'

'I'm obleeged to yo' for a' yo'r kindness, measter, and most of a' for
yo'r civil way o' saying good-bye.'

Mr. Thornton did not deign a reply. But, looking out of the window a
minute after, he was struck with the lean, bent figure going out of the
yard: the heavy walk was in strange contrast with the resolute, clear
determination of the man to speak to him. He crossed to the porter's
lodge:

'How long has that man Higgins been waiting to speak to me?'

'He was outside the gate before eight o'clock, sir. I think he's been
there ever since.'

'And it is now--?'

'Just one, sir.'

'Five hours,' thought Mr. Thornton; 'it's a long time for a man to wait,
doing nothing but first hoping and then fearing.'




CHAPTER XXXIX

MAKING FRIENDS

    'Nay, I have done; you get no more of me:
     And I am glad, yea glad with all my heart,
     That thus so clearly I myself am free.'
             DRAYTON.


Margaret shut herself up in her own room, after she had quitted Mrs.
Thornton. She began to walk backwards and forwards, in her old habitual
way of showing agitation; but, then, remembering that in that
slightly-built house every step was heard from one room to another, she
sate down until she heard Mrs. Thornton go safely out of the house. She
forced herself to recollect all the conversation that had passed between
them; speech by speech, she compelled her memory to go through with it.
At the end, she rose up, and said to herself, in a melancholy tone:

'At any rate, her words do not touch me; they fall off from me; for I am
innocent of all the motives she attributes to me. But still, it is hard
to think that any one--any woman--can believe all this of another so
easily. It is hard and sad. Where I have done wrong, she does not accuse
me--she does not know. He never told her: I might have known he would
not!'

She lifted up her head, as if she took pride in any delicacy of feeling
which Mr. Thornton had shown. Then, as a new thought came across her,
she pressed her hands tightly together.

'He, too, must take poor Frederick for some lover.' (She blushed as the
word passed through her mind.) 'I see it now. It is not merely that he
knows of my falsehood, but he believes that some one else cares for me;
and that I---- Oh dear!--oh dear! What shall I do? What do I mean? Why
do I care what he thinks, beyond the mere loss of his good opinion as
regards my telling the truth or not? I cannot tell. But I am very
miserable! Oh, how unhappy this last year has been! I have passed out of
childhood into old age. I have had no youth--no womanhood; the hopes of
womanhood have closed for me--for I shall never marry; and I anticipate
cares and sorrows just as if I were an old woman, and with the same
fearful spirit. I am weary of this continual call upon me for strength.
I could bear up for papa; because that is a natural, pious duty. And I
think I could bear up against--at any rate, I could have the energy to
resent, Mrs. Thornton's unjust, impertinent suspicions. But it is hard
to feel how completely he must misunderstand me. What has happened to
make me so morbid to-day? I do not know. I only know I cannot help it. I
must give way sometimes. No, I will not, though,' said she, springing to
her feet. 'I will not--I _will_ not think of myself and my own position.
I won't examine into my own feelings. It would be of no use now. Some
time, if I live to be an old woman, I may sit over the fire, and,
looking into the embers, see the life that might have been.'

All this time, she was hastily putting on her things to go out, only
stopping from time to time to wipe her eyes, with an impatience of
gesture at the tears that would come, in spite of all her bravery.

'I dare say, there's many a woman makes as sad a mistake as I have done,
and only finds it out too late. And how proudly and impertinently I
spoke to him that day! But I did not know then. It has come upon me
little by little, and I don't know where it began. Now I won't give way.
I shall find it difficult to behave in the same way to him, with this
miserable consciousness upon me; but I will be very calm and very quiet,
and say very little. But, to be sure, I may not see him; he keeps out of
our way evidently. That would be worse than all. And yet no wonder that
he avoids me, believing what he must about me.'

She went out, going rapidly towards the country, and trying to drown
reflection by swiftness of motion.

As she stood on the door-step, at her return, her father came up:

'Good girl!' said he. 'You've been to Mrs. Boucher's. I was just meaning
to go there, if I had time, before dinner.'

'No, papa; I have not,' said Margaret, reddening. 'I never thought about
her. But I will go directly after dinner; I will go while you are taking
your nap.'

Accordingly Margaret went. Mrs. Boucher was very ill; really ill--not
merely ailing. The kind and sensible neighbour, who had come in the
other day, seemed to have taken charge of everything. Some of the
children were gone to the neighbours. Mary Higgins had come for the
three youngest at dinner-time; and since then Nicholas had gone for the
doctor. He had not come as yet; Mrs. Boucher was dying; and there was
nothing to do but to wait. Margaret thought that she should like to know
his opinion, and that she could not do better than go and see the
Higginses in the meantime. She might then possibly hear whether Nicholas
had been able to make his application to Mr. Thornton.

She found Nicholas busily engaged in making a penny spin on the dresser,
for the amusement of three little children, who were clinging to him in
a fearless manner. He, as well as they, was smiling at a good long spin;
and Margaret thought, that the happy look of interest in his occupation
was a good sign. When the penny stopped spinning, 'lile Johnnie' began
to cry.

'Come to me,' said Margaret, taking him off the dresser, and holding him
in her arms; she held her watch to his ear, while she asked Nicholas if
he had seen Mr. Thornton.

The look on his face changed instantly.

'Ay!' said he. 'I've seen and heerd too much on him.'

'He refused you, then?' said Margaret, sorrowfully.

'To be sure. I knew he'd do it all long. It's no good expecting marcy at
the hands o' them measters. Yo're a stranger and a foreigner, and aren't
likely to know their ways; but I knowed it.'

'I am sorry I asked you. Was he angry? He did not speak to you as Hamper
did, did he?'

'He weren't o'er-civil!' said Nicholas, spinning the penny again, as
much for his own amusement as for that of the children. 'Never yo' fret,
I'm only where I was. I'll go on tramp to-morrow. I gave him as good as
I got. I telled him, I'd not that good opinion on him that I'd ha' come
a second time of mysel'; but yo'd advised me for to come, and I were
beholden to yo'.'

'You told him I sent you?'

'I dunno' if I ca'd yo' by your name. I dunnot think I did. I said, a
woman who knew no better had advised me for to come and see if there was
a soft place in his heart.'

'And he--?' asked Margaret.

'Said I were to tell yo' to mind yo'r own business.--That's the longest
spin yet, my lads.--And them's civil words to what he used to me. But
ne'er mind. We're but where we was; and I'll break stones on th' road
afore I let these little uns clem.'

Margaret put the struggling Johnnie out of her arms, back into his
former place on the dresser.

'I am sorry I asked you to go to Mr. Thornton's. I am disappointed in
him.'

There was a slight noise behind her. Both she and Nicholas turned round
at the same moment, and there stood Mr. Thornton, with a look of
displeased surprise upon his face. Obeying her swift impulse, Margaret
passed out before him, saying not a word, only bowing low to hide the
sudden paleness that she felt had come over her face. He bent equally
low in return, and then closed the door after her. As she hurried to
Mrs. Boucher's, she heard the clang, and it seemed to fill up the
measure of her mortification. He too was annoyed to find her there. He
had tenderness in his heart--'a soft place,' as Nicholas Higgins called
it; but he had some pride in concealing it; he kept it very sacred and
safe, and was jealous of every circumstance that tried to gain
admission. But if he dreaded exposure of his tenderness, he was equally
desirous that all men should recognise his justice; and he felt that he
had been unjust, in giving so scornful a hearing to any one who had
waited, with humble patience, for five hours, to speak to him. That the
man had spoken saucily to him when he had the opportunity, was nothing
to Mr. Thornton. He rather liked him for it; and he was conscious of his
own irritability of temper at the time, which probably made them both
quits. It was the five hours of waiting that struck Mr. Thornton. He had
not five hours to spare himself; but one hour--two hours, of his hard
penetrating intellectual, as well as bodily labour, did he give up to
going about collecting evidence as to the truth of Higgins's story, the
nature of his character, the tenor of his life. He tried not to be, but
was convinced that all that Higgins had said was true. And then the
conviction went in, as if by some spell, and touched the latent
tenderness of his heart; the patience of the man, the simple generosity
of the motive (for he had learnt about the quarrel between Boucher and
Higgins), made him forget entirely the mere reasonings of justice, and
overleap them by a diviner instinct. He came to tell Higgins he would
give him work; and he was more annoyed to find Margaret there than by
hearing her last words, for then he understood that she was the woman
who had urged Higgins to come to him; and he dreaded the admission of
any thought of her, as a motive to what he was doing solely because it
was right.

'So that was the lady you spoke of as a woman?' said he indignantly to
Higgins. 'You might have told me who she was.

'And then, maybe, yo'd ha' spoken of her more civil than yo' did; yo'd
getten a mother who might ha' kept yo'r tongue in check when yo' were
talking o' women being at the root o' all the plagues.'

'Of course you told that to Miss Hale?'

'In coorse I did. Leastways, I reckon I did. I telled her she weren't to
meddle again in aught that concerned yo'.'

'Whose children are those--yours?' Mr. Thornton had a pretty good notion
whose they were, from what he had heard; but he felt awkward in turning
the conversation round from this unpromising beginning.

'They're not mine, and they are mine.'

'They are the children you spoke of to me this morning?'

'When yo' said,' replied Higgins, turning round, with ill-smothered
fierceness, 'that my story might be true or might not, bur it were a
very unlikely one. Measter, I've not forgetten.'

Mr. Thornton was silent for a moment; then he said: 'No more have I. I
remember what I said. I spoke to you about those children in a way I had
no business to do. I did not believe you. I could not have taken care of
another man's children myself, if he had acted towards me as I hear
Boucher did towards you. But I know now that you spoke truth. I beg your
pardon.'

Higgins did not turn round, or immediately respond to this. But when he
did speak, it was in a softened tone, although the words were gruff
enough.

'Yo've no business to go prying into what happened between Boucher and
me. He's dead, and I'm sorry. That's enough.'

'So it is. Will you take work with me? That's what I came to ask.'

Higgins's obstinacy wavered, recovered strength, and stood firm. He
would not speak. Mr. Thornton would not ask again. Higgins's eye fell on
the children.

'Yo've called me impudent, and a liar, and a mischief-maker, and yo'
might ha' said wi' some truth, as I were now and then given to drink.
An' I ha' called you a tyrant, an' an oud bull-dog, and a hard, cruel
master; that's where it stands. But for th' childer. Measter, do yo'
think we can e'er get on together?'

'Well!' said Mr. Thornton, half-laughing, 'it was not my proposal that
we should go together. But there's one comfort, on your own showing. We
neither of us can think much worse of the other than we do now.'

'That's true,' said Higgins, reflectively. 'I've been thinking, ever
sin' I saw you, what a marcy it were yo' did na take me on, for that I
ne'er saw a man whom I could less abide. But that's maybe been a hasty
judgment; and work's work to such as me. So, measter, I'll come; and
what's more, I thank yo'; and that's a deal fro' me,' said he, more
frankly, suddenly turning round and facing Mr. Thornton fully for the
first time.

'And this is a deal from me,' said Mr. Thornton, giving Higgins's hand a
good grip. 'Now mind you come sharp to your time,' continued he,
resuming the master. 'I'll have no laggards at my mill. What fines we
have, we keep pretty sharply. And the first time I catch you making
mischief, off you go. So now you know where you are.'

'Yo' spoke of my wisdom this morning. I reckon I may bring it wi' me; or
would yo' rayther have me 'bout my brains?'

''Bout your brains if you use them for meddling with my business; with
your brains if you can keep them to your own.'

'I shall need a deal o' brains to settle where my business ends and
yo'rs begins.'

'Your business has not begun yet, and mine stands still for me. So good
afternoon.'

Just before Mr. Thornton came up to Mrs. Boucher's door, Margaret came
out of it. She did not see him; and he followed her for several yards,
admiring her light and easy walk, and her tall and graceful figure. But,
suddenly, this simple emotion of pleasure was tainted, poisoned by
jealousy. He wished to overtake her, and speak to her, to see how she
would receive him, now she must know he was aware of some other
attachment. He wished too, but of this wish he was rather ashamed, that
she should know that he had justified her wisdom in sending Higgins to
him to ask for work; and had repented him of his morning's decision. He
came up to her. She started.

'Allow me to say, Miss Hale, that you were rather premature in
expressing your disappointment. I have taken Higgins on.'

'I am glad of it,' said she, coldly.

'He tells me, he repeated to you, what I said this morning about--' Mr.
Thornton hesitated. Margaret took it up:

'About women not meddling. You had a perfect right to express your
opinion, which was a very correct one, I have no doubt. But,' she went
on a little more eagerly, 'Higgins did not quite tell you the exact
truth.' The word 'truth,' reminded her of her own untruth, and she
stopped short, feeling exceedingly uncomfortable.

Mr. Thornton at first was puzzled to account for her silence; and then
he remembered the lie she had told, and all that was foregone. 'The
exact truth!' said he. 'Very few people do speak the exact truth. I have
given up hoping for it. Miss Hale, have you no explanation to give me?
You must perceive what I cannot but think.'

Margaret was silent. She was wondering whether an explanation of any
kind would be consistent with her loyalty to Frederick.

'Nay,' said he, 'I will ask no farther. I may be putting temptation in
your way. At present, believe me, your secret is safe with me. But you
run great risks, allow me to say, in being so indiscreet. I am now only
speaking as a friend of your father's: if I had any other thought or
hope, of course that is at an end. I am quite disinterested.'

'I am aware of that,' said Margaret, forcing herself to speak in an
indifferent, careless way. 'I am aware of what I must appear to you, but
the secret is another person's, and I cannot explain it without doing
him harm.'

'I have not the slightest wish to pry into the gentleman's secrets,' he
said, with growing anger. 'My own interest in you is--simply that of a
friend. You may not believe me, Miss Hale, but it is--in spite of the
persecution I'm afraid I threatened you with at one time--but that is
all given up; all passed away. You believe me, Miss Hale?'

'Yes,' said Margaret, quietly and sadly.

'Then, really, I don't see any occasion for us to go on walking
together. I thought, perhaps you might have had something to say, but I
see we are nothing to each other. If you're quite convinced, that any
foolish passion on my part is entirely over, I will wish you good
afternoon.' He walked off very hastily.

'What can he mean?' thought Margaret,--'what could he mean by speaking
so, as if I were always thinking that he cared for me, when I know he
does not; he cannot. His mother will have said all those cruel things
about me to him. But I won't care for him. I surely am mistress enough
of myself to control this wild, strange, miserable feeling, which
tempted me even to betray my own dear Frederick, so that I might but
regain his good opinion--the good opinion of a man who takes such pains
to tell me that I am nothing to him. Come poor little heart! be cheery
and brave. We'll be a great deal to one another, if we are thrown off
and left desolate.'

Her father was almost startled by her merriment this afternoon. She
talked incessantly, and forced her natural humour to an unusual pitch;
and if there was a tinge of bitterness in much of what she said; if her
accounts of the old Harley Street set were a little sarcastic, her
father could not bear to check her, as he would have done at another
time--for he was glad to see her shake off her cares. In the middle of
the evening, she was called down to speak to Mary Higgins; and when she
came back, Mr. Hale imagined that he saw traces of tears on her cheeks.
But that could not be, for she brought good news--that Higgins had got
work at Mr. Thornton's mill. Her spirits were damped, at any rate, and
she found it very difficult to go on talking at all, much more in the
wild way that she had done. For some days her spirits varied strangely;
and her father was beginning to be anxious about her, when news arrived
from one or two quarters that promised some change and variety for her.
Mr. Hale received a letter from Mr. Bell, in which that gentleman
volunteered a visit to them; and Mr. Hale imagined that the promised
society of his old Oxford friend would give as agreeable a turn to
Margaret's ideas as it did to his own. Margaret tried to take an
interest in what pleased her father; but she was too languid to care
about any Mr. Bell, even though he were twenty times her godfather. She
was more roused by a letter from Edith, full of sympathy about her
aunt's death; full of details about herself, her husband, and child; and
at the end saying, that as the climate did not suit, the baby, and as
Mrs. Shaw was talking of returning to England, she thought it probable
that Captain Lennox might sell out, and that they might all go and live
again in the old Harley Street house; which, however, would seem very
incomplete with-out Margaret. Margaret yearned after that old house, and
the placid tranquillity of that old well-ordered, monotonous life. She
had found it occasionally tiresome while it lasted; but since then she
had been buffeted about, and felt so exhausted by this recent struggle
with herself, that she thought that even stagnation would be a rest and
a refreshment. So she began to look towards a long visit to the
Lennoxes, on their return to England, as to a point--no, not of
hope--but of leisure, in which she could regain her power and command
over herself. At present it seemed to her as if all subjects tended
towards Mr. Thornton; as if she could not forget him with all her
endeavours. If she went to see the Higginses, she heard of him there;
her father had resumed their readings together, and quoted his opinions
perpetually; even Mr. Bell's visit brought his tenant's name upon the
tapis; for he wrote word that he believed he must be occupied some great
part of his time with Mr. Thornton, as a new lease was in preparation,
and the terms of it must be agreed upon.




CHAPTER XL

OUT OF TUNE

    'I have no wrong, where I can claim no right,
     Naught ta'en me fro, where I have nothing had,
     Yet of my woe I cannot so be quite;
     Namely, since that another may be glad
     With that, that thus in sorrow makes me sad.'
             WYATT.


Margaret had not expected much pleasure to herself from Mr. Bell's
visit--she had only looked forward to it on her father's account, but
when her godfather came, she at once fell into the most natural position
of friendship in the world. He said she had no merit in being what she
was, a girl so entirely after his own heart; it was an hereditary power
which she had, to walk in and take possession of his regard; while she,
in reply, gave him much credit for being so fresh and young under his
Fellow's cap and gown.

'Fresh and young in warmth and kindness, I mean. I'm afraid I must own,
that I think your opinions are the oldest and mustiest I have met with
this long time.'

'Hear this daughter of yours, Hale. Her residence in Milton has quite
corrupted her. She's a democrat, a red republican, a member of the Peace
Society, a socialist--'

'Papa, it's all because I'm standing up for the progress of commerce.
Mr. Bell would have had it keep still at exchanging wild-beast skins for
acorns.'

'No, no. I'd dig the ground and grow potatoes. And I'd shave the
wild-beast skins and make the wool into broad cloth. Don't exaggerate,
missy. But I'm tired of this bustle. Everybody rushing over everybody,
in their hurry to get rich.'

'It is not every one who can sit comfortably in a set of college rooms,
and let his riches grow without any exertion of his own. No doubt there
is many a man here who would be thankful if his property would increase
as yours has done, without his taking any trouble about it,' said Mr.
Hale.

'I don't believe they would. It's the bustle and the struggle they like.
As for sitting still, and learning from the past, or shaping out the
future by faithful work done in a prophetic spirit--Why! Pooh! I don't
believe there's a man in Milton who knows how to sit still; and it is a
great art.'

'Milton people, I suspect, think Oxford men don't know how to move. It
would be a very good thing if they mixed a little more.'

'It might be good for the Miltoners. Many things might be good for them
which would be very disagreeable for other people.'

'Are you not a Milton man yourself?' asked Margaret. 'I should have
thought you would have been proud of your town.'

'I confess, I don't see what there is to be proud of. If you'll only
come to Oxford, Margaret, I will show you a place to glory in.'

'Well!' said Mr. Hale, 'Mr. Thornton is coming to drink tea with us
to-night, and he is as proud of Milton as you of Oxford. You two must
try and make each other a little more liberal-minded.'

'I don't want to be more liberal-minded, thank you,' said Mr. Bell.

'Is Mr. Thornton coming to tea, papa?' asked Margaret in a low voice.

'Either to tea or soon after. He could not tell. He told us not to
wait.'

Mr. Thornton had determined that he would make no inquiry of his mother
as to how far she had put her project into execution of speaking to
Margaret about the impropriety of her conduct. He felt pretty sure that,
if this interview took place, his mother's account of what passed at it
would only annoy and chagrin him, though he would all the time be aware
of the colouring which it received by passing through her mind. He
shrank from hearing Margaret's very name mentioned; he, while he blamed
her--while he was jealous of her--while he renounced her--he loved her
sorely, in spite of himself. He dreamt of her; he dreamt she came
dancing towards him with outspread arms, and with a lightness and gaiety
which made him loathe her, even while it allured him. But the impression
of this figure of Margaret--with all Margaret's character taken out of
it, as completely as if some evil spirit had got possession of her
form--was so deeply stamped upon his imagination, that when he wakened
he felt hardly able to separate the Una from the Duessa; and the dislike
he had to the latter seemed to envelope and disfigure the former. Yet he
was too proud to acknowledge his weakness by avoiding the sight of her.
He would neither seek an opportunity of being in her company nor avoid
it. To convince himself of his power of self-control, he lingered over
every piece of business this afternoon; he forced every movement into
unnatural slowness and deliberation; and it was consequently past eight
o'clock before he reached Mr. Hale's. Then there were business
arrangements to be transacted in the study with Mr. Bell; and the latter
kept on, sitting over the fire, and talking wearily, long after all
business was transacted, and when they might just as well have gone
upstairs. But Mr. Thornton would not say a word about moving their
quarters; he chafed and chafed, and thought Mr. Bell a most prosy
companion; while Mr. Bell returned the compliment in secret, by
considering Mr. Thornton about as brusque and curt a fellow as he had
ever met with, and terribly gone off both in intelligence and manner. At
last, some slight noise in the room above suggested the desirableness of
moving there. They found Margaret with a letter open before her, eagerly
discussing its contents with her father. On the entrance of the
gentlemen, it was immediately put aside; but Mr. Thornton's eager senses
caught some few words of Mr. Hale's to Mr. Bell.

'A letter from Henry Lennox. It makes Margaret very hopeful.'

Mr. Bell nodded. Margaret was red as a rose when Mr. Thornton looked at
her. He had the greatest mind in the world to get up and go out of the
room that very instant, and never set foot in the house again.

'We were thinking,' said Mr. Hale, 'that you and Mr. Thornton had taken
Margaret's advice, and were each trying to convert the other, you were
so long in the study.'

'And you thought there would be nothing left of us but an opinion, like
the Kilkenny cat's tail. Pray whose opinion did you think would have the
most obstinate vitality?'

Mr. Thornton had not a notion what they were talking about, and
disdained to inquire. Mr. Hale politely enlightened him.

'Mr. Thornton, we were accusing Mr. Bell this morning of a kind of
Oxonian mediaeval bigotry against his native town; and we--Margaret, I
believe--suggested that it would do him good to associate a little with
Milton manufacturers.'

'I beg your pardon. Margaret thought it would do the Milton
manufacturers good to associate a little more with Oxford men. Now
wasn't it so, Margaret?'

'I believe I thought it would do both good to see a little more of the
other,--I did not know it was my idea any more than papa's.'

'And so you see, Mr. Thornton, we ought to have been improving each
other down-stairs, instead of talking over vanished families of Smiths
and Harrisons. However, I am willing to do my part now. I wonder when
you Milton men intend to live. All your lives seem to be spent in
gathering together the materials for life.'

'By living, I suppose you mean enjoyment.'

'Yes, enjoyment,--I don't specify of what, because I trust we should
both consider mere pleasure as very poor enjoyment.'

'I would rather have the nature of the enjoyment defined.'

'Well! enjoyment of leisure--enjoyment of the power and influence which
money gives. You are all striving for money. What do you want it for?'

Mr. Thornton was silent. Then he said, 'I really don't know. But money
is not what _I_ strive for.'

'What then?'

'It is a home question. I shall have to lay myself open to such a
catechist, and I am not sure that I am prepared to do it.'

'No!' said Mr. Hale; 'don't let us be personal in our catechism. You are
neither of you representative men; you are each of you too individual
for that.'

'I am not sure whether to consider that as a compliment or not. I should
like to be the representative of Oxford, with its beauty and its
learning, and its proud old history. What do you say, Margaret; ought I
to be flattered?'

'I don't know Oxford. But there is a difference between being the
representative of a city and the representative man of its inhabitants.'

'Very true, Miss Margaret. Now I remember, you were against me this
morning, and were quite Miltonian and manufacturing in your
preferences.' Margaret saw the quick glance of surprise that Mr.
Thornton gave her, and she was annoyed at the construction which he
might put on this speech of Mr. Bell's. Mr. Bell went on--

'Ah! I wish I could show you our High Street--our Radcliffe Square. I am
leaving out our colleges, just as I give Mr. Thornton leave to omit his
factories in speaking of the charms of Milton. I have a right to abuse
my birth-place. Remember I am a Milton man.

Mr. Thornton was annoyed more than he ought to have been at all that Mr.
Bell was saying. He was not in a mood for joking. At another time, he
could have enjoyed Mr. Bell's half testy condemnation of a town where
the life was so at variance with every habit he had formed; but now, he
was galled enough to attempt to defend what was never meant to be
seriously attacked.

'I don't set up Milton as a model of a town.'

'Not in architecture?' slyly asked Mr. Bell.

'No! We've been too busy to attend to mere outward appearances.'

'Don't say _mere_ outward appearances,' said Mr. Hale, gently. 'They
impress us all, from childhood upward--every day of our life.'

'Wait a little while,' said Mr. Thornton. 'Remember, we are of a
different race from the Greeks, to whom beauty was everything, and to
whom Mr. Bell might speak of a life of leisure and serene enjoyment,
much of which entered in through their outward senses. I don't mean to
despise them, any more than I would ape them. But I belong to Teutonic
blood; it is little mingled in this part of England to what it is in
others; we retain much of their language; we retain more of their
spirit; we do not look upon life as a time for enjoyment, but as a time
for action and exertion. Our glory and our beauty arise out of our
inward strength, which makes us victorious over material resistance, and
over greater difficulties still. We are Teutonic up here in Darkshire in
another way. We hate to have laws made for us at a distance. We wish
people would allow us to right ourselves, instead of continually
meddling, with their imperfect legislation. We stand up for
self-government, and oppose centralisation.'

'In short, you would like the Heptarchy back again. Well, at any rate, I
revoke what I said this morning--that you Milton people did not
reverence the past. You are regular worshippers of Thor.'

'If we do not reverence the past as you do in Oxford, it is because we
want something which can apply to the present more directly. It is fine
when the study of the past leads to a prophecy of the future. But to men
groping in new circumstances, it would be finer if the words of
experience could direct us how to act in what concerns us most
intimately and immediately; which is full of difficulties that must be
encountered; and upon the mode in which they are met and conquered--not
merely pushed aside for the time--depends our future. Out of the wisdom
of the past, help us over the present. But no! People can speak of
Utopia much more easily than of the next day's duty; and yet when that
duty is all done by others, who so ready to cry, "Fie, for shame!"'

'And all this time I don't see what you are talking about. Would you
Milton men condescend to send up your to-day's difficulty to Oxford? You
have not tried us yet.'

Mr. Thornton laughed outright at this. 'I believe I was talking with
reference to a good deal that has been troubling us of late; I was
thinking of the strikes we have gone through, which are troublesome and
injurious things enough, as I am finding to my cost. And yet this last
strike, under which I am smarting, has been respectable.'

'A respectable strike!' said Mr. Bell. 'That sounds as if you were far
gone in the worship of Thor.'

Margaret felt, rather than saw, that Mr. Thornton was chagrined by the
repeated turning into jest of what he was feeling as very serious. She
tried to change the conversation from a subject about which one party
cared little, while, to the other, it was deeply, because personally,
interesting. She forced herself to say something.

'Edith says she finds the printed calicoes in Corfu better and cheaper
than in London.'

'Does she?' said her father. 'I think that must be one of Edith's
exaggerations. Are you sure of it, Margaret?'

'I am sure she says so, papa.'

'Then I am sure of the fact,' said Mr. Bell. 'Margaret, I go so far in
my idea of your truthfulness, that it shall cover your cousin's
character. I don't believe a cousin of yours could exaggerate.'

'Is Miss Hale so remarkable for truth?' said Mr. Thornton, bitterly. The
moment he had done so, he could have bitten his tongue out. What was he?
And why should he stab her with her shame in this way? How evil he was
to-night; possessed by ill-humour at being detained so long from her;
irritated by the mention of some name, because he thought it belonged to
a more successful lover; now ill-tempered because he had been unable to
cope, with a light heart, against one who was trying, by gay and
careless speeches, to make the evening pass pleasantly away,--the kind
old friend to all parties, whose manner by this time might be well known
to Mr. Thornton, who had been acquainted with him for many years. And
then to speak to Margaret as he had done! She did not get up and leave
the room, as she had done in former days, when his abruptness or his
temper had annoyed her. She sat quite still, after the first momentary
glance of grieved surprise, that made her eyes look like some child's
who has met with an unexpected rebuff; they slowly dilated into
mournful, reproachful sadness; and then they fell, and she bent over her
work, and did not speak again. But he could not help looking at her, and
he saw a sigh tremble over her body, as if she quivered in some unwonted
chill. He felt as the mother would have done, in the midst of 'her
rocking it, and rating it,' had she been called away before her slow
confiding smile, implying perfect trust in mother's love, had proved the
renewing of its love. He gave short sharp answers; he was uneasy and
cross, unable to discern between jest and earnest; anxious only for a
look, a word of hers, before which to prostrate himself in penitent
humility. But she neither looked nor spoke. Her round taper fingers flew
in and out of her sewing, as steadily and swiftly as if that were the
business of her life. She could not care for him, he thought, or else
the passionate fervour of his wish would have forced her to raise those
eyes, if but for an instant, to read the late repentance in his. He
could have struck her before he left, in order that by some strange
overt act of rudeness, he might earn the privilege of telling her the
remorse that gnawed at his heart. It was well that the long walk in the
open air wound up this evening for him. It sobered him back into grave
resolution, that henceforth he would see as little of her as
possible,--since the very sight of that face and form, the very sounds
of that voice (like the soft winds of pure melody) had such power to
move him from his balance. Well! He had known what love was--a sharp
pang, a fierce experience, in the midst of whose flames he was
struggling! but, through that furnace he would fight his way out into
the serenity of middle age,--all the richer and more human for having
known this great passion.

When he had somewhat abruptly left the room, Margaret rose from her
seat, and began silently to fold up her work; the long seams were heavy,
and had an unusual weight for her languid arms. The round lines in her
face took a lengthened, straighter form, and her whole appearance was
that of one who had gone through a day of great fatigue. As the three
prepared for bed, Mr. Bell muttered forth a little condemnation of Mr.
Thornton.

'I never saw a fellow so spoiled by success. He can't bear a word; a
jest of any kind. Everything seems to touch on the soreness of his high
dignity. Formerly, he was as simple and noble as the open day; you could
not offend him, because he had no vanity.'

'He is not vain now,' said Margaret, turning round from the table, and
speaking with quiet distinctness. 'To-night he has not been like
himself. Something must have annoyed him before he came here.'

Mr. Bell gave her one of his sharp glances from above his spectacles.
She stood it quite calmly; but, after she had left the room, he suddenly
asked,--

'Hale! did it ever strike you that Thornton and your daughter have what
the French call a tendresse for each other?'

'Never!' said Mr. Hale, first startled and then flurried by the new
idea. 'No, I am sure you are wrong. I am almost certain you are
mistaken. If there is anything, it is all on Mr. Thornton's side. Poor
fellow! I hope and trust he is not thinking of her, for I am sure she
would not have him.'

'Well! I'm a bachelor, and have steered clear of love affairs all my
life; so perhaps my opinion is not worth having. Or else I should say
there were very pretty symptoms about her!'

'Then I am sure you are wrong,' said Mr. Hale. 'He may care for her,
though she really has been almost rude to him at times. But she!--why,
Margaret would never think of him, I'm sure! Such a thing has never
entered her head.'

'Entering her heart would do. But I merely threw out a suggestion of
what might be. I dare say I was wrong. And whether I was wrong or right,
I'm very sleepy; so, having disturbed your night's rest (as I can see)
with my untimely fancies, I'll betake myself with an easy mind to my
own.'

But Mr. Hale resolved that he would not be disturbed by any such
nonsensical idea; so he lay awake, determining not to think about it.

Mr. Bell took his leave the next day, bidding Margaret look to him as
one who had a right to help and protect her in all her troubles, of
whatever nature they might be. To Mr. Hale he said,--

'That Margaret of yours has gone deep into my heart. Take care of her,
for she is a very precious creature,--a great deal too good for
Milton,--only fit for Oxford, in fact. The town, I mean; not the men. I
can't match her yet. When I can, I shall bring my young man to stand
side by side with your young woman, just as the genie in the Arabian
Nights brought Prince Caralmazan to match with the fairy's Princess
Badoura.'

'I beg you'll do no such thing. Remember the misfortunes that ensued;
and besides, I can't spare Margaret.'

'No; on second thoughts, we'll have her to nurse us ten years hence,
when we shall be two cross old invalids. Seriously, Hale! I wish you'd
leave Milton; which is a most unsuitable place for you, though it was my
recommendation in the first instance. If you would; I'd swallow my
shadows of doubts, and take a college living; and you and Margaret
should come and live at the parsonage--you to be a sort of lay curate,
and take the unwashed off my hands; and she to be our housekeeper--the
village Lady Bountiful--by day; and read us to sleep in the evenings. I
could be very happy in such a life. What do you think of it?'

'Never!' said Mr. Hale, decidedly. 'My one great change has been made
and my price of suffering paid. Here I stay out my life; and here will I
be buried, and lost in the crowd.'

'I don't give up my plan yet. Only I won't bait you with it any more
just now. Where's the Pearl? Come, Margaret, give me a farewell kiss;
and remember, my dear, where you may find a true friend, as far as his
capability goes. You are my child, Margaret. Remember that, and 'God
bless you!'

So they fell back into the monotony of the quiet life they would
henceforth lead. There was no invalid to hope and fear about; even the
Higginses--so long a vivid interest--seemed to have receded from any
need of immediate thought. The Boucher children, left motherless
orphans, claimed what of Margaret's care she could bestow; and she went
pretty often to see Mary Higgins, who had charge of them. The two
families were living in one house: the elder children were at humble
schools, the younger ones were tended, in Mary's absence at her work, by
the kind neighbour whose good sense had struck Margaret at the time of
Boucher's death. Of course she was paid for her trouble; and indeed, in
all his little plans and arrangements for these orphan children,
Nicholas showed a sober judgment, and regulated method of thinking,
which were at variance with his former more eccentric jerks of action.
He was so steady at his work, that Margaret did not often see him during
these winter months; but when she did, she saw that he winced away from
any reference to the father of those children, whom he had so fully and
heartily taken under his care. He did not speak easily of Mr. Thornton.

'To tell the truth,' said he, 'he fairly bamboozles me. He's two chaps.
One chap I knowed of old as were measter all o'er. T'other chap hasn't
an ounce of measter's flesh about him. How them two chaps is bound up in
one body, is a craddy for me to find out. I'll not be beat by it,
though. Meanwhile he comes here pretty often; that's how I know the chap
that's a man, not a measter. And I reckon he's taken aback by me pretty
much as I am by him; for he sits and listens and stares, as if I were
some strange beast newly caught in some of the zones. But I'm none
daunted. It would take a deal to daunt me in my own house, as he sees.
And I tell him some of my mind that I reckon he'd ha' been the better of
hearing when he were a younger man.'

'And does he not answer you?' asked Mr. Hale.

'Well! I'll not say th' advantage is all on his side, for all I take
credit for improving him above a bit. Sometimes he says a rough thing or
two, which is not agreeable to look at at first, but has a queer smack
o' truth in it when yo' come to chew it. He'll be coming to-night, I
reckon, about them childer's schooling. He's not satisfied wi' the make
of it, and wants for t' examine 'em.'

'What are they'--began Mr. Hale; but Margaret, touching his arm, showed
him her watch.

'It is nearly seven,' she said. 'The evenings are getting longer now.
Come, papa.' She did not breathe freely till they were some distance
from the house. Then, as she became more calm, she wished that she had
not been in so great a hurry; for, somehow, they saw Mr. Thornton but
very seldom now; and he might have come to see Higgins, and for the old
friendship's sake she should like to have seen him to-night.

Yes! he came very seldom, even for the dull cold purpose of lessons. Mr.
Hale was disappointed in his pupil's lukewarmness about Greek
literature, which had but a short time ago so great an interest for him.
And now it often happened that a hurried note from Mr. Thornton would
arrive, just at the last moment, saying that he was so much engaged that
he could not come to read with Mr. Hale that evening. And though other
pupils had taken more than his place as to time, no one was like his
first scholar in Mr. Hale's heart. He was depressed and sad at this
partial cessation of an intercourse which had become dear to him; and he
used to sit pondering over the reason that could have occasioned this
change.

He startled Margaret, one evening as she sate at her work, by suddenly
asking:

'Margaret! had you ever any reason for thinking that Mr. Thornton cared
for you?'

He almost blushed as he put this question; but Mr. Bell's scouted idea
recurred to him, and the words were out of his mouth before he well knew
what he was about.

Margaret did not answer immediately; but by the bent drooping of her
head, he guessed what her reply would be.

'Yes; I believe--oh papa, I should have told you.' And she dropped her
work, and hid her face in her hands.

'No, dear; don't think that I am impertinently curious. I am sure you
would have told me if you had felt that you could return his regard. Did
he speak to you about it?'

No answer at first; but by-and-by a little gentle reluctant 'Yes.'

'And you refused him?'

A long sigh; a more helpless, nerveless attitude, and another 'Yes.' But
before her father could speak, Margaret lifted up her face, rosy with
some beautiful shame, and, fixing her eyes upon him, said:

'Now, papa, I have told you this, and I cannot tell you more; and then
the whole thing is so painful to me; every word and action connected
with it is so unspeakably bitter, that I cannot bear to think of it. Oh,
papa, I am sorry to have lost you this friend, but I could not help
it--but oh! I am very sorry.' She sate down on the ground, and laid her
head on his knees.

'I too, am sorry, my dear. Mr. Bell quite startled me when he said, some
idea of the kind--'

'Mr. Bell! Oh, did Mr. Bell see it?'

'A little; but he took it into his head that you--how shall I say
it?--that you were not ungraciously disposed towards Mr. Thornton. I
knew that could never be. I hoped the whole thing was but an
imagination; but I knew too well what your real feelings were to suppose
that you could ever like Mr. Thornton in that way. But I am very sorry.'

They were very quiet and still for some minutes. But, on stroking her
cheek in a caressing way soon after, he was almost shocked to find her
face wet with tears. As he touched her, she sprang up, and smiling with
forced brightness, began to talk of the Lennoxes with such a vehement
desire to turn the conversation, that Mr. Hale was too tender-hearted to
try to force it back into the old channel.

'To-morrow--yes, to-morrow they will be back in Harley Street. Oh, how
strange it will be! I wonder what room they will make into the nursery?
Aunt Shaw will be happy with the baby. Fancy Edith a mamma! And Captain
Lennox--I wonder what he will do with himself now he has sold out!'

'I'll tell you what,' said her father, anxious to indulge her in this
fresh subject of interest, 'I think I must spare you for a fortnight
just to run up to town and see the travellers. You could learn more, by
half an hour's conversation with Mr. Henry Lennox, about Frederick's
chances, than in a dozen of these letters of his; so it would, in fact,
be uniting business with pleasure.'

'No, papa, you cannot spare me, and what's more, I won't be spared.'
Then after a pause, she added: 'I am losing hope sadly about Frederick;
he is letting us down gently, but I can see that Mr. Lennox himself has
no hope of hunting up the witnesses under years and years of time. No,'
said she, 'that bubble was very pretty, and very dear to our hearts; but
it has burst like many another; and we must console ourselves with being
glad that Frederick is so happy, and with being a great deal to each
other. So don't offend me by talking of being able to spare me, papa,
for I assure you you can't.'

But the idea of a change took root and germinated in Margaret's heart,
although not in the way in which her father proposed it at first. She
began to consider how desirable something of the kind would be to her
father, whose spirits, always feeble, now became too frequently
depressed, and whose health, though he never complained, had been
seriously affected by his wife's illness and death. There were the
regular hours of reading with his pupils, but that all giving and no
receiving could no longer be called companion-ship, as in the old days
when Mr. Thornton came to study under him. Margaret was conscious of the
want under which he was suffering, unknown to himself; the want of a
man's intercourse with men. At Helstone there had been perpetual
occasions for an interchange of visits with neighbouring clergymen; and
the poor labourers in the fields, or leisurely tramping home at eve, or
tending their cattle in the forest, were always at liberty to speak or
be spoken to. But in Milton every one was too busy for quiet speech, or
any ripened intercourse of thought; what they said was about business,
very present and actual; and when the tension of mind relating to their
daily affairs was over, they sunk into fallow rest until next morning.
The workman was not to be found after the day's work was done; he had
gone away to some lecture, or some club, or some beer-shop, according to
his degree of character. Mr. Hale thought of trying to deliver a course
of lectures at some of the institutions, but he contemplated doing this
so much as an effort of duty, and with so little of the genial impulse
of love towards his work and its end, that Margaret was sure that it
would not be well done until he could look upon it with some kind of
zest.




CHAPTER XLI

THE JOURNEY'S END

    'I see my way as birds their trackless way--
     I shall arrive! what time, what circuit first,
     I ask not: but unless God send his hail
     Or blinding fire-balls, sleet, or stifling snow,
     In some time--his good time--I shall arrive;
     He guides me and the bird. In His good time!'
            BROWNING'S PARACELSUS.


So the winter was getting on, and the days were beginning to lengthen,
without bringing with them any of the brightness of hope which usually
accompanies the rays of a February sun. Mrs. Thornton had of course
entirely ceased to come to the house. Mr. Thornton came occasionally,
but his visits were addressed to her father, and were confined to the
study. Mr. Hale spoke of him as always the same; indeed, the very rarity
of their intercourse seemed to make Mr. Hale set only the higher value
on it. And from what Margaret could gather of what Mr. Thornton had
said, there was nothing in the cessation of his visits which could arise
from any umbrage or vexation. His business affairs had become
complicated during the strike, and required closer attention than he had
given to them last winter. Nay, Margaret could even discover that he
spoke from time to time of her, and always, as far as she could learn,
in the same calm friendly way, never avoiding and never seeking any
mention of her name.

She was not in spirits to raise her father's tone of mind. The dreary
peacefulness of the present time had been preceded by so long a period
of anxiety and care--even intermixed with storms--that her mind had lost
its elasticity. She tried to find herself occupation in teaching the two
younger Boucher children, and worked hard at goodness; hard, I say most
truly, for her heart seemed dead to the end of all her efforts; and
though she made them punctually and painfully, yet she stood as far off
as ever from any cheerfulness; her life seemed still bleak and dreary.
The only thing she did well, was what she did out of unconscious piety,
the silent comforting and consoling of her father. Not a mood of his but
what found a ready sympathiser in Margaret; not a wish of his that she
did not strive to forecast, and to fulfil. They were quiet wishes to be
sure, and hardly named without hesitation and apology. All the more
complete and beautiful was her meek spirit of obedience. March brought
the news of Frederick's marriage. He and Dolores wrote; she in
Spanish-English, as was but natural, and he with little turns and
inversions of words which proved how far the idioms of his bride's
country were infecting him.

On the receipt of Henry Lennox's letter, announcing how little hope
there was of his ever clearing himself at a court-martial, in the
absence of the missing witnesses, Frederick had written to Margaret a
pretty vehement letter, containing his renunciation of England as his
country; he wished he could unnative himself, and declared that he would
not take his pardon if it were offered him, nor live in the country if
he had permission to do so. All of which made Margaret cry sorely, so
unnatural did it seem to her at the first opening; but on consideration,
she saw rather in such expression the poignancy of the disappointment
which had thus crushed his hopes; and she felt that there was nothing
for it but patience. In the next letter, Frederick spoke so joyfully of
the future that he had no thought for the past; and Margaret found a use
in herself for the patience she had been craving for him. She would have
to be patient. But the pretty, timid, girlish letters of Dolores were
beginning to have a charm for both Margaret and her father. The young
Spaniard was so evidently anxious to make a favourable impression upon
her lover's English relations, that her feminine care peeped out at
every erasure; and the letters announcing the marriage, were accompanied
by a splendid black lace mantilla, chosen by Dolores herself for her
unseen sister-in-law, whom Frederick had represented as a paragon of
beauty, wisdom and virtue. Frederick's worldly position was raised by
this marriage on to as high a level as they could desire. Barbour and
Co. was one of the most extensive Spanish houses, and into it he was
received as a junior partner. Margaret smiled a little, and then sighed
as she remembered afresh her old tirades against trade. Here was her
preux chevalier of a brother turned merchant, trader! But then she
rebelled against herself, and protested silently against the confusion
implied between a Spanish merchant and a Milton mill-owner. Well! trade
or no trade, Frederick was very, very happy. Dolores must be charming,
and the mantilla was exquisite! And then she returned to the present
life.

Her father had occasionally experienced a difficulty in breathing this
spring, which had for the time distressed him exceedingly. Margaret was
less alarmed, as this difficulty went off completely in the intervals;
but she still was so desirous of his shaking off the liability
altogether, as to make her very urgent that he should accept Mr. Bell's
invitation to visit him at Oxford this April. Mr. Bell's invitation
included Margaret. Nay more, he wrote a special letter commanding her to
come; but she felt as if it would be a greater relief to her to remain
quietly at home, entirely free from any responsibility whatever, and so
to rest her mind and heart in a manner which she had not been able to do
for more than two years past.

When her father had driven off on his way to the railroad, Margaret felt
how great and long had been the pressure on her time and her spirits. It
was astonishing, almost stunning, to feel herself so much at liberty; no
one depending on her for cheering care, if not for positive happiness;
no invalid to plan and think for; she might be idle, and silent, and
forgetful,--and what seemed worth more than all the other
privileges--she might be unhappy if she liked. For months past, all her
own personal cares and troubles had had to be stuffed away into a dark
cupboard; but now she had leisure to take them out, and mourn over them,
and study their nature, and seek the true method of subduing them into
the elements of peace. All these weeks she had been conscious of their
existence in a dull kind of way, though they were hidden out of sight.
Now, once for all she would consider them, and appoint to each of them
its right work in her life. So she sat almost motionless for hours in
the drawing-room, going over the bitterness of every remembrance with an
unwincing resolution. Only once she cried aloud, at the stinging thought
of the faithlessness which gave birth to that abasing falsehood.

She now would not even acknowledge the force of the temptation; her
plans for Frederick had all failed, and the temptation lay there a dead
mockery,--a mockery which had never had life in it; the lie had been so
despicably foolish, seen by the light of the ensuing events, and faith
in the power of truth so infinitely the greater wisdom!

In her nervous agitation, she unconsciously opened a book of her
father's that lay upon the table,--the words that caught her eye in it,
seemed almost made for her present state of acute self-abasement:--

     'Je ne voudrois pas reprendre mon coeur en ceste sorte: meurs de
     honte, aveugle, impudent, traistre et desloyal a ton Dieu, et
     sembables choses; mais je voudrois le corriger par voye de
     compassion. Or sus, mon pauvre coeur, nous voila tombez dans la
     fosse, laquelle nous avions tant resolu d'eschapper. Ah!
     relevons-nous, et quittons-la pour jamais, reclamons la misericorde
     de Dieu, et esperons en elle qu'elle nous assistera pour desormais
     estre plus fermes; et remettons-nous au chemin de l'humilite.
     Courage, soyons meshuy sur nos gardes, Dieu nous aydera.'

'The way of humility. Ah,' thought Margaret, 'that is what I have
missed! But courage, little heart. We will turn back, and by God's help
we may find the lost path.'

So she rose up, and determined at once to set to on some work which
should take her out of herself. To begin with, she called in Martha, as
she passed the drawing-room door in going up-stairs, and tried to find
out what was below the grave, respectful, servant-like manner, which
crusted over her individual character with an obedience that was almost
mechanical. She found it difficult to induce Martha to speak of any of
her personal interests; but at last she touched the right chord, in
naming Mrs. Thornton. Martha's whole face brightened, and, on a little
encouragement, out came a long story, of how her father had been in
early life connected with Mrs. Thornton's husband--nay, had even been in
a position to show him some kindness; what, Martha hardly knew, for it
had happened when she was quite a little child; and circumstances had
intervened to separate the two families until Martha was nearly grown
up, when, her father having sunk lower and lower from his original
occupation as clerk in a warehouse, and her mother being dead, she and
her sister, to use Martha's own expression, would have been 'lost' but
for Mrs. Thornton; who sought them out, and thought for them, and cared
for them.

'I had had the fever, and was but delicate; and Mrs. Thornton, and Mr.
Thornton too, they never rested till they had nursed me up in their own
house, and sent me to the sea and all. The doctors said the fever was
catching, but they cared none for that--only Miss Fanny, and she went
a-visiting these folk that she is going to marry into. So, though she
was afraid at the time, it has all ended well.'

'Miss Fanny going to be married!' exclaimed Margaret.

'Yes; and to a rich gentleman, too, only he's a deal older than she is.
His name is Watson; and his mills are somewhere out beyond Hayleigh;
it's a very good marriage, for all he's got such gray hair.'

At this piece of information, Margaret was silent long enough for Martha
to recover her propriety, and, with it, her habitual shortness of
answer. She swept up the hearth, asked at what time she should prepare
tea, and quitted the room with the same wooden face with which she had
entered it. Margaret had to pull herself up from indulging a bad trick,
which she had lately fallen into, of trying to imagine how every event
that she heard of in relation to Mr. Thornton would affect him: whether
he would like it or dislike it.

The next day she had the little Boucher children for their lessons, and
took a long walk, and ended by a visit to Mary Higgins. Somewhat to
Margaret's surprise, she found Nicholas already come home from his work;
the lengthening light had deceived her as to the lateness of the
evening. He too seemed, by his manners, to have entered a little more on
the way of humility; he was quieter, and less self-asserting.

'So th' oud gentleman's away on his travels, is he?' said he. 'Little
'uns telled me so. Eh! but they're sharp 'uns, they are; I a'most think
they beat my own wenches for sharpness, though mappen it's wrong to say
so, and one on 'em in her grave. There's summut in th' weather, I
reckon, as sets folk a-wandering. My measter, him at th' shop yonder, is
spinning about th' world somewhere.'

'Is that the reason you're so soon at home to-night?' asked Margaret
innocently.

'Thou know'st nought about it, that's all,' said he, contemptuously.
'I'm not one wi' two faces--one for my measter, and t'other for his
back. I counted a' th' clocks in the town striking afore I'd leave my
work. No! yon Thornton's good enough for to fight wi', but too good for
to be cheated. It were you as getten me the place, and I thank yo' for
it. Thornton's is not a bad mill, as times go. Stand down, lad, and say
yo'r pretty hymn to Miss Margaret. That's right; steady on thy legs, and
right arm out as straight as a shewer. One to stop, two to stay, three
mak' ready, and four away!'

The little fellow repeated a Methodist hymn, far above his comprehension
in point of language, but of which the swinging rhythm had caught his
ear, and which he repeated with all the developed cadence of a member of
parliament. When Margaret had duly applauded, Nicholas called for
another, and yet another, much to her surprise, as she found him thus
oddly and unconsciously led to take an interest in the sacred things
which he had formerly scouted.

It was past the usual tea-time when she reached home; but she had the
comfort of feeling that no one had been kept waiting for her; and of
thinking her own thoughts while she rested, instead of anxiously
watching another person to learn whether to be grave or gay. After tea
she resolved to examine a large packet of letters, and pick out those
that were to be destroyed.

Among them she came to four or five of Mr. Henry Lennox's, relating to
Frederick's affairs; and she carefully read them over again, with the
sole intention, when she began, to ascertain exactly on how fine a
chance the justification of her brother hung. But when she had finished
the last, and weighed the pros and cons, the little personal revelation
of character contained in them forced itself on her notice. It was
evident enough, from the stiffness of the wording, that Mr. Lennox had
never forgotten his relation to her in any interest he might feel in the
subject of the correspondence. They were clever letters; Margaret saw
that in a twinkling; but she missed out of them all hearty and genial
atmosphere. They were to be preserved, however, as valuable; so she laid
them carefully on one side. When this little piece of business was
ended, she fell into a reverie; and the thought of her absent father ran
strangely in Margaret's head this night. She almost blamed herself for
having felt her solitude (and consequently his absence) as a relief; but
these two days had set her up afresh, with new strength and brighter
hope. Plans which had lately appeared to her in the guise of tasks, now
appeared like pleasures. The morbid scales had fallen from her eyes, and
she saw her position and her work more truly. If only Mr. Thornton would
restore her the lost friendship,--nay, if he would only come from time
to time to cheer her father as in former days,--though she should never
see him, she felt as if the course of her future life, though not
brilliant in prospect, might lie clear and even before her. She sighed
as she rose up to go to bed. In spite of the 'One step's enough for
me,'--in spite of the one plain duty of devotion to her father,--there
lay at her heart an anxiety and a pang of sorrow.

And Mr. Hale thought of Margaret, that April evening, just as strangely
and as persistently as she was thinking of him. He had been fatigued by
going about among his old friends and old familiar places. He had had
exaggerated ideas of the change which his altered opinions might make in
his friends' reception of him; but although some of them might have felt
shocked or grieved or indignant at his falling off in the abstract, as
soon as they saw the face of the man whom they had once loved, they
forgot his opinions in himself; or only remembered them enough to give
an additional tender gravity to their manner. For Mr. Hale had not been
known to many; he had belonged to one of the smaller colleges, and had
always been shy and reserved; but those who in youth had cared to
penetrate to the delicacy of thought and feeling that lay below his
silence and indecision, took him to their hearts, with something of the
protecting kindness which they would have shown to a woman. And the
renewal of this kindliness, after the lapse of years, and an interval of
so much change, overpowered him more than any roughness or expression of
disapproval could have done.

'I'm afraid we've done too much,' said Mr. Bell. 'You're suffering now
from having lived so long in that Milton air.

'I am tired,' said Mr. Hale. 'But it is not Milton air. I'm fifty-five
years of age, and that little fact of itself accounts for any loss of
strength.'

'Nonsense! I'm upwards of sixty, and feel no loss of strength, either
bodily or mental. Don't let me hear you talking so. Fifty-five! why,
you're quite a young man.'

Mr. Hale shook his head. 'These last few years!' said he. But after a
minute's pause, he raised himself from his half recumbent position, in
one of Mr. Bell's luxurious easy-chairs, and said with a kind of
trembling earnestness:

'Bell! you're not to think, that if I could have foreseen all that would
come of my change of opinion, and my resignation of my living--no! not
even if I could have known how _she_ would have suffered,--that I would
undo it--the act of open acknowledgment that I no longer held the same
faith as the church in which I was a priest. As I think now, even if I
could have foreseen that cruellest martyrdom of suffering, through the
sufferings of one whom I loved, I would have done just the same as far
as that step of openly leaving the church went. I might have done
differently, and acted more wisely, in all that I subsequently did for
my family. But I don't think God endued me with over-much wisdom or
strength,' he added, falling back into his old position.

Mr. Bell blew his nose ostentatiously before answering. Then he said:

'He gave you strength to do what your conscience told you was right; and
I don't see that we need any higher or holier strength than that; or
wisdom either. I know I have not that much; and yet men set me down in
their fool's books as a wise man; an independent character;
strong-minded, and all that cant. The veriest idiot who obeys his own
simple law of right, if it be but in wiping his shoes on a door-mat, is
wiser and stronger than I. But what gulls men are!'

There was a pause. Mr. Hale spoke first, in continuation of his thought:

'About Margaret.'

'Well! about Margaret. What then?'

'If I die---- '

'Nonsense!'

'What will become of her--I often think? I suppose the Lennoxes will ask
her to live with them. I try to think they will. Her aunt Shaw loved her
well in her own quiet way; but she forgets to love the absent.'

'A very common fault. What sort of people are the Lennoxes?'

'He, handsome, fluent, and agreeable. Edith, a sweet little spoiled
beauty. Margaret loves her with all her heart, and Edith with as much of
her heart as she can spare.'

'Now, Hale; you know that girl of yours has got pretty nearly all my
heart. I told you that before. Of course, as your daughter, as my
god-daughter, I took great interest in her before I saw her the last
time. But this visit that I paid to you at Milton made me her slave. I
went, a willing old victim, following the car of the conqueror. For,
indeed, she looks as grand and serene as one who has struggled, and may
be struggling, and yet has the victory secure in sight. Yes, in spite of
all her present anxieties, that was the look on her face. And so, all I
have is at her service, if she needs it; and will be hers, whether she
will or no, when I die. Moreover, I myself, will be her preux chevalier,
sixty and gouty though I be. Seriously, old friend, your daughter shall
be my principal charge in life, and all the help that either my wit or
my wisdom or my willing heart can give, shall be hers. I don't choose
her out as a subject for fretting. Something, I know of old, you must
have to worry yourself about, or you wouldn't be happy. But you're going
to outlive me by many a long year. You spare, thin men are always
tempting and always cheating Death! It's the stout, florid fellows like
me, that always go off first.'

If Mr. Bell had had a prophetic eye he might have seen the torch all but
inverted, and the angel with the grave and composed face standing very
nigh, beckoning to his friend. That night Mr. Hale laid his head down on
the pillow on which it never more should stir with life. The servant who
entered his room in the morning, received no answer to his speech; drew
near the bed, and saw the calm, beautiful face lying white and cold
under the ineffaceable seal of death. The attitude was exquisitely easy;
there had been no pain--no struggle. The action of the heart must have
ceased as he lay down.

Mr. Bell was stunned by the shock; and only recovered when the time came
for being angry at every suggestion of his man's.

'A coroner's inquest? Pooh. You don't think I poisoned him! Dr. Forbes
says it is just the natural end of a heart complaint. Poor old Hale! You
wore out that tender heart of yours before its time. Poor old friend!
how he talked of his---- Wallis, pack up a carpet-bag for me in five
minutes. Here have I been talking. Pack it up, I say. I must go to
Milton by the next train.'

The bag was packed, the cab ordered, the railway reached, in twenty
minutes from the moment of this decision. The London train whizzed by,
drew back some yards, and in Mr. Bell was hurried by the impatient
guard. He threw himself back in his seat, to try, with closed eyes, to
understand how one in life yesterday could be dead to-day; and shortly
tears stole out between his grizzled eye-lashes, at the feeling of which
he opened his keen eyes, and looked as severely cheerful as his set
determination could make him. He was not going to blubber before a set
of strangers. Not he!

There was no set of strangers, only one sitting far from him on the same
side. By and bye Mr. Bell peered at him, to discover what manner of man
it was that might have been observing his emotion; and behind the great
sheet of the outspread 'Times,' he recognised Mr. Thornton.

'Why, Thornton! is that you?' said he, removing hastily to a closer
proximity. He shook Mr. Thornton vehemently by the hand, until the gripe
ended in a sudden relaxation, for the hand was wanted to wipe away
tears. He had last seen Mr. Thornton in his friend Hale's company.

'I'm going to Milton, bound on a melancholy errand. Going to break to
Hale's daughter the news of his sudden death!'

'Death! Mr. Hale dead!'

'Ay; I keep saying it to myself, "Hale is dead!" but it doesn't make it
any the more real. Hale is dead for all that. He went to bed well, to
all appearance, last night, and was quite cold this morning when my
servant went to call him.'

'Where? I don't understand!'

'At Oxford. He came to stay with me; hadn't been in Oxford this
seventeen years--and this is the end of it.'

Not one word was spoken for above a quarter of an hour. Then Mr.
Thornton said:

'And she!' and stopped full short.

'Margaret you mean. Yes! I am going to tell her. Poor fellow! how full
his thoughts were of her all last night! Good God! Last night only. And
how immeasurably distant he is now! But I take Margaret as my child for
his sake. I said last night I would take her for her own sake. Well, I
take her for both.'

Mr. Thornton made one or two fruitless attempts to speak, before he
could get out the words:

'What will become of her!'

'I rather fancy there will be two people waiting for her: myself for
one. I would take a live dragon into my house to live, if, by hiring
such a chaperon, and setting up an establishment of my own, I could make
my old age happy with having Margaret for a daughter. But there are
those Lennoxes!'

'Who are they?' asked Mr. Thornton with trembling interest.

'Oh, smart London people, who very likely will think they've the best
right to her. Captain Lennox married her cousin--the girl she was
brought up with. Good enough people, I dare say. And there's her aunt,
Mrs. Shaw. There might be a way open, perhaps, by my offering to marry
that worthy lady! but that would be quite a pis aller. And then there's
that brother!'

'What brother? A brother of her aunt's?'

'No, no; a clever Lennox, (the captain's a fool, you must understand) a
young barrister, who will be setting his cap at Margaret. I know he has
had her in his mind this five years or more: one of his chums told me as
much; and he was only kept back by her want of fortune. Now that will be
done away with.'

'How?' asked Mr. Thornton, too earnestly curious to be aware of the
impertinence of his question.

'Why, she'll have my money at my death. And if this Henry Lennox is half
good enough for her, and she likes him--well! I might find another way
of getting a home through a marriage. I'm dreadfully afraid of being
tempted, at an unguarded moment, by the aunt.'

Neither Mr. Bell nor Mr. Thornton was in a laughing humour; so the
oddity of any of the speeches which the former made was unnoticed by
them. Mr. Bell whistled, without emitting any sound beyond a long
hissing breath; changed his seat, without finding comfort or rest while
Mr. Thornton sat immoveably still, his eyes fixed on one spot in the
newspaper, which he had taken up in order to give himself leisure to
think.

'Where have you been?' asked Mr. Bell, at length.

'To Havre. Trying to detect the secret of the great rise in the price of
cotton.'

'Ugh! Cotton, and speculations, and smoke, well-cleansed and
well-cared-for machinery, and unwashed and neglected hands. Poor old
Hale! Poor old Hale! If you could have known the change which it was to
him from Helstone. Do you know the New Forest at all?'

'Yes.' (Very shortly).

'Then you can fancy the difference between it and Milton. What part were
you in? Were you ever at Helstone? a little picturesque village, like
some in the Odenwald? You know Helstone?'

'I have seen it. It was a great change to leave it and come to Milton.'

He took up his newspaper with a determined air, as if resolved to avoid
further conversation; and Mr. Bell was fain to resort to his former
occupation of trying to find out how he could best break the news to
Margaret.

She was at an up-stairs window; she saw him alight; she guessed the
truth with an instinctive flash. She stood in the middle of the
drawing-room, as if arrested in her first impulse to rush downstairs,
and as if by the same restraining thought she had been turned to stone;
so white and immoveable was she.

'Oh! don't tell me! I know it from your face! You would have sent--you
would not have left him--if he were alive! Oh papa, papa!'




CHAPTER XLII

ALONE! ALONE!

    'When some beloved voice that was to you
     Both sound and sweetness, faileth suddenly,
     And silence, against which you dare not cry,
     Aches round you like a strong disease and new--
     What hope? what help? what music will undo
     That silence to your sense?'
             MRS. BROWNING.


The shock had been great. Margaret fell into a state of prostration,
which did not show itself in sobs and tears, or even find the relief of
words. She lay on the sofa, with her eyes shut, never speaking but when
spoken to, and then replying in whispers. Mr. Bell was perplexed. He
dared not leave her; he dared not ask her to accompany him back to
Oxford, which had been one of the plans he had formed on the journey to
Milton, her physical exhaustion was evidently too complete for her to
undertake any such fatigue--putting the sight that she would have to
encounter out of the question. Mr. Bell sate over the fire, considering
what he had better do. Margaret lay motionless, and almost breathless by
him. He would not leave her, even for the dinner which Dixon had
prepared for him down-stairs, and, with sobbing hospitality, would fain
have tempted him to eat. He had a plateful of something brought up to
him. In general, he was particular and dainty enough, and knew well each
shade of flavour in his food, but now the devilled chicken tasted like
sawdust. He minced up some of the fowl for Margaret, and peppered and
salted it well; but when Dixon, following his directions, tried to feed
her, the languid shake of head proved that in such a state as Margaret
was in, food would only choke, not nourish her.

Mr. Bell gave a great sigh; lifted up his stout old limbs (stiff with
travelling) from their easy position, and followed Dixon out of the
room.

'I can't leave her. I must write to them at Oxford, to see that the
preparations are made: they can be getting on with these till I arrive.
Can't Mrs. Lennox come to her? I'll write and tell her she must. The
girl must have some woman-friend about her, if only to talk her into a
good fit of crying.'

Dixon was crying--enough for two; but, after wiping her eyes and
steadying her voice, she managed to tell Mr. Bell, that Mrs. Lennox was
too near her confinement to be able to undertake any journey at present.

'Well! I suppose we must have Mrs. Shaw; she's come back to England,
isn't she?'

'Yes, sir, she's come back; but I don't think she will like to leave
Mrs. Lennox at such an interesting time,' said Dixon, who did not much
approve of a stranger entering the household, to share with her in her
ruling care of Margaret.

'Interesting time be--' Mr. Bell restricted himself to coughing over the
end of his sentence. 'She could be content to be at Venice or Naples, or
some of those Popish places, at the last "interesting time," which took
place in Corfu, I think. And what does that little prosperous woman's
"interesting time" signify, in comparison with that poor creature
there,--that helpless, homeless, friendless Margaret--lying as still on
that sofa as if it were an altar-tomb, and she the stone statue on it. I
tell you, Mrs. Shaw shall come. See that a room, or whatever she wants,
is got ready for her by to-morrow night. I'll take care she comes.'

Accordingly Mr. Bell wrote a letter, which Mrs. Shaw declared, with many
tears, to be so like one of the dear general's when he was going to have
a fit of the gout, that she should always value and preserve it. If he
had given her the option, by requesting or urging her, as if a refusal
were possible, she might not have come--true and sincere as was her
sympathy with Margaret. It needed the sharp uncourteous command to make
her conquer her vis inertiae, and allow herself to be packed by her
maid, after the latter had completed the boxes. Edith, all cap, shawls,
and tears, came out to the top of the stairs, as Captain Lennox was
taking her mother down to the carriage:

'Don't forget, mamma; Margaret must come and live with us. Sholto will
go to Oxford on Wednesday, and you must send word by Mr. Bell to him
when we're to expect you. And if you want Sholto, he can go on from
Oxford to Milton. Don't forget, mamma; you are to bring back Margaret.'

Edith re-entered the drawing-room. Mr. Henry Lennox was there, cutting
open the pages of a new Review. Without lifting his head, he said, 'If
you don't like Sholto to be so long absent from you, Edith, I hope you
will let me go down to Milton, and give what assistance I can.'

'Oh, thank you,' said Edith, 'I dare say old Mr. Bell will do everything
he can, and more help may not be needed. Only one does not look for much
savoir-faire from a resident Fellow. Dear, darling Margaret! won't it be
nice to have her here, again? You were both great allies, years ago.'

'Were we?' asked he indifferently, with an appearance of being
interested in a passage in the Review.

'Well, perhaps not--I forget. I was so full of Sholto. But doesn't it
fall out well, that if my uncle was to die, it should be just now, when
we are come home, and settled in the old house, and quite ready to
receive Margaret? Poor thing! what a change it will be to her from
Milton! I'll have new chintz for her bedroom, and make it look new and
bright, and cheer her up a little.'

In the same spirit of kindness, Mrs. Shaw journeyed to Milton,
occasionally dreading the first meeting, and wondering how it would be
got over; but more frequently planning how soon she could get Margaret
away from 'that horrid place,' and back into the pleasant comforts of
Harley Street.

'Oh dear!' she said to her maid; 'look at those chimneys! My poor sister
Hale! I don't think I could have rested at Naples, if I had known what
it was! I must have come and fetched her and Margaret away.' And to
herself she acknowledged, that she had always thought her brother-in-law
rather a weak man, but never so weak as now, when she saw for what a
place he had exchanged the lovely Helstone home.

Margaret had remained in the same state; white, motionless, speechless,
tearless. They had told her that her aunt Shaw was coming; but she had
not expressed either surprise or pleasure, or dislike to the idea. Mr.
Bell, whose appetite had returned, and who appreciated Dixon's
endeavours to gratify it, in vain urged upon her to taste some
sweetbreads stewed with oysters; she shook her head with the same quiet
obstinacy as on the previous day; and he was obliged to console himself
for her rejection, by eating them all himself. But Margaret was the
first to hear the stopping of the cab that brought her aunt from the
railway station. Her eyelids quivered, her lips coloured and trembled.
Mr. Bell went down to meet Mrs. Shaw; and when they came up, Margaret
was standing, trying to steady her dizzy self; and when she saw her
aunt, she went forward to the arms open to receive her, and first found
the passionate relief of tears on her aunt's shoulder. All thoughts of
quiet habitual love, of tenderness for years, of relationship to the
dead,--all that inexplicable likeness in look, tone, and gesture, that
seem to belong to one family, and which reminded Margaret so forcibly at
this moment of her mother,--came in to melt and soften her numbed heart
into the overflow of warm tears.

Mr. Bell stole out of the room, and went down into the study, where he
ordered a fire, and tried to divert his thoughts by taking down and
examining the different books. Each volume brought a remembrance or a
suggestion of his dead friend. It might be a change of employment from
his two days' work of watching Margaret, but it was no change of
thought. He was glad to catch the sound of Mr. Thornton's voice, making
enquiry at the door. Dixon was rather cavalierly dismissing him; for
with the appearance of Mrs. Shaw's maid, came visions of former
grandeur, of the Beresford blood, of the 'station' (so she was pleased
to term it) from which her young lady had been ousted, and to which she
was now, please God, to be restored. These visions, which she had been
dwelling on with complacency in her conversation with Mrs. Shaw's maid
(skilfully eliciting meanwhile all the circumstances of state and
consequence connected with the Harley Street establishment, for the
edification of the listening Martha), made Dixon rather inclined to be
supercilious in her treatment of any inhabitant of Milton; so, though
she always stood rather in awe of Mr. Thornton, she was as curt as she
durst be in telling him that he could see none of the inmates of the
house that night. It was rather uncomfortable to be contradicted in her
statement by Mr. Bell's opening the study-door, and calling out:

'Thornton! is that you? Come in for a minute or two; I want to speak to
you.' So Mr. Thornton went into the study, and Dixon had to retreat into
the kitchen, and reinstate herself in her own esteem by a prodigious
story of Sir John Beresford's coach and six, when he was high sheriff.

'I don't know what I wanted to say to you after all. Only it's dull
enough to sit in a room where everything speaks to you of a dead friend.
Yet Margaret and her aunt must have the drawing-room to themselves!'

'Is Mrs.--is her aunt come?' asked Mr. Thornton.

'Come? Yes! maid and all. One would have thought she might have come by
herself at such a time! And now I shall have to turn out and find my way
to the Clarendon.'

'You must not go to the Clarendon. We have five or six empty bed-rooms
at home.'

'Well aired?'

'I think you may trust my mother for that.'

'Then I'll only run up-stairs and wish that wan girl good-night, and
make my bow to her aunt, and go off with you straight.'

Mr. Bell was some time up-stairs. Mr. Thornton began to think it long,
for he was full of business, and had hardly been able to spare the time
for running up to Crampton, and enquiring how Miss Hale was.

When they had set out upon their walk, Mr. Bell said:

'I was kept by those women in the drawing-room. Mrs. Shaw is anxious to
get home--on account of her daughter, she says--and wants Margaret to go
off with her at once. Now she is no more fit for travelling than I am
for flying. Besides, she says, and very justly, that she has friends she
must see--that she must wish good-bye to several people; and then her
aunt worried her about old claims, and was she forgetful of old friends?
And she said, with a great burst of crying, she should be glad enough to
go from a place where she had suffered so much. Now I must return to
Oxford to-morrow, and I don't know on which side of the scale to throw
in my voice.'

He paused, as if asking a question; but he received no answer from his
companion, the echo of whose thoughts kept repeating--

'Where she had suffered so much.' Alas! and that was the way in which
this eighteen months in Milton--to him so unspeakably precious, down to
its very bitterness, which was worth all the rest of life's
sweetness--would be remembered. Neither loss of father, nor loss of
mother, dear as she was to Mr. Thornton, could have poisoned the
remembrance of the weeks, the days, the hours, when a walk of two miles,
every step of which was pleasant, as it brought him nearer and nearer to
her, took him to her sweet presence--every step of which was rich, as
each recurring moment that bore him away from her made him recall some
fresh grace in her demeanour, or pleasant pungency in her character.
Yes! whatever had happened to him, external to his relation to her, he
could never have spoken of that time, when he could have seen her every
day--when he had her within his grasp, as it were--as a time of
suffering. It had been a royal time of luxury to him, with all its
stings and contumelies, compared to the poverty that crept round and
clipped the anticipation of the future down to sordid fact, and life
without an atmosphere of either hope or fear.

Mrs. Thornton and Fanny were in the dining-room; the latter in a flutter
of small exultation, as the maid held up one glossy material after
another, to try the effect of the wedding-dresses by candlelight. Her
mother really tried to sympathise with her, but could not. Neither taste
nor dress were in her line of subjects, and she heartily wished that
Fanny had accepted her brother's offer of having the wedding clothes
provided by some first-rate London dressmaker, without the endless
troublesome discussions, and unsettled wavering, that arose out of
Fanny's desire to choose and superintend everything herself. Mr.
Thornton was only too glad to mark his grateful approbation of any
sensible man, who could be captivated by Fanny's second-rate airs and
graces, by giving her ample means for providing herself with the finery,
which certainly rivalled, if it did not exceed, the lover in her
estimation. When her brother and Mr. Bell came in, Fanny blushed and
simpered, and fluttered over the signs of her employment, in a way which
could not have failed to draw attention from any one else but Mr. Bell.
If he thought about her and her silks and satins at all, it was to
compare her and them with the pale sorrow he had left behind him,
sitting motionless, with bent head and folded hands, in a room where the
stillness was so great that you might almost fancy the rush in your
straining ears was occasioned by the spirits of the dead, yet hovering
round their beloved. For, when Mr. Bell had first gone up-stairs, Mrs.
Shaw lay asleep on the sofa; and no sound broke the silence.

Mrs. Thornton gave Mr. Bell her formal, hospitable welcome. She was
never so gracious as when receiving her son's friends in her son's
house; and the more unexpected they were, the more honour to her
admirable housekeeping preparations for comfort.

'How is Miss Hale?' she asked.

'About as broken down by this last stroke as she can be.'

'I am sure it is very well for her that she has such a friend as you.'

'I wish I were her only friend, madam. I daresay it sounds very brutal;
but here have I been displaced, and turned out of my post of comforter
and adviser by a fine lady aunt; and there are cousins and what not
claiming her in London, as if she were a lap-dog belonging to them. And
she is too weak and miserable to have a will of her own.'

'She must indeed be weak,' said Mrs. Thornton, with an implied meaning
which her son understood well. 'But where,' continued Mrs. Thornton,
'have these relations been all this time that Miss Hale has appeared
almost friendless, and has certainly had a good deal of anxiety to
bear?' But she did not feel interest enough in the answer to her
question to wait for it. She left the room to make her household
arrangements.

'They have been living abroad. They have some kind of claim upon her. I
will do them that justice. The aunt brought her up, and she and the
cousin have been like sisters. The thing vexing me, you see, is that I
wanted to take her for a child of my own; and I am jealous of these
people, who don't seem to value the privilege of their right. Now it
would be different if Frederick claimed her.'

'Frederick!' exclaimed Mr. Thornton. 'Who is he? What right--?' He
stopped short in his vehement question.

'Frederick,' said Mr. Bell in surprise. 'Why don't you know? He's her
brother. Have you not heard--'

'I never heard his name before. Where is he? Who is he?'

'Surely I told you about him, when the family first came to Milton--the
son who was concerned in that mutiny.'

'I never heard of him till this moment. Where does he live?'

'In Spain. He's liable to be arrested the moment he sets foot on English
ground. Poor fellow! he will grieve at not being able to attend his
father's funeral. We must be content with Captain Lennox; for I don't
know of any other relation to summon.'

'I hope I may be allowed to go?'

'Certainly; thankfully. You're a good fellow, after all, Thornton. Hale
liked you. He spoke to me, only the other day, about you at Oxford. He
regretted he had seen so little of you lately. I am obliged to you for
wishing to show him respect.'

'But about Frederick. Does he never come to England?'

'Never.'

'He was not over here about the time of Mrs. Hale's death?'

'No. Why, I was here then. I hadn't seen Hale for years and years and,
if you remember, I came--No, it was some time after that that I came.
But poor Frederick Hale was not here then. What made you think he was?'

'I saw a young man walking with Miss Hale one day,' replied Mr.
Thornton, 'and I think it was about that time.'

'Oh, that would be this young Lennox, the Captain's brother. He's a
lawyer, and they were in pretty constant correspondence with him; and I
remember Mr. Hale told me he thought he would come down. Do you know,'
said Mr. Bell, wheeling round, and shutting one eye, the better to bring
the forces of the other to bear with keen scrutiny on Mr. Thornton's
face, 'that I once fancied you had a little tenderness for Margaret?'

No answer. No change of countenance.

'And so did poor Hale. Not at first, and not till I had put it into his
head.'

'I admired Miss Hale. Every one must do so. She is a beautiful
creature,' said Mr. Thornton, driven to bay by Mr. Bell's pertinacious
questioning.

'Is that all! You can speak of her in that measured way, as simply a
"beautiful creature"--only something to catch the eye. I did hope you
had had nobleness enough in you to make you pay her the homage of the
heart. Though I believe--in fact I know, she would have rejected you,
still to have loved her without return would have lifted you higher than
all those, be they who they may, that have never known her to love.
"Beautiful creature" indeed! Do you speak of her as you would of a horse
or a dog?'

Mr. Thornton's eyes glowed like red embers.

'Mr. Bell,' said he, 'before you speak so, you should remember that all
men are not as free to express what they feel as you are. Let us talk of
something else.' For though his heart leaped up, as at a trumpet-call,
to every word that Mr. Bell had said, and though he knew that what he
had said would henceforward bind the thought of the old Oxford Fellow
closely up with the most precious things of his heart, yet he would not
be forced into any expression of what he felt towards Margaret. He was
no mocking-bird of praise, to try because another extolled what he
reverenced and passionately loved, to outdo him in laudation. So he
turned to some of the dry matters of business that lay between Mr. Bell
and him, as landlord and tenant.

'What is that heap of brick and mortar we came against in the yard? Any
repairs wanted?'

'No, none, thank you.'

'Are you building on your own account? If you are, I'm very much obliged
to you.'

'I'm building a dining-room--for the men I mean--the hands.'

'I thought you were hard to please, if this room wasn't good enough to
satisfy you, a bachelor.'

'I've got acquainted with a strange kind of chap, and I put one or two
children in whom he is interested to school. So, as I happened to be
passing near his house one day, I just went there about some trifling
payment to be made; and I saw such a miserable black frizzle of a
dinner--a greasy cinder of meat, as first set me a-thinking. But it was
not till provisions grew so high this winter that I bethought me how, by
buying things wholesale, and cooking a good quantity of provisions
together, much money might be saved, and much comfort gained. So I spoke
to my friend--or my enemy--the man I told you of--and he found fault
with every detail of my plan; and in consequence I laid it aside, both
as impracticable, and also because if I forced it into operation I
should be interfering with the independence of my men; when, suddenly,
this Higgins came to me and graciously signified his approval of a
scheme so nearly the same as mine, that I might fairly have claimed it;
and, moreover, the approval of several of his fellow-workmen, to whom he
had spoken. I was a little "riled," I confess, by his manner, and
thought of throwing the whole thing overboard to sink or swim. But it
seemed childish to relinquish a plan which I had once thought wise and
well-laid, just because I myself did not receive all the honour and
consequence due to the originator. So I coolly took the part assigned to
me, which is something like that of steward to a club. I buy in the
provisions wholesale, and provide a fitting matron or cook.'

'I hope you give satisfaction in your new capacity. Are you a good judge
of potatoes and onions? But I suppose Mrs. Thornton assists you in your
marketing.'

'Not a bit,' replied Mr. Thornton. 'She disapproves of the whole plan,
and now we never mention it to each other. But I manage pretty well,
getting in great stocks from Liverpool, and being served in butcher's
meat by our own family butcher. I can assure you, the hot dinners the
matron turns out are by no means to be despised.'

'Do you taste each dish as it goes in, in virtue of your office? I hope
you have a white wand.'

'I was very scrupulous, at first, in confining myself to the mere
purchasing part, and even in that I rather obeyed the men's orders
conveyed through the housekeeper, than went by my own judgment. At one
time, the beef was too large, at another the mutton was not fat enough.
I think they saw how careful I was to leave them free, and not to
intrude my own ideas upon them; so, one day, two or three of the men--my
friend Higgins among them--asked me if I would not come in and take a
snack. It was a very busy day, but I saw that the men would be hurt if,
after making the advance, I didn't meet them half-way, so I went in, and
I never made a better dinner in my life. I told them (my next neighbours
I mean, for I'm no speech-maker) how much I'd enjoyed it; and for some
time, whenever that especial dinner recurred in their dietary, I was
sure to be met by these men, with a "Master, there's hot-pot for dinner
to-day, win yo' come?" If they had not asked me, I would no more have
intruded on them than I'd have gone to the mess at the barracks without
invitation.'

'I should think you were rather a restraint on your hosts' conversation.
They can't abuse the masters while you're there. I suspect they take it
out on non-hot-pot days.'

'Well! hitherto we've steered clear of all vexed questions. But if any
of the old disputes came up again, I would certainly speak out my mind
next hot-pot day. But you are hardly acquainted with our Darkshire
fellows, for all you're a Darkshire man yourself. They have such a sense
of humour, and such a racy mode of expression! I am getting really to
know some of them now, and they talk pretty freely before me.'

'Nothing like the act of eating for equalising men. Dying is nothing to
it. The philosopher dies sententiously--the pharisee ostentatiously--the
simple-hearted humbly--the poor idiot blindly, as the sparrow falls to
the ground; the philosopher and idiot, publican and pharisee, all eat
after the same fashion--given an equally good digestion. There's theory
for theory for you!'

'Indeed I have no theory; I hate theories.'

'I beg your pardon. To show my penitence, will you accept a ten pound
note towards your marketing, and give the poor fellows a feast?'

'Thank you; but I'd rather not. They pay me rent for the oven and
cooking-places at the back of the mill: and will have to pay more for
the new dining-room. I don't want it to fall into a charity. I don't
want donations. Once let in the principle, and I should have people
going, and talking, and spoiling the simplicity of the whole thing.'

'People will talk about any new plan. You can't help that.'

'My enemies, if I have any, may make a philanthropic fuss about this
dinner-scheme; but you are a friend, and I expect you will pay my
experiment the respect of silence. It is but a new broom at present, and
sweeps clean enough. But by-and-by we shall meet with plenty of
stumbling-blocks, no doubt.'




CHAPTER XLIII

MARGARET'S FLITTIN'

    'The meanest thing to which we bid adieu,
     Loses its meanness in the parting hour.'
              ELLIOTT.


Mrs. Shaw took as vehement a dislike as it was possible for one of her
gentle nature to do, against Milton. It was noisy, and smoky, and the
poor people whom she saw in the streets were dirty, and the rich ladies
over-dressed, and not a man that she saw, high or low, had his clothes
made to fit him. She was sure Margaret would never regain her lost
strength while she stayed in Milton; and she herself was afraid of one
of her old attacks of the nerves. Margaret must return with her, and
that quickly. This, if not the exact force of her words, was at any rate
the spirit of what she urged on Margaret, till the latter, weak, weary,
and broken-spirited, yielded a reluctant promise that, as soon as
Wednesday was over she would prepare to accompany her aunt back to town,
leaving Dixon in charge of all the arrangements for paying bills,
disposing of furniture, and shutting up the house. Before that
Wednesday--that mournful Wednesday, when Mr. Hale was to be interred,
far away from either of the homes he had known in life, and far away
from the wife who lay lonely among strangers (and this last was
Margaret's great trouble, for she thought that if she had not given way
to that overwhelming stupor during the first sad days, she could have
arranged things otherwise)--before that Wednesday, Margaret received a
letter from Mr. Bell.

'MY DEAR MARGARET:--I did mean to have returned to Milton on Thursday,
but unluckily it turns out to be one of the rare occasions when we,
Plymouth Fellows, are called upon to perform any kind of duty, and I
must not be absent from my post. Captain Lennox and Mr. Thornton are
here. The former seems a smart, well-meaning man; and has proposed to go
over to Milton, and assist you in any search for the will; of course
there is none, or you would have found it by this time, if you followed
my directions. Then the Captain declares he must take you and his
mother-in-law home; and, in his wife's present state, I don't see how
you can expect him to remain away longer than Friday. However, that
Dixon of yours is trusty; and can hold her, or your own, till I come. I
will put matters into the hands of my Milton attorney if there is no
will; for I doubt this smart captain is no great man of business.
Nevertheless, his moustachios are splendid. There will have to be a
sale, so select what things you wish reserved. Or you can send a list
afterwards. Now two things more, and I have done. You know, or if you
don't, your poor father did, that you are to have my money and goods
when I die. Not that I mean to die yet; but I name this just to explain
what is coming. These Lennoxes seem very fond of you now; and perhaps
may continue to be; perhaps not. So it is best to start with a formal
agreement; namely, that you are to pay them two hundred and fifty pounds
a year, as long as you and they find it pleasant to live together.
(This, of course, includes Dixon; mind you don't be cajoled into paying
any more for her.) Then you won't be thrown adrift, if some day the
captain wishes to have his house to himself, but you can carry yourself
and your two hundred and fifty pounds off somewhere else; if, indeed, I
have not claimed you to come and keep house for me first. Then as to
dress, and Dixon, and personal expenses, and confectionery (all young
ladies eat confectionery till wisdom comes by age), I shall consult some
lady of my acquaintance, and see how much you will have from your father
before fixing this. Now, Margaret, have you flown out before you have
read this far, and wondered what right the old man has to settle your
affairs for you so cavalierly? I make no doubt you have. Yet the old man
has a right. He has loved your father for five and thirty years; he
stood beside him on his wedding-day; he closed his eyes in death.
Moreover, he is your godfather; and as he cannot do you much good
spiritually, having a hidden consciousness of your superiority in such
things, he would fain do you the poor good of endowing you materially.
And the old man has not a known relation on earth; "who is there to
mourn for Adam Bell?" and his whole heart is set and bent upon this one
thing, and Margaret Hale is not the girl to say him nay. Write by
return, if only two lines, to tell me your answer. But _no thanks_.'

Margaret took up a pen and scrawled with trembling hand, 'Margaret Hale
is not the girl to say him nay.' In her weak state she could not think
of any other words, and yet she was vexed to use these. But she was so
much fatigued even by this slight exertion, that if she could have
thought of another form of acceptance, she could not have sate up to
write a syllable of it. She was obliged to lie down again, and try not
to think.

'My dearest child! Has that letter vexed or troubled you?'

'No!' said Margaret feebly. 'I shall be better when to-morrow is over.'

'I feel sure, darling, you won't be better till I get you out of this
horrid air. How you can have borne it this two years I can't imagine.'

'Where could I go to? I could not leave papa and mamma.'

'Well! don't distress yourself, my dear. I dare say it was all for the
best, only I had no conception of how you were living. Our butler's wife
lives in a better house than this.'

'It is sometimes very pretty--in summer; you can't judge by what it is
now. I have been very happy here,' and Margaret closed her eyes by way
of stopping the conversation.

The house teemed with comfort now, compared to what it had done. The
evenings were chilly, and by Mrs. Shaw's directions fires were lighted
in every bedroom. She petted Margaret in every possible way, and bought
every delicacy, or soft luxury in which she herself would have burrowed
and sought comfort. But Margaret was indifferent to all these things;
or, if they forced themselves upon her attention, it was simply as
causes for gratitude to her aunt, who was putting herself so much out of
her way to think of her. She was restless, though so weak. All the day
long, she kept herself from thinking of the ceremony which was going on
at Oxford, by wandering from room to room, and languidly setting aside
such articles as she wished to retain. Dixon followed her by Mrs. Shaw's
desire, ostensibly to receive instructions, but with a private
injunction to soothe her into repose as soon as might be.

'These books, Dixon, I will keep. All the rest will you send to Mr.
Bell? They are of a kind that he will value for themselves, as well as
for papa's sake. This---- I should like you to take this to Mr.
Thornton, after I am gone. Stay; I will write a note with it.' And she
sate down hastily, as if afraid of thinking, and wrote:

     'DEAR SIR,--The accompanying book I am sure will be valued by you
     for the sake of my father, to whom it belonged.

     'Yours sincerely,

     'MARGARET HALE.'

She set out again upon her travels through the house, turning over
articles, known to her from her childhood, with a sort of caressing
reluctance to leave them--old-fashioned, worn and shabby, as they might
be. But she hardly spoke again; and Dixon's report to Mrs. Shaw was,
that 'she doubted whether Miss Hale heard a word of what she said,
though she talked the whole time, in order to divert her attention.' The
consequence of being on her feet all day was excessive bodily weariness
in the evening, and a better night's rest than she had had since she had
heard of Mr. Hale's death.

At breakfast time the next day, she expressed her wish to go and bid one
or two friends good-bye. Mrs. Shaw objected:

'I am sure, my dear, you can have no friends here with whom you are
sufficiently intimate to justify you in calling upon them so soon;
before you have been at church.'

'But to-day is my only day; if Captain Lennox comes this afternoon, and
if we must--if I must really go to-morrow---- '

'Oh, yes; we shall go to-morrow. I am more and more convinced that this
air is bad for you, and makes you look so pale and ill; besides, Edith
expects us; and she may be waiting me; and you cannot be left alone, my
dear, at your age. No; if you must pay these calls, I will go with you.
Dixon can get us a coach, I suppose?'

So Mrs. Shaw went to take care of Margaret, and took her maid with her
to take care of the shawls and air-cushions. Margaret's face was too sad
to lighten up into a smile at all this preparation for paying two
visits, that she had often made by herself at all hours of the day. She
was half afraid of owning that one place to which she was going was
Nicholas Higgins'; all she could do was to hope her aunt would be
indisposed to get out of the coach, and walk up the court, and at every
breath of wind have her face slapped by wet clothes, hanging out to dry
on ropes stretched from house to house.

There was a little battle in Mrs. Shaw's mind between ease and a sense
of matronly propriety; but the former gained the day; and with many an
injunction to Margaret to be careful of herself, and not to catch any
fever, such as was always lurking in such places, her aunt permitted her
to go where she had often been before without taking any precaution or
requiring any permission.

Nicholas was out; only Mary and one or two of the Boucher children at
home. Margaret was vexed with herself for not having timed her visit
better. Mary had a very blunt intellect, although her feelings were warm
and kind; and the instant she understood what Margaret's purpose was in
coming to see them, she began to cry and sob with so little restraint
that Margaret found it useless to say any of the thousand little things
which had suggested themselves to her as she was coming along in the
coach. She could only try to comfort her a little by suggesting the
vague chance of their meeting again, at some possible time, in some
possible place, and bid her tell her father how much she wished, if he
could manage it, that he should come to see her when he had done his
work in the evening.

As she was leaving the place, she stopped and looked round; then
hesitated a little before she said:

'I should like to have some little thing to remind me of Bessy.'

Instantly Mary's generosity was keenly alive. What could they give? And
on Margaret's singling out a little common drinking-cup, which she
remembered as the one always standing by Bessy's side with drink for her
feverish lips, Mary said:

'Oh, take summut better; that only cost fourpence!'

'That will do, thank you,' said Margaret; and she went quickly away,
while the light caused by the pleasure of having something to give yet
lingered on Mary's face.

'Now to Mrs. Thornton's,' thought she to herself. 'It must be done.' But
she looked rather rigid and pale at the thought of it, and had hard work
to find the exact words in which to explain to her aunt who Mrs.
Thornton was, and why she should go to bid her farewell.

They (for Mrs. Shaw alighted here) were shown into the drawing-room, in
which a fire had only just been kindled. Mrs. Shaw huddled herself up in
her shawl, and shivered.

'What an icy room!' she said.

They had to wait for some time before Mrs. Thornton entered. There was
some softening in her heart towards Margaret, now that she was going
away out of her sight. She remembered her spirit, as shown at various
times and places even more than the patience with which she had endured
long and wearing cares. Her countenance was blander than usual, as she
greeted her; there was even a shade of tenderness in her manner, as she
noticed the white, tear-swollen face, and the quiver in the voice which
Margaret tried to make so steady.

'Allow me to introduce my aunt, Mrs. Shaw. I am going away from Milton
to-morrow; I do not know if you are aware of it; but I wanted to see you
once again, Mrs. Thornton, to--to apologise for my manner the last time
I saw you; and to say that I am sure you meant kindly--however much we
may have misunderstood each other.'

Mrs. Shaw looked extremely perplexed by what Margaret had said. Thanks
for kindness! and apologies for failure in good manners! But Mrs.
Thornton replied:

'Miss Hale, I am glad you do me justice. I did no more than I believed
to be my duty in remonstrating with you as I did. I have always desired
to act the part of a friend to you. I am glad you do me justice.'

'And,' said Margaret, blushing excessively as she spoke, 'will you do me
justice, and believe that though I cannot--I do not choose--to give
explanations of my conduct, I have not acted in the unbecoming way you
apprehended?'

Margaret's voice was so soft, and her eyes so pleading, that Mrs.
Thornton was for once affected by the charm of manner to which she had
hitherto proved herself invulnerable.

'Yes, I do believe you. Let us say no more about it. Where are you going
to reside, Miss Hale? I understood from Mr. Bell that you were going to
leave Milton. You never liked Milton, you know,' said Mrs. Thornton,
with a sort of grim smile; 'but for all that, you must not expect me to
congratulate you on quitting it. Where shall you live?'

'With my aunt,' replied Margaret, turning towards Mrs. Shaw.

'My niece will reside with me in Harley Street. She is almost like a
daughter to me,' said Mrs. Shaw, looking fondly at Margaret; 'and I am
glad to acknowledge my own obligation for any kindness that has been
shown to her. If you and your husband ever come to town, my son and
daughter, Captain and Mrs. Lennox, will, I am sure, join with me in
wishing to do anything in our power to show you attention.'

Mrs. Thornton thought in her own mind, that Margaret had not taken much
care to enlighten her aunt as to the relationship between the Mr. and
Mrs. Thornton, towards whom the fine-lady aunt was extending her soft
patronage; so she answered shortly,

'My husband is dead. Mr. Thornton is my son. I never go to London; so I
am not likely to be able to avail myself of your polite offers.'

At this instant Mr. Thornton entered the room; he had only just returned
from Oxford. His mourning suit spoke of the reason that had called him
there.

'John,' said his mother, 'this lady is Mrs. Shaw, Miss Hale's aunt. I am
sorry to say, that Miss Hale's call is to wish us good-bye.'

'You are going then!' said he, in a low voice.

'Yes,' said Margaret. 'We leave to-morrow.'

'My son-in-law comes this evening to escort us,' said Mrs. Shaw.

Mr. Thornton turned away. He had not sat down, and now he seemed to be
examining something on the table, almost as if he had discovered an
unopened letter, which had made him forget the present company. He did
not even seem to be aware when they got up to take leave. He started
forwards, however, to hand Mrs. Shaw down to the carriage. As it drove
up, he and Margaret stood close together on the door-step, and it was
impossible but that the recollection of the day of the riot should force
itself into both their minds. Into his it came associated with the
speeches of the following day; her passionate declaration that there was
not a man in all that violent and desperate crowd, for whom she did not
care as much as for him. And at the remembrance of her taunting words,
his brow grew stern, though his heart beat thick with longing love.
'No!' said he, 'I put it to the touch once, and I lost it all. Let her
go,--with her stony heart, and her beauty;--how set and terrible her
look is now, for all her loveliness of feature! She is afraid I shall
speak what will require some stern repression. Let her go. Beauty and
heiress as she may be, she will find it hard to meet with a truer heart
than mine. Let her go!'

And there was no tone of regret, or emotion of any kind in the voice
with which he said good-bye; and the offered hand was taken with a
resolute calmness, and dropped as carelessly as if it had been a dead
and withered flower. But none in his household saw Mr. Thornton again
that day. He was busily engaged; or so he said.

Margaret's strength was so utterly exhausted by these visits, that she
had to submit to much watching, and petting, and sighing
'I-told-you-so's,' from her aunt. Dixon said she was quite as bad as she
had been on the first day she heard of her father's death; and she and
Mrs. Shaw consulted as to the desirableness of delaying the morrow's
journey. But when her aunt reluctantly proposed a few days' delay to
Margaret, the latter writhed her body as if in acute suffering, and
said:

'Oh! let us go. I cannot be patient here. I shall not get well here. I
want to forget.'

So the arrangements went on; and Captain Lennox came, and with him news
of Edith and the little boy; and Margaret found that the indifferent,
careless conversation of one who, however kind, was not too warm and
anxious a sympathiser, did her good. She roused up; and by the time that
she knew she might expect Higgins, she was able to leave the room
quietly, and await in her own chamber the expected summons.

'Eh!' said he, as she came in, 'to think of th' oud gentleman dropping
off as he did! Yo' might ha' knocked me down wi' a straw when they
telled me. "Mr. Hale?" said I; "him as was th' parson?" "Ay," said they.
"Then," said I, "there's as good a man gone as ever lived on this earth,
let who will be t' other!" And I came to see yo', and tell yo' how
grieved I were, but them women in th' kitchen wouldn't tell yo' I were
there. They said yo' were ill,--and butter me, but yo' dunnot look like
th' same wench. And yo're going to be a grand lady up i' Lunnon, aren't
yo'?'

'Not a grand lady,' said Margaret, half smiling.

'Well! Thornton said--says he, a day or two ago, "Higgins, have yo' seen
Miss Hale?" "No," says I; "there's a pack o' women who won't let me at
her. But I can bide my time, if she's ill. She and I knows each other
pretty well; and hoo'l not go doubting that I'm main sorry for th' oud
gentleman's death, just because I can't get at her and tell her so." And
says he, "Yo'll not have much time for to try and see her, my fine chap.
She's not for staying with us a day longer nor she can help. She's got
grand relations, and they're carrying her off; and we sha'n't see her no
more." "Measter," said I, "if I dunnot see her afore hoo goes, I'll
strive to get up to Lunnun next Whissuntide, that I will. I'll not be
baulked of saying her good-bye by any relations whatsomdever." But,
bless yo', I knowed yo'd come. It were only for to humour the measter, I
let on as if I thought yo'd mappen leave Milton without seeing me.'

'You're quite right,' said Margaret. 'You only do me justice. And you'll
not forget me, I'm sure. If no one else in Milton remembers me, I'm
certain you will; and papa too. You know how good and how tender he was.
Look, Higgins! here is his bible. I have kept it for you. I can ill
spare it; but I know he would have liked you to have it. I'm sure you'll
care for it, and study what is in it, for his sake.'

'Yo' may say that. If it were the deuce's own scribble, and yo' axed me
to read in it for yo'r sake, and th' oud gentleman's, I'd do it.
Whatten's this, wench? I'm not going for to take yo'r brass, so dunnot
think it. We've been great friends, 'bout the sound o' money passing
between us.'

'For the children--for Boucher's children,' said Margaret, hurriedly.
'They may need it. You've no right to refuse it for them. I would not
give you a penny,' she said, smiling; 'don't think there's any of it for
you.'

'Well, wench! I can nobbut say, Bless yo'! and bless yo'!--and amen.'




CHAPTER XLIV

EASE NOT PEACE

    'A dull rotation, never at a stay,
     Yesterday's face twin image of to-day.'
              COWPER.

     And till he reach to that, his joy can ne'er be full.'

It was very well for Margaret that the extreme quiet of the Harley
Street house, during Edith's recovery from her confinement, gave her the
natural rest which she needed. It gave her time to comprehend the sudden
change which had taken place in her circumstances within the last two
months. She found herself at once an inmate of a luxurious house, where
the bare knowledge of the existence of every trouble or care seemed
scarcely to have penetrated. The wheels of the machinery of daily life
were well oiled, and went along with delicious smoothness. Mrs. Shaw and
Edith could hardly make enough of Margaret, on her return to what they
persisted in calling her home. And she felt that it was almost
ungrateful in her to have a secret feeling that the Helstone
vicarage--nay, even the poor little house at Milton, with her anxious
father and her invalid mother, and all the small household cares of
comparative poverty, composed her idea of home. Edith was impatient to
get well, in order to fill Margaret's bed-room with all the soft
comforts, and pretty nick-knacks, with which her own abounded. Mrs. Shaw
and her maid found plenty of occupation in restoring Margaret's wardrobe
to a state of elegant variety. Captain Lennox was easy, kind, and
gentlemanly; sate with his wife in her dressing-room an hour or two
every day; played with his little boy for another hour, and lounged away
the rest of his time at his club, when he was not engaged out to dinner.
Just before Margaret had recovered from her necessity for quiet and
repose--before she had begun to feel her life wanting and dull--Edith
came down-stairs and resumed her usual part in the household; and
Margaret fell into the old habit of watching, and admiring, and
ministering to her cousin. She gladly took all charge of the semblances
of duties off Edith's hands; answered notes, reminded her of
engagements, tended her when no gaiety was in prospect, and she was
consequently rather inclined to fancy herself ill. But all the rest of
the family were in the full business of the London season, and Margaret
was often left alone. Then her thoughts went back to Milton, with a
strange sense of the contrast between the life there, and here. She was
getting surfeited of the eventless ease in which no struggle or
endeavour was required. She was afraid lest she should even become
sleepily deadened into forgetfulness of anything beyond the life which
was lapping her round with luxury. There might be toilers and moilers
there in London, but she never saw them; the very servants lived in an
underground world of their own, of which she knew neither the hopes nor
the fears; they only seemed to start into existence when some want or
whim of their master and mistress needed them. There was a strange
unsatisfied vacuum in Margaret's heart and mode of life; and, once when
she had dimly hinted this to Edith, the latter, wearied with dancing the
night before, languidly stroked Margaret's cheek as she sat by her in
the old attitude,--she on a footstool by the sofa where Edith lay.

'Poor child!' said Edith. 'It is a little sad for you to be left, night
after night, just at this time when all the world is so gay. But we
shall be having our dinner-parties soon--as soon as Henry comes back
from circuit--and then there will be a little pleasant variety for you.
No wonder it is moped, poor darling!'

Margaret did not feel as if the dinner-parties would be a panacea. But
Edith piqued herself on her dinner-parties; 'so different,' as she said,
'from the old dowager dinners under mamma's regime;' and Mrs. Shaw
herself seemed to take exactly the same kind of pleasure in the very
different arrangements and circle of acquaintances which were to Captain
and Mrs. Lennox's taste, as she did in the more formal and ponderous
entertainments which she herself used to give. Captain Lennox was always
extremely kind and brotherly to Margaret. She was really very fond of
him, excepting when he was anxiously attentive to Edith's dress and
appearance, with a view to her beauty making a sufficient impression on
the world. Then all the latent Vashti in Margaret was roused, and she
could hardly keep herself from expressing her feelings.

The course of Margaret's day was this; a quiet hour or two before a late
breakfast; an unpunctual meal, lazily eaten by weary and half-awake
people, but yet at which, in all its dragged-out length, she was
expected to be present, because, directly afterwards, came a discussion
of plans, at which, although they none of them concerned her, she was
expected to give her sympathy, if she could not assist with her advice;
an endless number of notes to write, which Edith invariably left to her,
with many caressing compliments as to her eloquence du billet; a little
play with Sholto as he returned from his morning's walk; besides the
care of the children during the servants' dinner; a drive or callers;
and some dinner or morning engagement for her aunt and cousins, which
left Margaret free, it is true, but rather wearied with the inactivity
of the day, coming upon depressed spirits and delicate health.

She looked forward with longing, though unspoken interest to the homely
object of Dixon's return from Milton; where, until now, the old servant
had been busily engaged in winding up all the affairs of the Hale
family. It had appeared a sudden famine to her heart, this entire
cessation of any news respecting the people amongst whom she had lived
so long. It was true, that Dixon, in her business-letters, quoted, every
now and then, an opinion of Mr. Thornton's as to what she had better do
about the furniture, or how act in regard to the landlord of the
Crampton Terrace house. But it was only here and there that the name
came in, or any Milton name, indeed; and Margaret was sitting one
evening, all alone in the Lennoxes's drawing-room, not reading Dixon's
letters, which yet she held in her hand, but thinking over them, and
recalling the days which had been, and picturing the busy life out of
which her own had been taken and never missed; wondering if all went on
in that whirl just as if she and her father had never been; questioning
within herself, if no one in all the crowd missed her, (not Higgins, she
was not thinking of him,) when, suddenly, Mr. Bell was announced; and
Margaret hurried the letters into her work-basket, and started up,
blushing as if she had been doing some guilty thing.

'Oh, Mr. Bell! I never thought of seeing you!'

'But you give me a welcome, I hope, as well as that very pretty start of
surprise.'

'Have you dined? How did you come? Let me order you some dinner.'

'If you're going to have any. Otherwise, you know, there is no one who
cares less for eating than I do. But where are the others? Gone out to
dinner? Left you alone?'

'Oh yes! and it is such a rest. I was just thinking--But will you run
the risk of dinner? I don't know if there is anything in the house.'

'Why, to tell you the truth, I dined at my club. Only they don't cook as
well as they did, so I thought, if you were going to dine, I might try
and make out my dinner. But never mind, never mind! There aren't ten
cooks in England to be trusted at impromptu dinners. If their skill and
their fires will stand it, their tempers won't. You shall make me some
tea, Margaret. And now, what were you thinking of? you were going to
tell me. Whose letters were those, god-daughter, that you hid away so
speedily?'

'Only Dixon's,' replied Margaret, growing very red.

'Whew! is that all? Who do you think came up in the train with me?'

'I don't know,' said Margaret, resolved against making a guess.

'Your what d'ye call him? What's the right name for a cousin-in-law's
brother?'

'Mr. Henry Lennox?' asked Margaret.

'Yes,' replied Mr. Bell. 'You knew him formerly, didn't you? What sort
of a person is he, Margaret?'

'I liked him long ago,' said Margaret, glancing down for a moment. And
then she looked straight up and went on in her natural manner. 'You know
we have been corresponding about Frederick since; but I have not seen
him for nearly three years, and he may be changed. What did you think of
him?'

'I don't know. He was so busy trying to find out who I was, in the first
instance, and what I was in the second, that he never let out what he
was; unless indeed that veiled curiosity of his as to what manner of man
he had to talk to was not a good piece, and a fair indication of his
character. Do you call him good looking, Margaret?'

'No! certainly not. Do you?'

'Not I. But I thought, perhaps, you might. Is he a great deal here?'

'I fancy he is when he is in town. He has been on circuit now since I
came. But--Mr. Bell--have you come from Oxford or from Milton?'

'From Milton. Don't you see I'm smoke-dried?'

'Certainly. But I thought that it might be the effect of the antiquities
of Oxford.'

'Come now, be a sensible woman! In Oxford, I could have managed all the
landlords in the place, and had my own way, with half the trouble your
Milton landlord has given me, and defeated me after all. He won't take
the house off our hands till next June twelvemonth. Luckily, Mr.
Thornton found a tenant for it. Why don't you ask after Mr. Thornton,
Margaret? He has proved himself a very active friend of yours, I can
tell you. Taken more than half the trouble off my hands.'

'And how is he? How is Mrs. Thornton?' asked Margaret hurriedly and
below her breath, though she tried to speak out.

'I suppose they're well. I've been staying at their house till I was
driven out of it by the perpetual clack about that Thornton girl's
marriage. It was too much for Thornton himself, though she was his
sister. He used to go and sit in his own room perpetually. He's getting
past the age for caring for such things, either as principal or
accessory. I was surprised to find the old lady falling into the
current, and carried away by her daughter's enthusiasm for
orange-blossoms and lace. I thought Mrs. Thornton had been made of
sterner stuff.'

'She would put on any assumption of feeling to veil her daughter's
weakness,' said Margaret in a low voice.

'Perhaps so. You've studied her, have you? She doesn't seem over fond of
you, Margaret.'

'I know it,' said Margaret. 'Oh, here is tea at last!' exclaimed she, as
if relieved. And with tea came Mr. Henry Lennox, who had walked up to
Harley Street after a late dinner, and had evidently expected to find
his brother and sister-in-law at home. Margaret suspected him of being
as thankful as she was at the presence of a third party, on this their
first meeting since the memorable day of his offer, and her refusal at
Helstone. She could hardly tell what to say at first, and was thankful
for all the tea-table occupations, which gave her an excuse for keeping
silence, and him an opportunity of recovering himself. For, to tell the
truth, he had rather forced himself up to Harley Street this evening,
with a view of getting over an awkward meeting, awkward even in the
presence of Captain Lennox and Edith, and doubly awkward now that he
found her the only lady there, and the person to whom he must naturally
and perforce address a great part of his conversation. She was the first
to recover her self-possession. She began to talk on the subject which
came uppermost in her mind, after the first flush of awkward shyness.

'Mr. Lennox, I have been so much obliged to you for all you have done
about Frederick.'

'I am only sorry it has been so unsuccessful,' replied he, with a quick
glance towards Mr. Bell, as if reconnoitring how much he might say
before him. Margaret, as if she read his thought, addressed herself to
Mr. Bell, both including him in the conversation, and implying that he
was perfectly aware of the endeavours that had been made to clear
Frederick.

'That Horrocks--that very last witness of all, has proved as unavailing
as all the others. Mr. Lennox has discovered that he sailed for
Australia only last August; only two months before Frederick was in
England, and gave us the names of---- '

'Frederick in England! you never told me that!' exclaimed Mr. Bell in
surprise.

'I thought you knew. I never doubted you had been told. Of course, it
was a great secret, and perhaps I should not have named it now,' said
Margaret, a little dismayed.

'I have never named it to either my brother or your cousin,' said Mr.
Lennox, with a little professional dryness of implied reproach.

'Never mind, Margaret. I am not living in a talking, babbling world, nor
yet among people who are trying to worm facts out of me; you needn't
look so frightened because you have let the cat out of the bag to a
faithful old hermit like me. I shall never name his having been in
England; I shall be out of temptation, for no one will ask me. Stay!'
(interrupting himself rather abruptly) 'was it at your mother's
funeral?'

'He was with mamma when she died,' said Margaret, softly.

'To be sure! To be sure! Why, some one asked me if he had not been over
then, and I denied it stoutly--not many weeks ago--who could it have
been? Oh! I recollect!'

But he did not say the name; and although Margaret would have given much
to know if her suspicions were right, and it had been Mr. Thornton who
had made the enquiry, she could not ask the question of Mr. Bell, much
as she longed to do so.

There was a pause for a moment or two. Then Mr. Lennox said, addressing
himself to Margaret, 'I suppose as Mr. Bell is now acquainted with all
the circumstances attending your brother's unfortunate dilemma, I cannot
do better than inform him exactly how the research into the evidence we
once hoped to produce in his favour stands at present. So, if he will do
me the honour to breakfast with me to-morrow, we will go over the names
of these missing gentry.'

'I should like to hear all the particulars, if I may. Cannot you come
here? I dare not ask you both to breakfast, though I am sure you would
be welcome. But let me know all I can about Frederick, even though there
may be no hope at present.'

'I have an engagement at half-past eleven. But I will certainly come if
you wish it,' replied Mr. Lennox, with a little afterthought of extreme
willingness, which made Margaret shrink into herself, and almost wish
that she had not proposed her natural request. Mr. Bell got up and
looked around him for his hat, which had been removed to make room for
tea.

'Well!' said he, 'I don't know what Mr. Lennox is inclined to do, but
I'm disposed to be moving off homewards. I've been a journey to-day, and
journeys begin to tell upon my sixty and odd years.'

'I believe I shall stay and see my brother and sister,' said Mr. Lennox,
making no movement of departure. Margaret was seized with a shy awkward
dread of being left alone with him. The scene on the little terrace in
the Helstone garden was so present to her, that she could hardly help
believing it was so with him.

'Don't go yet, please, Mr. Bell,' said she, hastily. 'I want you to see
Edith; and I want Edith to know you. Please!' said she, laying a light
but determined hand on his arm. He looked at her, and saw the confusion
stirring in her countenance; he sate down again, as if her little touch
had been possessed of resistless strength.

'You see how she overpowers me, Mr. Lennox,' said he. 'And I hope you
noticed the happy choice of her expressions; she wants me to "see" this
cousin Edith, who, I am told, is a great beauty; but she has the honesty
to change her word when she comes to me--Mrs. Lennox is to "know" me. I
suppose I am not much to "see," eh, Margaret?'

He joked, to give her time to recover from the slight flutter which he
had detected in her manner on his proposal to leave; and she caught the
tone, and threw the ball back. Mr. Lennox wondered how his brother, the
Captain, could have reported her as having lost all her good looks. To
be sure, in her quiet black dress, she was a contrast to Edith, dancing
in her white crape mourning, and long floating golden hair, all softness
and glitter. She dimpled and blushed most becomingly when introduced to
Mr. Bell, conscious that she had her reputation as a beauty to keep up,
and that it would not do to have a Mordecai refusing to worship and
admire, even in the shape of an old Fellow of a College, which nobody
had ever heard of. Mrs. Shaw and Captain Lennox, each in their separate
way, gave Mr. Bell a kind and sincere welcome, winning him over to like
them almost in spite of himself, especially when he saw how naturally
Margaret took her place as sister and daughter of the house.

'What a shame that we were not at home to receive you,' said Edith.
'You, too, Henry! though I don't know that we should have stayed at home
for you. And for Mr. Bell! for Margaret's Mr. Bell---- '

'There is no knowing what sacrifices you would not have made,' said her
brother-in-law. 'Even a dinner-party! and the delight of wearing this
very becoming dress.'

Edith did not know whether to frown or to smile. But it did not suit Mr.
Lennox to drive her to the first of these alternatives; so he went on.

'Will you show your readiness to make sacrifices to-morrow morning,
first by asking me to breakfast, to meet Mr. Bell, and secondly, by
being so kind as to order it at half-past nine, instead of ten o'clock?
I have some letters and papers that I want to show to Miss Hale and Mr.
Bell.'

'I hope Mr. Bell will make our house his own during his stay in London,'
said Captain Lennox. 'I am only so sorry we cannot offer him a
bed-room.'

'Thank you. I am much obliged to you. You would only think me a churl if
you had, for I should decline it, I believe, in spite of all the
temptations of such agreeable company,' said Mr. Bell, bowing all round,
and secretly congratulating himself on the neat turn he had given to his
sentence, which, if put into plain language, would have been more to
this effect: 'I couldn't stand the restraints of such a proper-behaved
and civil-spoken set of people as these are: it would be like meat
without salt. I'm thankful they haven't a bed. And how well I rounded my
sentence! I am absolutely catching the trick of good manners.'

His self-satisfaction lasted him till he was fairly out in the streets,
walking side by side with Henry Lennox. Here he suddenly remembered
Margaret's little look of entreaty as she urged him to stay longer, and
he also recollected a few hints given him long ago by an acquaintance of
Mr. Lennox's, as to his admiration of Margaret. It gave a new direction
to his thoughts. 'You have known Miss Hale for a long time, I believe.
How do you think her looking? She strikes me as pale and ill.'

'I thought her looking remarkably well. Perhaps not when I first came
in--now I think of it. But certainly, when she grew animated, she looked
as well as ever I saw her do.'

'She has had a great deal to go through,' said Mr. Bell.

'Yes! I have been sorry to hear of all she has had to bear; not merely
the common and universal sorrow arising from death, but all the
annoyance which her father's conduct must have caused her, and then----'

'Her father's conduct!' said Mr. Bell, in an accent of surprise. 'You
must have heard some wrong statement. He behaved in the most
conscientious manner. He showed more resolute strength than I should
ever have given him credit for formerly.'

'Perhaps I have been wrongly informed. But I have been told, by his
successor in the living--a clever, sensible man, and a thoroughly active
clergyman--that there was no call upon Mr. Hale to do what he did,
relinquish the living, and throw himself and his family on the tender
mercies of private teaching in a manufacturing town; the bishop had
offered him another living, it is true, but if he had come to entertain
certain doubts, he could have remained where he was, and so had no
occasion to resign. But the truth is, these country clergymen live such
isolated lives--isolated, I mean, from all intercourse with men of equal
cultivation with themselves, by whose minds they might regulate their
own, and discover when they were going either too fast or too slow--that
they are very apt to disturb themselves with imaginary doubts as to the
articles of faith, and throw up certain opportunities of doing good for
very uncertain fancies of their own.'

'I differ from you. I do not think they are very apt to do as my poor
friend Hale did.' Mr. Bell was inwardly chafing.

'Perhaps I used too general an expression, in saying "very apt." But
certainly, their lives are such as very often to produce either
inordinate self-sufficiency, or a morbid state of conscience,' replied
Mr. Lennox with perfect coolness.

'You don't meet with any self-sufficiency among the lawyers, for
instance?' asked Mr. Bell. 'And seldom, I imagine, any cases of morbid
conscience.' He was becoming more and more vexed, and forgetting his
lately-caught trick of good manners. Mr. Lennox saw now that he had
annoyed his companion; and as he had talked pretty much for the sake of
saying something, and so passing the time while their road lay together,
he was very indifferent as to the exact side he took upon the question,
and quietly came round by saying: 'To be sure, there is something fine
in a man of Mr. Hale's age leaving his home of twenty years, and giving
up all settled habits, for an idea which was probably erroneous--but
that does not matter--an untangible thought. One cannot help admiring
him, with a mixture of pity in one's admiration, something like what one
feels for Don Quixote. Such a gentleman as he was too! I shall never
forget the refined and simple hospitality he showed to me that last day
at Helstone.'

Only half mollified, and yet anxious, in order to lull certain qualms of
his own conscience, to believe that Mr. Hale's conduct had a tinge of
Quixotism in it, Mr. Bell growled out--'Aye! And you don't know Milton.
Such a change from Helstone! It is years since I have been at
Helstone--but I'll answer for it, it is standing there yet--every stick
and every stone as it has done for the last century, while Milton! I go
there every four or five years--and I was born there--yet I do assure
you, I often lose my way--aye, among the very piles of warehouses that
are built upon my father's orchard. Do we part here? Well, good night,
sir; I suppose we shall meet in Harley Street to-morrow morning.'




CHAPTER XLV

NOT ALL A DREAM

    'Where are the sounds that swam along
     The buoyant air when I was young?
     The last vibration now is o'er,
     And they who listened are no more;
     Ah! let me close my eyes and dream.'
              W. S. LANDOR.


The idea of Helstone had been suggested to Mr. Bell's waking mind by his
conversation with Mr. Lennox, and all night long it ran riot through his
dreams. He was again the tutor in the college where he now held the rank
of Fellow; it was again a long vacation, and he was staying with his
newly married friend, the proud husband, and happy Vicar of Helstone.
Over babbling brooks they took impossible leaps, which seemed to keep
them whole days suspended in the air. Time and space were not, though
all other things seemed real. Every event was measured by the emotions
of the mind, not by its actual existence, for existence it had none. But
the trees were gorgeous in their autumnal leafiness--the warm odours of
flower and herb came sweet upon the sense--the young wife moved about
her house with just that mixture of annoyance at her position, as
regarded wealth, with pride in her handsome and devoted husband, which
Mr. Bell had noticed in real life a quarter of a century ago. The dream
was so like life that, when he awoke, his present life seemed like a
dream. Where was he? In the close, handsomely furnished room of a London
hotel! Where were those who spoke to him, moved around him, touched him,
not an instant ago? Dead! buried! lost for evermore, as far as earth's
for evermore would extend. He was an old man, so lately exultant in the
full strength of manhood. The utter loneliness of his life was
insupportable to think about. He got up hastily, and tried to forget
what never more might be, in a hurried dressing for the breakfast in
Harley Street.

He could not attend to all the lawyer's details, which, as he saw, made
Margaret's eyes dilate, and her lips grow pale, as one by one fate
decreed, or so it seemed, every morsel of evidence which would exonerate
Frederick, should fall from beneath her feet and disappear. Even Mr.
Lennox's well-regulated professional voice took a softer, tenderer tone,
as he drew near to the extinction of the last hope. It was not that
Margaret had not been perfectly aware of the result before. It was only
that the details of each successive disappointment came with such
relentless minuteness to quench all hope, that she at last fairly gave
way to tears. Mr. Lennox stopped reading.

'I had better not go on,' said he, in a concerned voice. 'It was a
foolish proposal of mine. Lieutenant Hale,' and even this giving him the
title of the service from which he had so harshly been expelled, was
soothing to Margaret, 'Lieutenant Hale is happy now; more secure in
fortune and future prospects than he could ever have been in the navy;
and has, doubtless, adopted his wife's country as his own.'

'That is it,' said Margaret. 'It seems so selfish in me to regret it,'
trying to smile, 'and yet he is lost to me, and I am so lonely.' Mr.
Lennox turned over his papers, and wished that he were as rich and
prosperous as he believed he should be some day. Mr. Bell blew his nose,
but, otherwise, he also kept silence; and Margaret, in a minute or two,
had apparently recovered her usual composure. She thanked Mr. Lennox
very courteously for his trouble; all the more courteously and
graciously because she was conscious that, by her behaviour, he might
have probably been led to imagine that he had given her needless pain.
Yet it was pain she would not have been without.

Mr. Bell came up to wish her good-bye.

'Margaret!' said he, as he fumbled with his gloves. 'I am going down to
Helstone to-morrow, to look at the old place. Would you like to come
with me? Or would it give you too much pain? Speak out, don't be
afraid.'

'Oh, Mr. Bell,' said she--and could say no more. But she took his old
gouty hand, and kissed it.

'Come, come; that's enough,' said he, reddening with awkwardness. 'I
suppose your aunt Shaw will trust you with me. We'll go to-morrow
morning, and we shall get there about two o'clock, I fancy. We'll take a
snack, and order dinner at the little inn--the Lennard Arms, it used to
be,--and go and get an appetite in the forest. Can you stand it,
Margaret? It will be a trial, I know, to both of us, but it will be a
pleasure to me, at least. And there we'll dine--it will be but
doe-venison, if we can get it at all--and then I'll take my nap while
you go out and see old friends. I'll give you back safe and sound,
barring railway accidents, and I'll insure your life for a thousand
pounds before starting, which may be some comfort to your relations; but
otherwise, I'll bring you back to Mrs. Shaw by lunch-time on Friday. So,
if you say yes, I'll just go up-stairs and propose it.'

'It's no use my trying to say how much I shall like it,' said Margaret,
through her tears.

'Well, then, prove your gratitude by keeping those fountains of yours
dry for the next two days. If you don't, I shall feel queer myself about
the lachrymal ducts, and I don't like that.'

'I won't cry a drop,' said Margaret, winking her eyes to shake the tears
off her eye-lashes, and forcing a smile.

'There's my good girl. Then we'll go up-stairs and settle it all.'
Margaret was in a state of almost trembling eagerness, while Mr. Bell
discussed his plan with her aunt Shaw, who was first startled, then
doubtful and perplexed, and in the end, yielding rather to the rough
force of Mr. Bell's words than to her own conviction; for to the last,
whether it was right or wrong, proper or improper, she could not settle
to her own satisfaction, till Margaret's safe return, the happy
fulfilment of the project, gave her decision enough to say, 'she was
sure it had been a very kind thought of Mr. Bell's, and just what she
herself had been wishing for Margaret, as giving her the very change
which she required, after all the anxious time she had had.'




CHAPTER XLVI

ONCE AND NOW

    'So on those happy days of yore
     Oft as I dare to dwell once more,
     Still must I miss the friends so tried,
     Whom Death has severed from my side.

     But ever when true friendship binds,
     Spirit it is that spirit finds;
     In spirit then our bliss we found,
     In spirit yet to them I'm bound.'
              UHLAND.


Margaret was ready long before the appointed time, and had leisure
enough to cry a little, quietly, when unobserved, and to smile brightly
when any one looked at her. Her last alarm was lest they should be too
late and miss the train; but no! they were all in time; and she breathed
freely and happily at length, seated in the carriage opposite to Mr.
Bell, and whirling away past the well-known stations; seeing the old
south country-towns and hamlets sleeping in the warm light of the pure
sun, which gave a yet ruddier colour to their tiled roofs, so different
to the cold slates of the north. Broods of pigeons hovered around these
peaked quaint gables, slowly settling here and there, and ruffling their
soft, shiny feathers, as if exposing every fibre to the delicious
warmth. There were few people about at the stations, it almost seemed as
if they were too lazily content to wish to travel; none of the bustle
and stir that Margaret had noticed in her two journeys on the London and
North-Western line. Later on in the year, this line of railway should be
stirring and alive with rich pleasure-seekers; but as to the constant
going to and fro of busy trades-people it would always be widely
different from the northern lines. Here a spectator or two stood
lounging at nearly every station, with his hands in his pockets, so
absorbed in the simple act of watching, that it made the travellers
wonder what he could find to do when the train whirled away, and only
the blank of a railway, some sheds, and a distant field or two were left
for him to gaze upon. The hot air danced over the golden stillness of
the land, farm after farm was left behind, each reminding Margaret of
German Idyls--of Herman and Dorothea--of Evangeline. From this waking
dream she was roused. It was the place to leave the train and take the
fly to Helstone. And now sharper feelings came shooting through her
heart, whether pain or pleasure she could hardly tell. Every mile was
redolent of associations, which she would not have missed for the world,
but each of which made her cry upon 'the days that are no more,' with
ineffable longing. The last time she had passed along this road was when
she had left it with her father and mother--the day, the season, had
been gloomy, and she herself hopeless, but they were there with her. Now
she was alone, an orphan, and they, strangely, had gone away from her,
and vanished from the face of the earth. It hurt her to see the Helstone
road so flooded in the sun-light, and every turn and every familiar tree
so precisely the same in its summer glory as it had been in former
years. Nature felt no change, and was ever young.

Mr. Bell knew something of what would be passing through her mind, and
wisely and kindly held his tongue. They drove up to the Lennard Arms;
half farm-house, half-inn, standing a little apart from the road, as
much as to say, that the host did not so depend on the custom of
travellers, as to have to court it by any obtrusiveness; they, rather,
must seek him out. The house fronted the village green; and right before
it stood an immemorial lime-tree benched all round, in some hidden
recesses of whose leafy wealth hung the grim escutcheon of the Lennards.
The door of the inn stood wide open, but there was no hospitable hurry
to receive the travellers. When the landlady did appear--and they might
have abstracted many an article first--she gave them a kind welcome,
almost as if they had been invited guests, and apologised for her coming
having been so delayed, by saying, that it was hay-time, and the
provisions for the men had to be sent a-field, and she had been too busy
packing up the baskets to hear the noise of wheels over the road, which,
since they had left the highway, ran over soft short turf.

'Why, bless me!' exclaimed she, as at the end of her apology, a glint of
sunlight showed her Margaret's face, hitherto unobserved in that shady
parlour. 'It's Miss Hale, Jenny,' said she, running to the door, and
calling to her daughter. 'Come here, come directly, it's Miss Hale!' And
then she went up to Margaret, and shook her hands with motherly
fondness.

'And how are you all? How's the Vicar and Miss Dixon? The Vicar above
all! God bless him! We've never ceased to be sorry that he left.'

Margaret tried to speak and tell her of her father's death; of her
mother's it was evident that Mrs. Purkis was aware, from her omission of
her name. But she choked in the effort, and could only touch her deep
mourning, and say the one word, 'Papa.'

'Surely, sir, it's never so!' said Mrs. Purkis, turning to Mr. Bell for
confirmation of the sad suspicion that now entered her mind. 'There was
a gentleman here in the spring--it might have been as long ago as last
winter--who told us a deal of Mr. Hale and Miss Margaret; and he said
Mrs. Hale was gone, poor lady. But never a word of the Vicar's being
ailing!'

'It is so, however,' said Mr. Bell. 'He died quite suddenly, when on a
visit to me at Oxford. He was a good man, Mrs. Purkis, and there's many
of us that might be thankful to have as calm an end as his. Come
Margaret, my dear! Her father was my oldest friend, and she's my
god-daughter, so I thought we would just come down together and see the
old place; and I know of old you can give us comfortable rooms and a
capital dinner. You don't remember me I see, but my name is Bell, and
once or twice when the parsonage has been full, I've slept here, and
tasted your good ale.'

'To be sure; I ask your pardon; but you see I was taken up with Miss
Hale. Let me show you to a room, Miss Margaret, where you can take off
your bonnet, and wash your face. It's only this very morning I plunged
some fresh-gathered roses head downward in the water-jug, for, thought
I, perhaps some one will be coming, and there's nothing so sweet as
spring-water scented by a musk rose or two. To think of the Vicar being
dead! Well, to be sure, we must all die; only that gentleman said, he
was quite picking up after his trouble about Mrs. Hale's death.'

'Come down to me, Mrs. Purkis, after you have attended to Miss Hale. I
want to have a consultation with you about dinner.'

The little casement window in Margaret's bed-chamber was almost filled
up with rose and vine branches; but pushing them aside, and stretching a
little out, she could see the tops of the parsonage chimneys above the
trees; and distinguish many a well-known line through the leaves.

'Aye!' said Mrs. Purkis, smoothing down the bed, and despatching Jenny
for an armful of lavender-scented towels, 'times is changed, miss; our
new Vicar has seven children, and is building a nursery ready for more,
just out where the arbour and tool-house used to be in old times. And he
has had new grates put in, and a plate-glass window in the drawing-room.
He and his wife are stirring people, and have done a deal of good; at
least they say it's doing good; if it were not, I should call it turning
things upside down for very little purpose. The new Vicar is a
teetotaller, miss, and a magistrate, and his wife has a deal of receipts
for economical cooking, and is for making bread without yeast; and they
both talk so much, and both at a time, that they knock one down as it
were, and it's not till they're gone, and one's a little at peace, that
one can think that there were things one might have said on one's own
side of the question. He'll be after the men's cans in the hay-field,
and peeping in; and then there'll be an ado because it's not ginger
beer, but I can't help it. My mother and my grandmother before me sent
good malt liquor to haymakers; and took salts and senna when anything
ailed them; and I must e'en go on in their ways, though Mrs. Hepworth
does want to give me comfits instead of medicine, which, as she says, is
a deal pleasanter, only I've no faith in it. But I must go, miss, though
I'm wanting to hear many a thing; I'll come back to you before long.

Mr. Bell had strawberries and cream, a loaf of brown bread, and a jug of
milk, (together with a Stilton cheese and a bottle of port for his own
private refreshment,) ready for Margaret on her coming down stairs; and
after this rustic luncheon they set out to walk, hardly knowing in what
direction to turn, so many old familiar inducements were there in each.

'Shall we go past the vicarage?' asked Mr. Bell.

'No, not yet. We will go this way, and make a round so as to come back
by it,' replied Margaret.

Here and there old trees had been felled the autumn before; or a
squatter's roughly-built and decaying cottage had disappeared. Margaret
missed them each and all, and grieved over them like old friends. They
came past the spot where she and Mr. Lennox had sketched. The white,
lightning-scarred trunk of the venerable beech, among whose roots they
had sate down was there no more; the old man, the inhabitant of the
ruinous cottage, was dead; the cottage had been pulled down, and a new
one, tidy and respectable, had been built in its stead. There was a
small garden on the place where the beech-tree had been.

'I did not think I had been so old,' said Margaret after a pause of
silence; and she turned away sighing.

'Yes!' said Mr. Bell. 'It is the first changes among familiar things
that make such a mystery of time to the young, afterwards we lose the
sense of the mysterious. I take changes in all I see as a matter of
course. The instability of all human things is familiar to me, to you it
is new and oppressive.'

'Let us go on to see little Susan,' said Margaret, drawing her companion
up a grassy road-way, leading under the shadow of a forest glade.

'With all my heart, though I have not an idea who little Susan may be.
But I have a kindness for all Susans, for simple Susan's sake.'

'My little Susan was disappointed when I left without wishing her
goodbye; and it has been on my conscience ever since, that I gave her
pain which a little more exertion on my part might have prevented. But
it is a long way. Are you sure you will not be tired?'

'Quite sure. That is, if you don't walk so fast. You see, here there are
no views that can give one an excuse for stopping to take breath. You
would think it romantic to be walking with a person "fat and scant o'
breath" if I were Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Have compassion on my
infirmities for his sake.'

'I will walk slower for your own sake. I like you twenty times better
than Hamlet.'

'On the principle that a living ass is better than a dead lion?'

'Perhaps so. I don't analyse my feelings.'

'I am content to take your liking me, without examining too curiously
into the materials it is made of. Only we need not walk at a snail's'
pace.'

'Very well. Walk at your own pace, and I will follow. Or stop still and
meditate, like the Hamlet you compare yourself to, if I go too fast.'

'Thank you. But as my mother has not murdered my father, and afterwards
married my uncle, I shouldn't know what to think about, unless it were
balancing the chances of our having a well-cooked dinner or not. What do
you think?'

'I am in good hopes. She used to be considered a famous cook as far as
Helstone opinion went.'

'But have you considered the distraction of mind produced by all this
haymaking?'

Margaret felt all Mr. Bell's kindness in trying to make cheerful talk
about nothing, to endeavour to prevent her from thinking too curiously
about the past. But she would rather have gone over these dear-loved
walks in silence, if indeed she were not ungrateful enough to wish that
she might have been alone.

They reached the cottage where Susan's widowed mother lived. Susan was
not there. She was gone to the parochial school. Margaret was
disappointed, and the poor woman saw it, and began to make a kind of
apology.

'Oh! it is quite right,' said Margaret. 'I am very glad to hear it. I
might have thought of it. Only she used to stop at home with you.'

'Yes, she did; and I miss her sadly. I used to teach her what little I
knew at nights. It were not much to be sure. But she were getting such a
handy girl, that I miss her sore. But she's a deal above me in learning
now.' And the mother sighed.

'I'm all wrong,' growled Mr. Bell. 'Don't mind what I say. I'm a hundred
years behind the world. But I should say, that the child was getting a
better and simpler, and more natural education stopping at home, and
helping her mother, and learning to read a chapter in the New Testament
every night by her side, than from all the schooling under the sun.'

Margaret did not want to encourage him to go on by replying to him, and
so prolonging the discussion before the mother. So she turned to her and
asked,

'How is old Betty Barnes?'

'I don't know,' said the woman rather shortly. 'We'se not friends.'

'Why not?' asked Margaret, who had formerly been the peacemaker of the
village.

'She stole my cat.'

'Did she know it was yours?'

'I don't know. I reckon not.'

'Well! could not you get it back again when you told her it was yours?'

'No! for she'd burnt it.'

'Burnt it!' exclaimed both Margaret and Mr. Bell.

'Roasted it!' explained the woman.

It was no explanation. By dint of questioning, Margaret extracted from
her the horrible fact that Betty Barnes, having been induced by a gypsy
fortune-teller to lend the latter her husband's Sunday clothes, on
promise of having them faithfully returned on the Saturday night before
Goodman Barnes should have missed them, became alarmed by their
non-appearance, and her consequent dread of her husband's anger, and as,
according to one of the savage country superstitions, the cries of a
cat, in the agonies of being boiled or roasted alive, compelled (as it
were) the powers of darkness to fulfil the wishes of the executioner,
resort had been had to the charm. The poor woman evidently believed in
its efficacy; her only feeling was indignation that her cat had been
chosen out from all others for a sacrifice. Margaret listened in horror;
and endeavoured in vain to enlighten the woman's mind; but she was
obliged to give it up in despair. Step by step she got the woman to
admit certain facts, of which the logical connexion and sequence was
perfectly clear to Margaret; but at the end, the bewildered woman simply
repeated her first assertion, namely, that 'it were very cruel for sure,
and she should not like to do it; but that there were nothing like it
for giving a person what they wished for; she had heard it all her life;
but it were very cruel for all that.' Margaret gave it up in despair,
and walked away sick at heart.

'You are a good girl not to triumph over me,' said Mr. Bell.

'How? What do you mean?'

'I own, I am wrong about schooling. Anything rather than have that child
brought up in such practical paganism.'

'Oh! I remember. Poor little Susan! I must go and see her; would you
mind calling at the school?'

'Not a bit. I am curious to see something of the teaching she is to
receive.'

They did not speak much more, but thridded their way through many a
bosky dell, whose soft green influence could not charm away the shock
and the pain in Margaret's heart, caused by the recital of such cruelty;
a recital too, the manner of which betrayed such utter want of
imagination, and therefore of any sympathy with the suffering animal.

The buzz of voices, like the murmur of a hive of busy human bees, made
itself heard as soon as they emerged from the forest on the more open
village-green on which the school was situated. The door was wide open,
and they entered. A brisk lady in black, here, there, and everywhere,
perceived them, and bade them welcome with somewhat of the hostess-air
which, Margaret remembered, her mother was wont to assume, only in a
more soft and languid manner, when any rare visitors strayed in to
inspect the school. She knew at once it was the present Vicar's wife,
her mother's successor; and she would have drawn back from the interview
had it been possible; but in an instant she had conquered this feeling,
and modestly advanced, meeting many a bright glance of recognition, and
hearing many a half-suppressed murmur of 'It's Miss Hale.' The Vicar's
lady heard the name, and her manner at once became more kindly. Margaret
wished she could have helped feeling that it also became more
patronising. The lady held out a hand to Mr. Bell, with--

'Your father, I presume, Miss Hale. I see it by the likeness. I am sure
I am very glad to see you, sir, and so will the Vicar be.'

Margaret explained that it was not her father, and stammered out the
fact of his death; wondering all the time how Mr. Hale could have borne
coming to revisit Helstone, if it had been as the Vicar's lady supposed.
She did not hear what Mrs. Hepworth was saying, and left it to Mr. Bell
to reply, looking round, meanwhile, for her old acquaintances.

'Ah! I see you would like to take a class, Miss Hale. I know it by
myself. First class stand up for a parsing lesson with Miss Hale.'

Poor Margaret, whose visit was sentimental, not in any degree
inspective, felt herself taken in; but as in some way bringing her in
contact with little eager faces, once well-known, and who had received
the solemn rite of baptism from her father, she sate down, half losing
herself in tracing out the changing features of the girls, and holding
Susan's hand for a minute or two, unobserved by all, while the first
class sought for their books, and the Vicar's lady went as near as a
lady could towards holding Mr. Bell by the button, while she explained
the Phonetic system to him, and gave him a conversation she had had with
the Inspector about it.

Margaret bent over her book, and seeing nothing but that--hearing the
buzz of children's voices, old times rose up, and she thought of them,
and her eyes filled with tears, till all at once there was a pause--one
of the girls was stumbling over the apparently simple word 'a,'
uncertain what to call it.

'A, an indefinite article,' said Margaret, mildly.

'I beg your pardon,' said the Vicar's wife, all eyes and ears; 'but we
are taught by Mr. Milsome to call "a" an--who can remember?'

'An adjective absolute,' said half-a-dozen voices at once. And Margaret
sate abashed. The children knew more than she did. Mr. Bell turned away,
and smiled.

Margaret spoke no more during the lesson. But after it was over, she
went quietly round to one or two old favourites, and talked to them a
little. They were growing out of children into great girls; passing out
of her recollection in their rapid development, as she, by her three
years' absence, was vanishing from theirs. Still she was glad to have
seen them all again, though a tinge of sadness mixed itself with her
pleasure. When school was over for the day, it was yet early in the
summer afternoon; and Mrs. Hepworth proposed to Margaret that she and
Mr. Bell should accompany her to the parsonage, and see the--the word
'improvements' had half slipped out of her mouth, but she substituted
the more cautious term 'alterations' which the present Vicar was making.
Margaret did not care a straw about seeing the alterations, which jarred
upon her fond recollection of what her home had been; but she longed to
see the old place once more, even though she shivered away from the pain
which she knew she should feel.

The parsonage was so altered, both inside and out, that the real pain
was less than she had anticipated. It was not like the same place. The
garden, the grass-plat, formerly so daintily trim that even a stray
rose-leaf seemed like a fleck on its exquisite arrangement and
propriety, was strewed with children's things; a bag of marbles here, a
hoop there; a straw-hat forced down upon a rose-tree as on a peg, to the
destruction of a long beautiful tender branch laden with flowers, which
in former days would have been trained up tenderly, as if beloved. The
little square matted hall was equally filled with signs of merry healthy
rough childhood.

'Ah!' said Mrs. Hepworth, 'you must excuse this untidiness, Miss Hale.
When the nursery is finished, I shall insist upon a little order. We are
building a nursery out of your room, I believe. How did you manage, Miss
Hale, without a nursery?'

'We were but two,' said Margaret. 'You have many children, I presume?'

'Seven. Look here! we are throwing out a window to the road on this
side. Mr. Hepworth is spending an immense deal of money on this house;
but really it was scarcely habitable when we came--for so large a family
as ours I mean, of course.' Every room in the house was changed, besides
the one of which Mrs. Hepworth spoke, which had been Mr. Hale's study
formerly; and where the green gloom and delicious quiet of the place had
conduced, as he had said, to a habit of meditation, but, perhaps, in
some degree to the formation of a character more fitted for thought than
action. The new window gave a view of the road, and had many advantages,
as Mrs. Hepworth pointed out. From it the wandering sheep of her
husband's flock might be seen, who straggled to the tempting beer-house,
unobserved as they might hope, but not unobserved in reality; for the
active Vicar kept his eye on the road, even during the composition of
his most orthodox sermons, and had a hat and stick hanging ready at hand
to seize, before sallying out after his parishioners, who had need of
quick legs if they could take refuge in the 'Jolly Forester' before the
teetotal Vicar had arrested them. The whole family were quick, brisk,
loud-talking, kind-hearted, and not troubled with much delicacy of
perception. Margaret feared that Mrs. Hepworth would find out that Mr.
Bell was playing upon her, in the admiration he thought fit to express
for everything that especially grated on his taste. But no! she took it
all literally, and with such good faith, that Margaret could not help
remonstrating with him as they walked slowly away from the parsonage
back to their inn.

'Don't scold, Margaret. It was all because of you. If she had not shown
you every change with such evident exultation in their superior sense,
in perceiving what an improvement this and that would be, I could have
behaved well. But if you must go on preaching, keep it till after
dinner, when it will send me to sleep, and help my digestion.'

They were both of them tired, and Margaret herself so much so, that she
was unwilling to go out as she had proposed to do, and have another
ramble among the woods and fields so close to the home of her childhood.
And, somehow, this visit to Helstone had not been all--had not been
exactly what she had expected. There was change everywhere; slight, yet
pervading all. Households were changed by absence, or death, or
marriage, or the natural mutations brought by days and months and years,
which carry us on imperceptibly from childhood to youth, and thence
through manhood to age, whence we drop like fruit, fully ripe, into the
quiet mother earth. Places were changed--a tree gone here, a bough
there, bringing in a long ray of light where no light was before--a road
was trimmed and narrowed, and the green straggling pathway by its side
enclosed and cultivated. A great improvement it was called; but Margaret
sighed over the old picturesqueness, the old gloom, and the grassy
wayside of former days. She sate by the window on the little settle,
sadly gazing out upon the gathering shades of night, which harmonised
well with her pensive thought. Mr. Bell slept soundly, after his unusual
exercise through the day. At last he was roused by the entrance of the
tea-tray, brought in by a flushed-looking country-girl, who had
evidently been finding some variety from her usual occupation of waiter,
in assisting this day in the hayfield.

'Hallo! Who's there! Where are we? Who's that,--Margaret? Oh, now I
remember all. I could not imagine what woman was sitting there in such a
doleful attitude, with her hands clasped straight out upon her knees,
and her face looking so steadfastly before her. What were you looking
at?' asked Mr. Bell, coming to the window, and standing behind Margaret.

'Nothing,' said she, rising up quickly, and speaking as cheerfully as
she could at a moment's notice.

'Nothing indeed! A bleak back-ground of trees, some white linen hung out
on the sweet-briar hedge, and a great waft of damp air. Shut the window,
and come in and make tea.'

Margaret was silent for some time. She played with her teaspoon, and did
not attend particularly to what Mr. Bell said. He contradicted her, and
she took the same sort of smiling notice of his opinion as if he had
agreed with her. Then she sighed, and putting down her spoon, she began,
apropos of nothing at all, and in the high-pitched voice which usually
shows that the speaker has been thinking for some time on the subject
that they wish to introduce--'Mr. Bell, you remember what we were saying
about Frederick last night, don't you?'

'Last night. Where was I? Oh, I remember! Why it seems a week ago. Yes,
to be sure, I recollect we talked about him, poor fellow.'

'Yes--and do you not remember that Mr. Lennox spoke about his having
been in England about the time of dear mamma's death?' asked Margaret,
her voice now lower than usual.

'I recollect. I hadn't heard of it before.'

'And I thought--I always thought that papa had told you about it.'

'No! he never did. But what about it, Margaret?'

'I want to tell you of something I did that was very wrong, about that
time,' said Margaret, suddenly looking up at him with her clear honest
eyes. 'I told a lie;' and her face became scarlet.

'True, that was bad I own; not but what I have told a pretty round
number in my life, not all in downright words, as I suppose you did, but
in actions, or in some shabby circumlocutory way, leading people either
to disbelieve the truth, or believe a falsehood. You know who is the
father of lies, Margaret? Well! a great number of folk, thinking
themselves very good, have odd sorts of connexion with lies, left-hand
marriages, and second cousins-once-removed. The tainting blood of
falsehood runs through us all. I should have guessed you as far from it
as most people. What! crying, child? Nay, now we'll not talk of it, if
it ends in this way. I dare say you have been sorry for it, and that you
won't do it again, and it's long ago now, and in short I want you to be
very cheerful, and not very sad, this evening.'

Margaret wiped her eyes, and tried to talk about something else, but
suddenly she burst out afresh.

'Please, Mr. Bell, let me tell you about it--you could perhaps help me a
little; no, not help me, but if you knew the truth, perhaps you could
put me to rights--that is not it, after all,' said she, in despair at
not being able to express herself more exactly as she wished.

Mr. Bell's whole manner changed. 'Tell me all about it, child,' said he.

'It's a long story; but when Fred came, mamma was very ill, and I was
undone with anxiety, and afraid, too, that I might have drawn him into
danger; and we had an alarm just after her death, for Dixon met some one
in Milton--a man called Leonards--who had known Fred, and who seemed to
owe him a grudge, or at any rate to be tempted by the recollection of
the reward offered for his apprehension; and with this new fright, I
thought I had better hurry off Fred to London, where, as you would
understand from what we said the other night, he was to go to consult
Mr. Lennox as to his chances if he stood the trial. So we--that is, he
and I,--went to the railway station; it was one evening, and it was just
getting rather dusk, but still light enough to recognise and be
recognised, and we were too early, and went out to walk in a field just
close by; I was always in a panic about this Leonards, who was, I knew,
somewhere in the neighbourhood; and then, when we were in the field, the
low red sunlight just in my face, some one came by on horseback in the
road just below the field-style by which we stood. I saw him look at me,
but I did not know who it was at first, the sun was so in my eyes, but
in an instant the dazzle went off, and I saw it was Mr. Thornton, and we
bowed,'----

'And he saw Frederick of course,' said Mr. Bell, helping her on with her
story, as he thought.

'Yes; and then at the station a man came up--tipsy and reeling--and he
tried to collar Fred, and over-balanced himself as Fred wrenched himself
away, and fell over the edge of the platform; not far, not deep; not
above three feet; but oh! Mr. Bell, somehow that fall killed him!'

'How awkward. It was this Leonards, I suppose. And how did Fred get
off?'

'Oh! he went off immediately after the fall, which we never thought
could have done the poor fellow any harm, it seemed so slight an
injury.'

'Then he did not die directly?'

'No! not for two or three days. And then--oh, Mr. Bell! now comes the
bad part,' said she, nervously twining her fingers together. 'A police
inspector came and taxed me with having been the companion of the young
man, whose push or blow had occasioned Leonards' death; that was a false
accusation, you know, but we had not heard that Fred had sailed, he
might still be in London and liable to be arrested on this false charge,
and his identity with the Lieutenant Hale, accused of causing that
mutiny, discovered, he might be shot; all this flashed through my mind,
and I said it was not me. I was not at the railway station that night. I
knew nothing about it. I had no conscience or thought but to save
Frederick.'

'I say it was right. I should have done the same. You forgot yourself in
thought for another. I hope I should have done the same.'

'No, you would not. It was wrong, disobedient, faithless. At that very
time Fred was safely out of England, and in my blindness I forgot that
there was another witness who could testify to my being there.'

'Who?'

'Mr. Thornton. You know he had seen me close to the station; we had
bowed to each other.'

'Well! he would know nothing of this riot about the drunken fellow's
death. I suppose the inquiry never came to anything.'

'No! the proceedings they had begun to talk about on the inquest were
stopped. Mr. Thornton did know all about it. He was a magistrate, and he
found out that it was not the fall that had caused the death. But not
before he knew what I had said. Oh, Mr. Bell!' She suddenly covered her
face with her hands, as if wishing to hide herself from the presence of
the recollection.

'Did you have any explanation with him? Did you ever tell him the
strong, instinctive motive?'

'The instinctive want of faith, and clutching at a sin to keep myself
from sinking,' said she bitterly. 'No! How could I? He knew nothing of
Frederick. To put myself to rights in his good opinion, was I to tell
him of the secrets of our family, involving, as they seemed to do, the
chances of poor Frederick's entire exculpation? Fred's last words had
been to enjoin me to keep his visit a secret from all. You see, papa
never told, even you. No! I could bear the shame--I thought I could at
least. I did bear it. Mr. Thornton has never respected me since.'

'He respects you, I am sure,' said Mr. Bell. 'To be sure, it accounts a
little for----. But he always speaks of you with regard and esteem,
though now I understand certain reservations in his manner.'

Margaret did not speak; did not attend to what Mr. Bell went on to say;
lost all sense of it. By-and-by she said:

'Will you tell me what you refer to about "reservations" in his manner
of speaking of me?'

'Oh! simply he has annoyed me by not joining in my praises of you. Like
an old fool, I thought that every one would have the same opinions as I
had; and he evidently could not agree with me. I was puzzled at the
time. But he must be perplexed, if the affair has never been in the
least explained. There was first your walking out with a young man in
the dark--'

'But it was my brother!' said Margaret, surprised.

'True. But how was he to know that?'

'I don't know. I never thought of anything of that kind,' said Margaret,
reddening, and looking hurt and offended.

'And perhaps he never would, but for the lie,--which, under the
circumstances, I maintain, was necessary.'

'It was not. I know it now. I bitterly repent it.'

There was a long pause of silence. Margaret was the first to speak.

'I am not likely ever to see Mr. Thornton again,'--and there she
stopped.

'There are many things more unlikely, I should say,' replied Mr. Bell.

'But I believe I never shall. Still, somehow one does not like to have
sunk so low in--in a friend's opinion as I have done in his.' Her eyes
were full of tears, but her voice was steady, and Mr. Bell was not
looking at her. 'And now that Frederick has given up all hope, and
almost all wish of ever clearing himself, and returning to England, it
would be only doing myself justice to have all this explained. If you
please, and if you can, if there is a good opportunity, (don't force an
explanation upon him, pray,) but if you can, will you tell him the whole
circumstances, and tell him also that I gave you leave to do so, because
I felt that for papa's sake I should not like to lose his respect,
though we may never be likely to meet again?'

'Certainly. I think he ought to know. I do not like you to rest even
under the shadow of an impropriety; he would not know what to think of
seeing you alone with a young man.'

'As for that,' said Margaret, rather haughtily, 'I hold it is "Honi soit
qui mal y pense." Yet still I should choose to have it explained, if any
natural opportunity for easy explanation occurs. But it is not to clear
myself of any suspicion of improper conduct that I wish to have him
told--if I thought that he had suspected me, I should not care for his
good opinion--no! it is that he may learn how I was tempted, and how I
fell into the snare; why I told that falsehood, in short.'

'Which I don't blame you for. It is no partiality of mine, I assure
you.'

'What other people may think of the rightness or wrongness is nothing in
comparison to my own deep knowledge, my innate conviction that it was
wrong. But we will not talk of that any more, if you please. It is
done--my sin is sinned. I have now to put it behind me, and be truthful
for evermore, if I can.'

'Very well. If you like to be uncomfortable and morbid, be so. I always
keep my conscience as tight shut up as a jack-in-a-box, for when it
jumps into existence it surprises me by its size. So I coax it down
again, as the fisherman coaxed the genie. "Wonderful," say I, "to think
that you have been concealed so long, and in so small a compass, that I
really did not know of your existence. Pray, sir, instead of growing
larger and larger every instant, and bewildering me with your misty
outlines, would you once more compress yourself into your former
dimensions?" And when I've got him down, don't I clap the seal on the
vase, and take good care how I open it again, and how I go against
Solomon, wisest of men, who confined him there.'

But it was no smiling matter to Margaret. She hardly attended to what
Mr. Bell was saying. Her thoughts ran upon the idea, before entertained,
but which now had assumed the strength of a conviction, that Mr.
Thornton no longer held his former good opinion of her--that he was
disappointed in her. She did not feel as if any explanation could ever
reinstate her--not in his love, for that and any return on her part she
had resolved never to dwell upon, and she kept rigidly to her
resolution--but in the respect and high regard which she had hoped would
have ever made him willing, in the spirit of Gerald Griffin's beautiful
lines,

    'To turn and look back when thou hearest
     The sound of my name.'

She kept choking and swallowing all the time that she thought about it.
She tried to comfort herself with the idea, that what he imagined her to
be, did not alter the fact of what she was. But it was a truism, a
phantom, and broke down under the weight of her regret. She had twenty
questions on the tip of her tongue to ask Mr. Bell, but not one of them
did she utter. Mr. Bell thought that she was tired, and sent her early
to her room, where she sate long hours by the open window, gazing out on
the purple dome above, where the stars arose, and twinkled and
disappeared behind the great umbrageous trees before she went to bed.
All night long too, there burnt a little light on earth; a candle in her
old bedroom, which was the nursery with the present inhabitants of the
parsonage, until the new one was built. A sense of change, of individual
nothingness, of perplexity and disappointment, over-powered Margaret.
Nothing had been the same; and this slight, all-pervading instability,
had given her greater pain than if all had been too entirely changed for
her to recognise it.

'I begin to understand now what heaven must be--and, oh! the grandeur
and repose of the words--"The same yesterday, to-day, and for ever."
Everlasting! "From everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God." That sky
above me looks as though it could not change, and yet it will. I am so
tired--so tired of being whirled on through all these phases of my life,
in which nothing abides by me, no creature, no place; it is like the
circle in which the victims of earthly passion eddy continually. I am in
the mood in which women of another religion take the veil. I seek
heavenly steadfastness in earthly monotony. If I were a Roman Catholic
and could deaden my heart, stun it with some great blow, I might become
a nun. But I should pine after my kind; no, not my kind, for love for my
species could never fill my heart to the utter exclusion of love for
individuals. Perhaps it ought to be so, perhaps not; I cannot decide
to-night.'

Wearily she went to bed, wearily she arose in four or five hours' time.
But with the morning came hope, and a brighter view of things.

'After all it is right,' said she, hearing the voices of children at
play while she was dressing. 'If the world stood still, it would
retrograde and become corrupt, if that is not Irish. Looking out of
myself, and my own painful sense of change, the progress all around me
is right and necessary. I must not think so much of how circumstances
affect me myself, but how they affect others, if I wish to have a right
judgment, or a hopeful trustful heart.' And with a smile ready in her
eyes to quiver down to her lips, she went into the parlour and greeted
Mr. Bell.

'Ah, Missy! you were up late last night, and so you're late this
morning. Now I've got a little piece of news for you. What do you think
of an invitation to dinner? a morning call, literally in the dewy
morning. Why, I've had the Vicar here already, on his way to the school.
How much the desire of giving our hostess a teetotal lecture for the
benefit of the haymakers, had to do with his earliness, I don't know;
but here he was, when I came down just before nine; and we are asked to
dine there to-day.'

'But Edith expects me back--I cannot go,' said Margaret, thankful to
have so good an excuse.

'Yes! I know; so I told him. I thought you would not want to go. Still
it is open, if you would like it.'

'Oh, no!' said Margaret. 'Let us keep to our plan. Let us start at
twelve. It is very good and kind of them; but indeed I could not go.'

'Very well. Don't fidget yourself, and I'll arrange it all.'

Before they left Margaret stole round to the back of the Vicarage
garden, and gathered a little straggling piece of honeysuckle. She would
not take a flower the day before, for fear of being observed, and her
motives and feelings commented upon. But as she returned across the
common, the place was reinvested with the old enchanting atmosphere. The
common sounds of life were more musical there than anywhere else in the
whole world, the light more golden, the life more tranquil and full of
dreamy delight. As Margaret remembered her feelings yesterday, she said
to herself:

'And I too change perpetually--now this, now that--now disappointed and
peevish because all is not exactly as I had pictured it, and now
suddenly discovering that the reality is far more beautiful than I had
imagined it. Oh, Helstone! I shall never love any place like you.

A few days afterwards, she had found her level, and decided that she was
very glad to have been there, and that she had seen it again, and that
to her it would always be the prettiest spot in the world, but that it
was so full of associations with former days, and especially with her
father and mother, that if it were all to come over again, she should
shrink back from such another visit as that which she had paid with Mr.
Bell.




CHAPTER XLVII

SOMETHING WANTING

    'Experience, like a pale musician, holds
     A dulcimer of patience in his hand;
     Whence harmonies we cannot understand,
     Of God's will in His worlds, the strain unfolds
     In sad, perplexed minors.'
              MRS. BROWNING.


About this time Dixon returned from Milton, and assumed her post as
Margaret's maid. She brought endless pieces of Milton gossip: How Martha
had gone to live with Miss Thornton, on the latter's marriage; with an
account of the bridesmaids, dresses and breakfasts, at that interesting
ceremony; how people thought that Mr. Thornton had made too grand a
wedding of it, considering he had lost a deal by the strike, and had had
to pay so much for the failure of his contracts; how little money
articles of furniture--long cherished by Dixon--had fetched at the sale,
which was a shame considering how rich folks were at Milton; how Mrs.
Thornton had come one day and got two or three good bargains, and Mr.
Thornton had come the next, and in his desire to obtain one or two
things, had bid against himself, much to the enjoyment of the
bystanders, so as Dixon observed, that made things even; if Mrs.
Thornton paid too little, Mr. Thornton paid too much. Mr. Bell had sent
all sorts of orders about the books; there was no understanding him, he
was so particular; if he had come himself it would have been all right,
but letters always were and always will be more puzzling than they are
worth. Dixon had not much to tell about the Higginses. Her memory had an
aristocratic bias, and was very treacherous whenever she tried to recall
any circumstance connected with those below her in life. Nicholas was
very well she believed. He had been several times at the house asking
for news of Miss Margaret--the only person who ever did ask, except once
Mr. Thornton. And Mary? oh! of course she was very well, a great, stout,
slatternly thing! She did hear, or perhaps it was only a dream of hers,
though it would be strange if she had dreamt of such people as the
Higginses, that Mary had gone to work at Mr. Thornton's mill, because
her father wished her to know how to cook; but what nonsense that could
mean she didn't know. Margaret rather agreed with her that the story was
incoherent enough to be like a dream. Still it was pleasant to have some
one now with whom she could talk of Milton, and Milton people. Dixon was
not over-fond of the subject, rather wishing to leave that part of her
life in shadow. She liked much more to dwell upon speeches of Mr.
Bell's, which had suggested an idea to her of what was really his
intention--making Margaret his heiress. But her young lady gave her no
encouragement, nor in any way gratified her insinuating enquiries,
however disguised in the form of suspicions or assertions.

All this time, Margaret had a strange undefined longing to hear that Mr.
Bell had gone to pay one of his business visits to Milton; for it had
been well understood between them, at the time of their conversation at
Helstone, that the explanation she had desired should only be given to
Mr. Thornton by word of mouth, and even in that manner should be in
nowise forced upon him. Mr. Bell was no great correspondent, but he
wrote from time to time long or short letters, as the humour took him,
and although Margaret was not conscious of any definite hope, on
receiving them, yet she always put away his notes with a little feeling
of disappointment. He was not going to Milton; he said nothing about it
at any rate. Well! she must be patient. Sooner or later the mists would
be cleared away. Mr. Bell's letters were hardly like his usual self;
they were short, and complaining, with every now and then a little touch
of bitterness that was unusual. He did not look forward to the future;
he rather seemed to regret the past, and be weary of the present.
Margaret fancied that he could not be well; but in answer to some
enquiry of hers as to his health, he sent her a short note, saying there
was an old-fashioned complaint called the spleen; that he was suffering
from that, and it was for her to decide if it was more mental or
physical; but that he should like to indulge himself in grumbling,
without being obliged to send a bulletin every time.

In consequence of this note, Margaret made no more enquiries about his
health. One day Edith let out accidentally a fragment of a conversation
which she had had with Mr. Bell, when he was last in London, which
possessed Margaret with the idea that he had some notion of taking her
to pay a visit to her brother and new sister-in-law, at Cadiz, in the
autumn. She questioned and cross-questioned Edith, till the latter was
weary, and declared that there was nothing more to remember; all he had
said was that he half-thought he should go, and hear for himself what
Frederick had to say about the mutiny; and that it would be a good
opportunity for Margaret to become acquainted with her new
sister-in-law; that he always went somewhere during the long vacation,
and did not see why he should not go to Spain as well as anywhere else.
That was all. Edith hoped Margaret did not want to leave them, that she
was so anxious about all this. And then, having nothing else particular
to do, she cried, and said that she knew she cared much more for
Margaret than Margaret did for her. Margaret comforted her as well as
she could, but she could hardly explain to her how this idea of Spain,
mere chateau en Espagne as it might be, charmed and delighted her. Edith
was in the mood to think that any pleasure enjoyed away from her was a
tacit affront, or at best a proof of indifference. So Margaret had to
keep her pleasure to herself, and could only let it escape by the
safety-valve of asking Dixon, when she dressed for dinner, if she would
not like to see Master Frederick and his new wife very much indeed?

'She's a Papist, Miss, isn't she?'

'I believe--oh yes, certainly!' said Margaret, a little damped for an
instant at this recollection.

'And they live in a Popish country?'

'Yes.'

'Then I'm afraid I must say, that my soul is dearer to me than even
Master Frederick, his own dear self. I should be in a perpetual terror,
Miss, lest I should be converted.'

'Oh' said Margaret, 'I do not know that I am going; and if I go, I am
not such a fine lady as to be unable to travel without you. No! dear old
Dixon, you shall have a long holiday, if we go. But I'm afraid it is a
long "if."'

Now Dixon did not like this speech. In the first place, she did not like
Margaret's trick of calling her 'dear old Dixon' whenever she was
particularly demonstrative. She knew that Miss Hale was apt to call all
people that she liked 'old,' as a sort of term of endearment; but Dixon
always winced away from the application of the word to herself, who,
being not much past fifty, was, she thought, in the very prime of life.
Secondly, she did not like being so easily taken at her word; she had,
with all her terror, a lurking curiosity about Spain, the Inquisition,
and Popish mysteries. So, after clearing her throat, as if to show her
willingness to do away with difficulties, she asked Miss Hale, whether
she thought if she took care never to see a priest, or enter into one of
their churches, there would be so very much danger of her being
converted? Master Frederick, to be sure, had gone over unaccountable.

'I fancy it was love that first predisposed him to conversion,' said
Margaret, sighing.

'Indeed, Miss!' said Dixon; 'well! I can preserve myself from priests,
and from churches; but love steals in unawares! I think it's as well I
should not go.'

Margaret was afraid of letting her mind run too much upon this Spanish
plan. But it took off her thoughts from too impatiently dwelling upon
her desire to have all explained to Mr. Thornton. Mr. Bell appeared for
the present to be stationary at Oxford, and to have no immediate purpose
of going to Milton, and some secret restraint seemed to hang over
Margaret, and prevent her from even asking, or alluding again to any
probability of such a visit on his part. Nor did she feel at liberty to
name what Edith had told her of the idea he had entertained,--it might
be but for five minutes,--of going to Spain. He had never named it at
Helstone, during all that sunny day of leisure; it was very probably but
the fancy of a moment,--but if it were true, what a bright outlet it
would be from the monotony of her present life, which was beginning to
fall upon her.

One of the great pleasures of Margaret's life at this time, was in
Edith's boy. He was the pride and plaything of both father and mother,
as long as he was good; but he had a strong will of his own, and as soon
as he burst out into one of his stormy passions, Edith would throw
herself back in despair and fatigue, and sigh out, 'Oh dear, what shall
I do with him! Do, Margaret, please ring the bell for Hanley.'

But Margaret almost liked him better in these manifestations of
character than in his good blue-sashed moods. She would carry him off
into a room, where they two alone battled it out; she with a firm power
which subdued him into peace, while every sudden charm and wile she
possessed, was exerted on the side of right, until he would rub his
little hot and tear-smeared face all over hers, kissing and caressing
till he often fell asleep in her arms or on her shoulder. Those were
Margaret's sweetest moments. They gave her a taste of the feeling that
she believed would be denied to her for ever.

Mr. Henry Lennox added a new and not disagreeable element to the course
of the household life by his frequent presence. Margaret thought him
colder, if more brilliant than formerly; but there were strong
intellectual tastes, and much and varied knowledge, which gave flavour
to the otherwise rather insipid conversation. Margaret saw glimpses in
him of a slight contempt for his brother and sister-in-law, and for
their mode of life, which he seemed to consider as frivolous and
purposeless. He once or twice spoke to his brother, in Margaret's
presence, in a pretty sharp tone of enquiry, as to whether he meant
entirely to relinquish his profession; and on Captain Lennox's reply,
that he had quite enough to live upon, she had seen Mr. Lennox's curl of
the lip as he said, 'And is that all you live for?'

But the brothers were much attached to each other, in the way that any
two persons are, when the one is cleverer and always leads the other,
and this last is patiently content to be led. Mr. Lennox was pushing on
in his profession; cultivating, with profound calculation, all those
connections that might eventually be of service to him; keen-sighted,
far-seeing, intelligent, sarcastic, and proud. Since the one long
conversation relating to Frederick's affairs, which she had with him the
first evening in Mr. Bell's presence, she had had no great intercourse
with him, further than that which arose out of their close relations
with the same household. But this was enough to wear off the shyness on
her side, and any symptoms of mortified pride and vanity on his. They
met continually, of course, but she thought that he rather avoided being
alone with her; she fancied that he, as well as she, perceived that they
had drifted strangely apart from their former anchorage, side by side,
in many of their opinions, and all their tastes.

And yet, when he had spoken unusually well, or with remarkable
epigrammatic point, she felt that his eye sought the expression of her
countenance first of all, if but for an instant; and that, in the family
intercourse which constantly threw them together, her opinion was the
one to which he listened with a deference,--the more complete, because
it was reluctantly paid, and concealed as much as possible.




CHAPTER XLVIII

'NE'ER TO BE FOUND AGAIN'

    'My own, my father's friend!
     I cannot part with thee!
     I ne'er have shown, thou ne'er hast known,
     How dear thou art to me.'
              ANON.


The elements of the dinner-parties which Mrs. Lennox gave, were these;
her friends contributed the beauty, Captain Lennox the easy knowledge of
the subjects of the day; and Mr. Henry Lennox and the sprinkling of
rising men who were received as his friends, brought the wit, the
cleverness, the keen and extensive knowledge of which they knew well
enough how to avail themselves without seeming pedantic, or burdening
the rapid flow of conversation.

These dinners were delightful; but even here Margaret's dissatisfaction
found her out. Every talent, every feeling, every acquirement; nay, even
every tendency towards virtue was used up as materials for fireworks;
the hidden, sacred fire, exhausted itself in sparkle and crackle. They
talked about art in a merely sensuous way, dwelling on outside effects,
instead of allowing themselves to learn what it has to teach. They
lashed themselves up into an enthusiasm about high subjects in company,
and never thought about them when they were alone; they squandered their
capabilities of appreciation into a mere flow of appropriate words. One
day, after the gentlemen had come up into the drawing-room, Mr. Lennox
drew near to Margaret, and addressed her in almost the first voluntary
words he had spoken to her since she had returned to live in Harley
Street.

'You did not look pleased at what Shirley was saying at dinner.'

'Didn't I? My face must be very expressive,' replied Margaret.

'It always was. It has not lost the trick of being eloquent.'

'I did not like,' said Margaret, hastily, 'his way of advocating what he
knew to be wrong--so glaringly wrong--even in jest.'

'But it was very clever. How every word told! Do you remember the happy
epithets?'

'Yes.'

'And despise them, you would like to add. Pray don't scruple, though he
is my friend.'

'There! that is the exact tone in you, that--' she stopped short.

He listened for a moment to see if she would finish her sentence; but
she only reddened, and turned away; before she did so, however, she
heard him say, in a very low, clear voice,--

'If my tones, or modes of thought, are what you dislike, will you do me
the justice to tell me so, and so give me the chance of learning to
please you?'

All these weeks there was no intelligence of Mr. Bell's going to Milton.
He had spoken of it at Helstone as of a journey which he might have to
take in a very short time from then; but he must have transacted his
business by writing, Margaret thought, ere now, and she knew that if he
could, he would avoid going to a place which he disliked, and moreover
would little understand the secret importance which she affixed to the
explanation that could only be given by word of mouth. She knew that he
would feel that it was necessary that it should be done; but whether in
summer, autumn, or winter, it would signify very little. It was now
August, and there had been no mention of the Spanish journey to which he
had alluded to Edith, and Margaret tried to reconcile herself to the
fading away of this illusion.

But one morning she received a letter, saying that next week he meant to
come up to town; he wanted to see her about a plan which he had in his
head; and, moreover, he intended to treat himself to a little doctoring,
as he had begun to come round to her opinion, that it would be
pleasanter to think that his health was more in fault than he, when he
found himself irritable and cross. There was altogether a tone of forced
cheerfulness in the letter, as Margaret noticed afterwards; but at the
time her attention was taken up by Edith's exclamations.

'Coming up to town! Oh dear! and I am so worn out by the heat that I
don't believe I have strength enough in me for another dinner. Besides,
everybody has left but our dear stupid selves, who can't settle where to
go to. There would be nobody to meet him.'

'I'm sure he would much rather come and dine with us quite alone than
with the most agreeable strangers you could pick up. Besides, if he is
not well he won't wish for invitations. I am glad he has owned it at
last. I was sure he was ill from the whole tone of his letters, and yet
he would not answer me when I asked him, and I had no third person to
whom I could apply for news.'

'Oh! he is not very ill, or he would not think of Spain.'

'He never mentions Spain.'

'No! but his plan that is to be proposed evidently relates to that. But
would you really go in such weather as this?'

'Oh! it will get cooler every day. Yes! Think of it! I am only afraid I
have thought and wished too much--in that absorbing wilful way which is
sure to be disappointed--or else gratified, to the letter, while in the
spirit it gives no pleasure.'

'But that's superstitious, I'm sure, Margaret.'

'No, I don't think it is. Only it ought to warn me, and check me from
giving way to such passionate wishes. It is a sort of "Give me children,
or else I die." I'm afraid my cry is, "Let me go to Cadiz, or else I
die."'

'My dear Margaret! You'll be persuaded to stay there; and then what
shall I do? Oh! I wish I could find somebody for you to marry here, that
I could be sure of you!'

'I shall never marry.'

'Nonsense, and double nonsense! Why, as Sholto says, you're such an
attraction to the house, that he knows ever so many men who will be glad
to visit here next year for your sake.'

Margaret drew herself up haughtily. 'Do you know, Edith, I sometimes
think your Corfu life has taught you---- '

'Well!'

'Just a shade or two of coarseness.'

Edith began to sob so bitterly, and to declare so vehemently that
Margaret had lost all love for her, and no longer looked upon her as a
friend, that Margaret came to think that she had expressed too harsh an
opinion for the relief of her own wounded pride, and ended by being
Edith's slave for the rest of the day; while that little lady, overcome
by wounded feeling, lay like a victim on the sofa, heaving occasionally
a profound sigh, till at last she fell asleep.

Mr. Bell did not make his appearance even on the day to which he had for
a second time deferred his visit. The next morning there came a letter
from Wallis, his servant, stating that his master had not been feeling
well for some time, which had been the true reason of his putting off
his journey; and that at the very time when he should have set out for
London, he had been seized with an apoplectic fit; it was, indeed,
Wallis added, the opinion of the medical men--that he could not survive
the night; and more than probable, that by the time Miss Hale received
this letter his poor master would be no more.

Margaret received this letter at breakfast-time, and turned very pale as
she read it; then silently putting it into Edith's hands, she left the
room.

Edith was terribly shocked as she read it, and cried in a sobbing,
frightened, childish way, much to her husband's distress. Mrs. Shaw was
breakfasting in her own room, and upon him devolved the task of
reconciling his wife to the near contact into which she seemed to be
brought with death, for the first time that she could remember in her
life. Here was a man who was to have dined with them to-day lying dead
or dying instead! It was some time before she could think of Margaret.
Then she started up, and followed her upstairs into her room. Dixon was
packing up a few toilette articles, and Margaret was hastily putting on
her bonnet, shedding tears all the time, and her hands trembling so that
she could hardly tie the strings.

'Oh, dear Margaret! how shocking! What are you doing? Are you going out?
Sholto would telegraph or do anything you like.'

'I am going to Oxford. There is a train in half-an-hour. Dixon has
offered to go with me, but I could have gone by myself. I must see him
again. Besides, he may be better, and want some care. He has been like a
father to me. Don't stop me, Edith.'

'But I must. Mamma won't like it at all. Come and ask her about it,
Margaret. You don't know where you're going. I should not mind if he had
a house of his own; but in his Fellow's rooms! Come to mamma, and do ask
her before you go. It will not take a minute.'

Margaret yielded, and lost her train. In the suddenness of the event,
Mrs. Shaw became bewildered and hysterical, and so the precious time
slipped by. But there was another train in a couple of hours; and after
various discussions on propriety and impropriety, it was decided that
Captain Lennox should accompany Margaret, as the one thing to which she
was constant was her resolution to go, alone or otherwise, by the next
train, whatever might be said of the propriety or impropriety of the
step. Her father's friend, her own friend, was lying at the point of
death; and the thought of this came upon her with such vividness, that
she was surprised herself at the firmness with which she asserted
something of her right to independence of action; and five minutes
before the time for starting, she found herself sitting in a
railway-carriage opposite to Captain Lennox.

It was always a comfort to her to think that she had gone, though it was
only to hear that he had died in the night. She saw the rooms that he
had occupied, and associated them ever after most fondly in her memory
with the idea of her father, and his one cherished and faithful friend.

They had promised Edith before starting, that if all had ended as they
feared, they would return to dinner; so that long, lingering look around
the room in which her father had died, had to be interrupted, and a
quiet farewell taken of the kind old face that had so often come out
with pleasant words, and merry quips and cranks.

Captain Lennox fell asleep on their journey home; and Margaret could cry
at leisure, and bethink her of this fatal year, and all the woes it had
brought to her. No sooner was she fully aware of one loss than another
came--not to supersede her grief for the one before, but to re-open
wounds and feelings scarcely healed. But at the sound of the tender
voices of her aunt and Edith, of merry little Sholto's glee at her
arrival, and at the sight of the well-lighted rooms, with their mistress
pretty in her paleness and her eager sorrowful interest, Margaret roused
herself from her heavy trance of almost superstitious hopelessness, and
began to feel that even around her joy and gladness might gather. She
had Edith's place on the sofa; Sholto was taught to carry aunt
Margaret's cup of tea very carefully to her; and by the time she went up
to dress, she could thank God for having spared her dear old friend a
long or a painful illness.

But when night came--solemn night, and all the house was quiet, Margaret
still sate watching the beauty of a London sky at such an hour, on such
a summer evening; the faint pink reflection of earthly lights on the
soft clouds that float tranquilly into the white moonlight, out of the
warm gloom which lies motionless around the horizon. Margaret's room had
been the day nursery of her childhood, just when it merged into
girlhood, and when the feelings and conscience had been first awakened
into full activity. On some such night as this she remembered promising
to herself to live as brave and noble a life as any heroine she ever
read or heard of in romance, a life sans peur et sans reproche; it had
seemed to her then that she had only to will, and such a life would be
accomplished. And now she had learnt that not only to will, but also to
pray, was a necessary condition in the truly heroic. Trusting to
herself, she had fallen. It was a just consequence of her sin, that all
excuses for it, all temptation to it, should remain for ever unknown to
the person in whose opinion it had sunk her lowest. She stood face to
face at last with her sin. She knew it for what it was; Mr. Bell's
kindly sophistry that nearly all men were guilty of equivocal actions,
and that the motive ennobled the evil, had never had much real weight
with her. Her own first thought of how, if she had known all, she might
have fearlessly told the truth, seemed low and poor. Nay, even now, her
anxiety to have her character for truth partially excused in Mr.
Thornton's eyes, as Mr. Bell had promised to do, was a very small and
petty consideration, now that she was afresh taught by death what life
should be. If all the world spoke, acted, or kept silence with intent to
deceive,--if dearest interests were at stake, and dearest lives in
peril,--if no one should ever know of her truth or her falsehood to
measure out their honour or contempt for her by, straight alone where
she stood, in the presence of God, she prayed that she might have
strength to speak and act the truth for evermore.




CHAPTER XLIX

BREATHING TRANQUILLITY

    'And down the sunny beach she paces slowly,
     With many doubtful pauses by the way;
     Grief hath an influence so hush'd and holy.'
              HOOD.


'Is not Margaret the heiress?' whispered Edith to her husband, as they
were in their room alone at night after the sad journey to Oxford. She
had pulled his tall head down, and stood upon tiptoe, and implored him
not to be shocked, before she had ventured to ask this question. Captain
Lennox was, however, quite in the dark; if he had ever heard, he had
forgotten; it could not be much that a Fellow of a small college had to
leave; but he had never wanted her to pay for her board; and two hundred
and fifty pounds a year was something ridiculous, considering that she
did not take wine. Edith came down upon her feet a little bit sadder;
with a romance blown to pieces.

A week afterwards, she came prancing towards her husband, and made him a
low curtsey:

'I am right, and you are wrong, most noble Captain. Margaret has had a
lawyer's letter, and she is residuary legatee--the legacies being about
two thousand pounds, and the remainder about forty thousand, at the
present value of property in Milton.'

'Indeed! and how does she take her good fortune?'

'Oh, it seems she knew she was to have it all along; only she had no
idea it was so much. She looks very white and pale, and says she's
afraid of it; but that's nonsense, you know, and will soon go off. I
left mamma pouring congratulations down her throat, and stole away to
tell you.'

It seemed to be supposed, by general consent, that the most natural
thing was to consider Mr. Lennox henceforward as Margaret's legal
adviser. She was so entirely ignorant of all forms of business that in
nearly everything she had to refer to him. He chose out her attorney; he
came to her with papers to be signed. He was never so happy as when
teaching her of what all these mysteries of the law were the signs and
types.

'Henry,' said Edith, one day, archly; 'do you know what I hope and
expect all these long conversations with Margaret will end in?'

'No, I don't,' said he, reddening. 'And I desire you not to tell me.'

'Oh, very well; then I need not tell Sholto not to ask Mr. Montagu so
often to the house.'

'Just as you choose,' said he with forced coolness. 'What you are
thinking of, may or may not happen; but this time, before I commit
myself, I will see my ground clear. Ask whom you choose. It may not be
very civil, Edith, but if you meddle in it you will mar it. She has been
very farouche with me for a long time; and is only just beginning to
thaw a little from her Zenobia ways. She has the making of a Cleopatra
in her, if only she were a little more pagan.'

'For my part,' said Edith, a little maliciously, 'I am very glad she is
a Christian. I know so very few!'

There was no Spain for Margaret that autumn; although to the last she
hoped that some fortunate occasion would call Frederick to Paris,
whither she could easily have met with a convoy. Instead of Cadiz, she
had to content herself with Cromer. To that place her aunt Shaw and the
Lennoxes were bound. They had all along wished her to accompany them,
and, consequently, with their characters, they made but lazy efforts to
forward her own separate wish. Perhaps Cromer was, in one sense of the
expression, the best for her. She needed bodily strengthening and
bracing as well as rest.

Among other hopes that had vanished, was the hope, the trust she had
had, that Mr. Bell would have given Mr. Thornton the simple facts of the
family circumstances which had preceded the unfortunate accident that
led to Leonards' death. Whatever opinion--however changed it might be
from what Mr. Thornton had once entertained, she had wished it to be
based upon a true understanding of what she had done; and why she had
done it. It would have been a pleasure to her; would have given her rest
on a point on which she should now all her life be restless, unless she
could resolve not to think upon it. It was now so long after the time of
these occurrences, that there was no possible way of explaining them
save the one which she had lost by Mr. Bell's death. She must just
submit, like many another, to be misunderstood; but, though reasoning
herself into the belief that in this hers was no uncommon lot, her heart
did not ache the less with longing that some time--years and years
hence--before he died at any rate, he might know how much she had been
tempted. She thought that she did not want to hear that all was
explained to him, if only she could be sure that he would know. But this
wish was vain, like so many others; and when she had schooled herself
into this conviction, she turned with all her heart and strength to the
life that lay immediately before her, and resolved to strive and make
the best of that.

She used to sit long hours upon the beach, gazing intently on the waves
as they chafed with perpetual motion against the pebbly shore,--or she
looked out upon the more distant heave, and sparkle against the sky, and
heard, without being conscious of hearing, the eternal psalm, which went
up continually. She was soothed without knowing how or why. Listlessly
she sat there, on the ground, her hands clasped round her knees, while
her aunt Shaw did small shoppings, and Edith and Captain Lennox rode far
and wide on shore and inland. The nurses, sauntering on with their
charges, would pass and repass her, and wonder in whispers what she
could find to look at so long, day after day. And when the family
gathered at dinner-time, Margaret was so silent and absorbed that Edith
voted her moped, and hailed a proposal of her husband's with great
satisfaction, that Mr. Henry Lennox should be asked to take Cromer for a
week, on his return from Scotland in October.

But all this time for thought enabled Margaret to put events in their
right places, as to origin and significance, both as regarded her past
life and her future. Those hours by the sea-side were not lost, as any
one might have seen who had had the perception to read, or the care to
understand, the look that Margaret's face was gradually acquiring. Mr.
Henry Lennox was excessively struck by the change.

'The sea has done Miss Hale an immense deal of good, I should fancy,'
said he, when she first left the room after his arrival in their family
circle. 'She looks ten years younger than she did in Harley Street.'

'That's the bonnet I got her!' said Edith, triumphantly. 'I knew it
would suit her the moment I saw it.'

'I beg your pardon,' said Mr. Lennox, in the half-contemptuous,
half-indulgent tone he generally used to Edith. 'But I believe I know
the difference between the charms of a dress and the charms of a woman.
No mere bonnet would have made Miss Hale's eyes so lustrous and yet so
soft, or her lips so ripe and red--and her face altogether so full of
peace and light.--She is like, and yet more,'--he dropped his
voice,--'like the Margaret Hale of Helstone.'

From this time the clever and ambitious man bent all his powers to
gaining Margaret. He loved her sweet beauty. He saw the latent sweep of
her mind, which could easily (he thought) be led to embrace all the
objects on which he had set his heart. He looked upon her fortune only
as a part of the complete and superb character of herself and her
position: yet he was fully aware of the rise which it would immediately
enable him, the poor barrister, to take. Eventually he would earn such
success, and such honours, as would enable him to pay her back, with
interest, that first advance in wealth which he should owe to her. He
had been to Milton on business connected with her property, on his
return from Scotland; and with the quick eye of a skilled lawyer, ready
ever to take in and weigh contingencies, he had seen that much
additional value was yearly accruing to the lands and tenements which
she owned in that prosperous and increasing town. He was glad to find
that the present relationship between Margaret and himself, of client
and legal adviser, was gradually superseding the recollection of that
unlucky, mismanaged day at Helstone. He had thus unusual opportunities
of intimate intercourse with her, besides those that arose from the
connection between the families.

Margaret was only too willing to listen as long as he talked of Milton,
though he had seen none of the people whom she more especially knew. It
had been the tone with her aunt and cousin to speak of Milton with
dislike and contempt; just such feelings as Margaret was ashamed to
remember she had expressed and felt on first going to live there. But
Mr. Lennox almost exceeded Margaret in his appreciation of the character
of Milton and its inhabitants. Their energy, their power, their
indomitable courage in struggling and fighting; their lurid vividness of
existence, captivated and arrested his attention. He was never tired of
talking about them; and had never perceived how selfish and material
were too many of the ends they proposed to themselves as the result of
all their mighty, untiring endeavour, till Margaret, even in the midst
of her gratification, had the candour to point this out, as the tainting
sin in so much that was noble, and to be admired. Still, when other
subjects palled upon her, and she gave but short answers to many
questions, Henry Lennox found out that an enquiry as to some Darkshire
peculiarity of character, called back the light into her eye, the glow
into her cheek.

When they returned to town, Margaret fulfilled one of her sea-side
resolves, and took her life into her own hands. Before they went to
Cromer, she had been as docile to her aunt's laws as if she were still
the scared little stranger who cried herself to sleep that first night
in the Harley Street nursery. But she had learnt, in those solemn hours
of thought, that she herself must one day answer for her own life, and
what she had done with it; and she tried to settle that most difficult
problem for women, how much was to be utterly merged in obedience to
authority, and how much might be set apart for freedom in working. Mrs.
Shaw was as good-tempered as could be; and Edith had inherited this
charming domestic quality; Margaret herself had probably the worst
temper of the three, for her quick perceptions, and over-lively
imagination made her hasty, and her early isolation from sympathy had
made her proud; but she had an indescribable childlike sweetness of
heart, which made her manners, even in her rarely wilful moods,
irresistible of old; and now, chastened even by what the world called
her good fortune, she charmed her reluctant aunt into acquiescence with
her will. So Margaret gained the acknowledgment of her right to follow
her own ideas of duty.

'Only don't be strong-minded,' pleaded Edith. 'Mamma wants you to have a
footman of your own; and I'm sure you're very welcome, for they're great
plagues. Only to please me, darling, don't go and have a strong mind;
it's the only thing I ask. Footman or no footman, don't be
strong-minded.'

'Don't be afraid, Edith. I'll faint on your hands at the servants'
dinner-time, the very first opportunity; and then, what with Sholto
playing with the fire, and the baby crying, you'll begin to wish for a
strong-minded woman, equal to any emergency.'

'And you'll not grow too good to joke and be merry?'

'Not I. I shall be merrier than I have ever been, now I have got my own
way.'

'And you'll not go a figure, but let me buy your dresses for you?'

'Indeed I mean to buy them for myself. You shall come with me if you
like; but no one can please me but myself.'

'Oh! I was afraid you'd dress in brown and dust-colour, not to show the
dirt you'll pick up in all those places. I'm glad you're going to keep
one or two vanities, just by way of specimens of the old Adam.'

'I'm going to be just the same, Edith, if you and my aunt could but
fancy so. Only as I have neither husband nor child to give me natural
duties, I must make myself some, in addition to ordering my gowns.'

In the family conclave, which was made up of Edith, her mother, and her
husband, it was decided that perhaps all these plans of hers would only
secure her the more for Henry Lennox. They kept her out of the way of
other friends who might have eligible sons or brothers; and it was also
agreed that she never seemed to take much pleasure in the society of any
one but Henry, out of their own family. The other admirers, attracted by
her appearance or the reputation of her fortune, were swept away, by her
unconscious smiling disdain, into the paths frequented by other beauties
less fastidious, or other heiresses with a larger amount of gold. Henry
and she grew slowly into closer intimacy; but neither he nor she were
people to brook the slightest notice of their proceedings.




CHAPTER L

CHANGES AT MILTON

    'Here we go up, up, up;
     And here we go down, down, downee!'
              NURSERY SONG.


Meanwhile, at Milton the chimneys smoked, the ceaseless roar and mighty
beat, and dizzying whirl of machinery, struggled and strove perpetually.
Senseless and purposeless were wood and iron and steam in their endless
labours; but the persistence of their monotonous work was rivalled in
tireless endurance by the strong crowds, who, with sense and with
purpose, were busy and restless in seeking after--What? In the streets
there were few loiterers,--none walking for mere pleasure; every man's
face was set in lines of eagerness or anxiety; news was sought for with
fierce avidity; and men jostled each other aside in the Mart and in the
Exchange, as they did in life, in the deep selfishness of competition.
There was gloom over the town. Few came to buy, and those who did were
looked at suspiciously by the sellers; for credit was insecure, and the
most stable might have their fortunes affected by the sweep in the great
neighbouring port among the shipping houses. Hitherto there had been no
failures in Milton; but, from the immense speculations that had come to
light in making a bad end in America, and yet nearer home, it was known
that some Milton houses of business must suffer so severely that every
day men's faces asked, if their tongues did not, 'What news? Who is
gone? How will it affect me?' And if two or three spoke together, they
dwelt rather on the names of those who were safe than dared to hint at
those likely, in their opinion, to go; for idle breath may, at such
times, cause the downfall of some who might otherwise weather the storm;
and one going down drags many after. 'Thornton is safe,' say they. 'His
business is large--extending every year; but such a head as he has, and
so prudent with all his daring!' Then one man draws another aside, and
walks a little apart, and, with head inclined into his neighbour's ear,
he says, 'Thornton's business is large; but he has spent his profits in
extending it; he has no capital laid by; his machinery is new within
these two years, and has cost him--we won't say what!--a word to the
wise!' But that Mr. Harrison was a croaker,--a man who had succeeded to
his father's trade-made fortune, which he had feared to lose by altering
his mode of business to any having a larger scope; yet he grudged every
penny made by others more daring and far-sighted.

But the truth was, Mr. Thornton was hard pressed. He felt it acutely in
his vulnerable point--his pride in the commercial character which he had
established for himself. Architect of his own fortunes, he attributed
this to no special merit or qualities of his own, but to the power,
which he believed that commerce gave to every brave, honest, and
persevering man, to raise himself to a level from which he might see and
read the great game of worldly success, and honestly, by such
far-sightedness, command more power and influence than in any other mode
of life. Far away, in the East and in the West, where his person would
never be known, his name was to be regarded, and his wishes to be
fulfilled, and his word pass like gold. That was the idea of
merchant-life with which Mr. Thornton had started. 'Her merchants be
like princes,' said his mother, reading the text aloud, as if it were a
trumpet-call to invite her boy to the struggle. He was but like many
others--men, women, and children--alive to distant, and dead to near
things. He sought to possess the influence of a name in foreign
countries and far-away seas,--to become the head of a firm that should
be known for generations; and it had taken him long silent years to come
even to a glimmering of what he might be now, to-day, here in his own
town, his own factory, among his own people. He and they had led
parallel lives--very close, but never touching--till the accident (or so
it seemed) of his acquaintance with Higgins. Once brought face to face,
man to man, with an individual of the masses around him, and (take
notice) out of the character of master and workman, in the first
instance, they had each begun to recognise that 'we have all of us one
human heart.' It was the fine point of the wedge; and until now, when
the apprehension of losing his connection with two or three of the
workmen whom he had so lately begun to know as men,--of having a plan or
two, which were experiments lying very close to his heart, roughly
nipped off without trial,--gave a new poignancy to the subtle fear that
came over him from time to time; until now, he had never recognised how
much and how deep was the interest he had grown of late to feel in his
position as manufacturer, simply because it led him into such close
contact, and gave him the opportunity of so much power, among a race of
people strange, shrewd, ignorant; but, above all, full of character and
strong human feeling.

He reviewed his position as a Milton manufacturer. The strike a year and
a half ago,--or more, for it was now untimely wintry weather, in a late
spring,--that strike, when he was young, and he now was old--had
prevented his completing some of the large orders he had then on hand.
He had locked up a good deal of his capital in new and expensive
machinery, and he had also bought cotton largely, for the fulfilment of
these orders, taken under contract. That he had not been able to
complete them, was owing in some degree to the utter want of skill on
the part of the Irish hands whom he had imported; much of their work was
damaged and unfit to be sent forth by a house which prided itself on
turning out nothing but first-rate articles. For many months, the
embarrassment caused by the strike had been an obstacle in Mr.
Thornton's way; and often, when his eye fell on Higgins, he could have
spoken angrily to him without any present cause, just from feeling how
serious was the injury that had arisen from this affair in which he was
implicated. But when he became conscious of this sudden, quick
resentment, he resolved to curb it. It would not satisfy him to avoid
Higgins; he must convince himself that he was master over his own anger,
by being particularly careful to allow Higgins access to him, whenever
the strict rules of business, or Mr. Thornton's leisure permitted. And
by-and-bye, he lost all sense of resentment in wonder how it was, or
could be, that two men like himself and Higgins, living by the same
trade, working in their different ways at the same object, could look
upon each other's position and duties in so strangely different a way.
And thence arose that intercourse, which though it might not have the
effect of preventing all future clash of opinion and action, when the
occasion arose, would, at any rate, enable both master and man to look
upon each other with far more charity and sympathy, and bear with each
other more patiently and kindly. Besides this improvement of feeling,
both Mr. Thornton and his workmen found out their ignorance as to
positive matters of fact, known heretofore to one side, but not to the
other.

But now had come one of those periods of bad trade, when the market
falling brought down the value of all large stocks; Mr. Thornton's fell
to nearly half. No orders were coming in; so he lost the interest of the
capital he had locked up in machinery; indeed, it was difficult to get
payment for the orders completed; yet there was the constant drain of
expenses for working the business. Then the bills became due for the
cotton he had purchased; and money being scarce, he could only borrow at
exorbitant interest, and yet he could not realise any of his property.
But he did not despair; he exerted himself day and night to foresee and
to provide for all emergencies; he was as calm and gentle to the women
in his home as ever; to the workmen in his mill he spoke not many words,
but they knew him by this time; and many a curt, decided answer was
received by them rather with sympathy for the care they saw pressing
upon him, than with the suppressed antagonism which had formerly been
smouldering, and ready for hard words and hard judgments on all
occasions. 'Th' measter's a deal to potter him,' said Higgins, one day,
as he heard Mr. Thornton's short, sharp inquiry, why such a command had
not been obeyed; and caught the sound of the suppressed sigh which he
heaved in going past the room where some of the men were working.
Higgins and another man stopped over-hours that night, unknown to any
one, to get the neglected piece of work done; and Mr. Thornton never
knew but that the overlooker, to whom he had given the command in the
first instance, had done it himself.

'Eh! I reckon I know who'd ha' been sorry for to see our measter sitting
so like a piece o' grey calico! Th' ou'd parson would ha' fretted his
woman's heart out, if he'd seen the woeful looks I have seen on our
measter's face,' thought Higgins, one day, as he was approaching Mr.
Thornton in Marlborough Street.

'Measter,' said he, stopping his employer in his quick resolved walk,
and causing that gentleman to look up with a sudden annoyed start, as if
his thoughts had been far away.

'Have yo' heerd aught of Miss Marget lately?'

'Miss--who?' replied Mr. Thornton.

'Miss Marget--Miss Hale--th' oud parson's daughter--yo known who I mean
well enough, if yo'll only think a bit--' (there was nothing
disrespectful in the tone in which this was said).

'Oh yes!' and suddenly, the wintry frost-bound look of care had left Mr.
Thornton's face, as if some soft summer gale had blown all anxiety away
from his mind; and though his mouth was as much compressed as before,
his eyes smiled out benignly on his questioner.

'She's my landlord now, you know, Higgins. I hear of her through her
agent here, every now and then. She's well and among friends--thank you,
Higgins.' That 'thank you' that lingered after the other words, and yet
came with so much warmth of feeling, let in a new light to the acute
Higgins. It might be but a will-o'-th'-wisp, but he thought he would
follow it and ascertain whither it would lead him.

'And she's not getten married, measter?'

'Not yet.' The face was cloudy once more. 'There is some talk of it, as
I understand, with a connection of the family.'

'Then she'll not be for coming to Milton again, I reckon.'

'No!'

'Stop a minute, measter.' Then going up confidentially close, he said,
'Is th' young gentleman cleared?' He enforced the depth of his
intelligence by a wink of the eye, which only made things more
mysterious to Mr. Thornton.

'Th' young gentleman, I mean--Master Frederick, they ca'ad him--her
brother as was over here, yo' known.'

'Over here.'

'Ay, to be sure, at th' missus's death. Yo' need na be feared of my
telling; for Mary and me, we knowed it all along, only we held our
peace, for we got it through Mary working in th' house.'

'And he was over. It was her brother!'

'Sure enough, and I reckoned yo' knowed it or I'd never ha' let on. Yo'
knowed she had a brother?'

'Yes, I know all about him. And he was over at Mrs. Hale's death?'

'Nay! I'm not going for to tell more. I've maybe getten them into
mischief already, for they kept it very close. I nobbut wanted to know
if they'd getten him cleared?'

'Not that I know of. I know nothing. I only hear of Miss Hale, now, as
my landlord, and through her lawyer.'

He broke off from Higgins, to follow the business on which he had been
bent when the latter first accosted him; leaving Higgins baffled in his
endeavour.

'It was her brother,' said Mr. Thornton to himself. 'I am glad. I may
never see her again; but it is a comfort--a relief--to know that much. I
knew she could not be unmaidenly; and yet I yearned for conviction. Now
I am glad!'

It was a little golden thread running through the dark web of his
present fortunes; which were growing ever gloomier and more gloomy. His
agent had largely trusted a house in the American trade, which went
down, along with several others, just at this time, like a pack of
cards, the fall of one compelling other failures. What were Mr.
Thornton's engagements? Could he stand?

Night after night he took books and papers into his own private room,
and sate up there long after the family were gone to bed. He thought
that no one knew of this occupation of the hours he should have spent in
sleep. One morning, when daylight was stealing in through the crevices
of his shutters, and he had never been in bed, and, in hopeless
indifference of mind, was thinking that he could do without the hour or
two of rest, which was all that he should be able to take before the
stir of daily labour began again, the door of his room opened, and his
mother stood there, dressed as she had been the day before. She had
never laid herself down to slumber any more than he. Their eyes met.
Their faces were cold and rigid, and wan, from long watching.

'Mother! why are not you in bed?'

'Son John,' said she, 'do you think I can sleep with an easy mind, while
you keep awake full of care? You have not told me what your trouble is;
but sore trouble you have had these many days past.'

'Trade is bad.'

'And you dread--'

'I dread nothing,' replied he, drawing up his head, and holding it
erect. 'I know now that no man will suffer by me. That was my anxiety.'

'But how do you stand? Shall you--will it be a failure?' her steady
voice trembling in an unwonted manner.

'Not a failure. I must give up business, but I pay all men. I might
redeem myself--I am sorely tempted--'

'How? Oh, John! keep up your name--try all risks for that. How redeem
it?'

'By a speculation offered to me, full of risk; but, if successful,
placing me high above water-mark, so that no one need ever know the
strait I am in. Still, if it fails--'

'And if it fails,' said she, advancing, and laying her hand on his arm,
her eyes full of eager light. She held her breath to hear the end of his
speech.

'Honest men are ruined by a rogue,' said he gloomily. 'As I stand now,
my creditors, money is safe--every farthing of it; but I don't know
where to find my own--it may be all gone, and I penniless at this
moment. Therefore, it is my creditors' money that I should risk.'

'But if it succeeded, they need never know. Is it so desperate a
speculation? I am sure it is not, or you would never have thought of it.
If it succeeded--'

'I should be a rich man, and my peace of conscience would be gone!'

'Why! You would have injured no one.'

'No; but I should have run the risk of ruining many for my own paltry
aggrandisement. Mother, I have decided! You won't much grieve over our
leaving this house, shall you, dear mother?'

'No! but to have you other than what you are will break my heart. What
can you do?'

'Be always the same John Thornton in whatever circumstances;
endeavouring to do right, and making great blunders; and then trying to
be brave in setting to afresh. But it is hard, mother. I have so worked
and planned. I have discovered new powers in my situation too late--and
now all is over. I am too old to begin again with the same heart. It is
hard, mother.'

He turned away from her, and covered his face with his hands.

'I can't think,' said she, with gloomy defiance in her tone, 'how it
comes about. Here is my boy--good son, just man, tender heart--and he
fails in all he sets his mind upon: he finds a woman to love, and she
cares no more for his affection than if he had been any common man; he
labours, and his labour comes to nought. Other people prosper and grow
rich, and hold their paltry names high and dry above shame.'

'Shame never touched me,' said he, in a low tone: but she went on.

'I sometimes have wondered where justice was gone to, and now I don't
believe there is such a thing in the world,--now you are come to this;
you, my own John Thornton, though you and I may be beggars together--my
own dear son!'

She fell upon his neck, and kissed him through her tears.

'Mother!' said he, holding her gently in his arms, 'who has sent me my
lot in life, both of good and of evil?'

She shook her head. She would have nothing to do with religion just
then.

'Mother,' he went on, seeing that she would not speak, 'I, too, have
been rebellious; but I am striving to be so no longer. Help me, as you
helped me when I was a child. Then you said many good words--when my
father died, and we were sometimes sorely short of comforts--which we
shall never be now; you said brave, noble, trustful words then, mother,
which I have never forgotten, though they may have lain dormant. Speak
to me again in the old way, mother. Do not let us have to think that the
world has too much hardened our hearts. If you would say the old good
words, it would make me feel something of the pious simplicity of my
childhood. I say them to myself, but they would come differently from
you, remembering all the cares and trials you have had to bear.'

'I have had a many,' said she, sobbing, 'but none so sore as this. To
see you cast down from your rightful place! I could say it for myself,
John, but not for you. Not for you! God has seen fit to be very hard on
you, very.'

She shook with the sobs that come so convulsively when an old person
weeps. The silence around her struck her at last; and she quieted
herself to listen. No sound. She looked. Her son sate by the table, his
arms thrown half across it, his head bent face downwards.

'Oh, John!' she said, and she lifted his face up. Such a strange, pallid
look of gloom was on it, that for a moment it struck her that this look
was the forerunner of death; but, as the rigidity melted out of the
countenance and the natural colour returned, and she saw that he was
himself once again, all worldly mortification sank to nothing before the
consciousness of the great blessing that he himself by his simple
existence was to her. She thanked God for this, and this alone, with a
fervour that swept away all rebellious feelings from her mind.

He did not speak readily; but he went and opened the shutters, and let
the ruddy light of dawn flood the room. But the wind was in the east;
the weather was piercing cold, as it had been for weeks; there would be
no demand for light summer goods this year. That hope for the revival of
trade must utterly be given up.

It was a great comfort to have had this conversation with his mother;
and to feel sure that, however they might henceforward keep silence on
all these anxieties, they yet understood each other's feelings, and
were, if not in harmony, at least not in discord with each other, in
their way of viewing them. Fanny's husband was vexed at Thornton's
refusal to take any share in the speculation which he had offered to
him, and withdrew from any possibility of being supposed able to assist
him with the ready money, which indeed the speculator needed for his own
venture.

There was nothing for it at last, but that which Mr. Thornton had
dreaded for many weeks; he had to give up the business in which he had
been so long engaged with so much honour and success; and look out for a
subordinate situation. Marlborough Mills and the adjacent dwelling were
held under a long lease; they must, if possible, be relet. There was an
immediate choice of situations offered to Mr. Thornton. Mr. Hamper would
have been only too glad to have secured him as a steady and experienced
partner for his son, whom he was setting up with a large capital in a
neighbouring town; but the young man was half-educated as regarded
information, and wholly uneducated as regarded any other responsibility
than that of getting money, and brutalised both as to his pleasures and
his pains. Mr. Thornton declined having any share in a partnership,
which would frustrate what few plans he had that survived the wreck of
his fortunes. He would sooner consent to be only a manager, where he
could have a certain degree of power beyond the mere money-getting part,
than have to fall in with the tyrannical humours of a moneyed partner
with whom he felt sure that he should quarrel in a few months.

So he waited, and stood on one side with profound humility, as the news
swept through the Exchange, of the enormous fortune which his
brother-in-law had made by his daring speculation. It was a nine days'
wonder. Success brought with it its worldly consequence of extreme
admiration. No one was considered so wise and far-seeing as Mr. Watson.




CHAPTER LI

MEETING AGAIN

    'Bear up, brave heart! we will be calm and strong;
     Sure, we can master eyes, or cheek, or tongue,
     Nor let the smallest tell-tale sign appear
     She ever was, and is, and will be dear.'
              RHYMING PLAY.


It was a hot summer's evening. Edith came into Margaret's bedroom, the
first time in her habit, the second ready dressed for dinner. No one was
there at first; the next time Edith found Dixon laying out Margaret's
dress on the bed; but no Margaret. Edith remained to fidget about.

'Oh, Dixon! not those horrid blue flowers to that dead gold-coloured
gown. What taste! Wait a minute, and I will bring you some pomegranate
blossoms.'

'It's not a dead gold-colour, ma'am. It's a straw-colour. And blue
always goes with straw-colour.' But Edith had brought the brilliant
scarlet flowers before Dixon had got half through her remonstrance.

'Where is Miss Hale?' asked Edith, as soon as she had tried the effect
of the garniture. 'I can't think,' she went on, pettishly, 'how my aunt
allowed her to get into such rambling habits in Milton! I'm sure I'm
always expecting to hear of her having met with something horrible among
all those wretched places she pokes herself into. I should never dare to
go down some of those streets without a servant. They're not fit for
ladies.'

Dixon was still huffed about her despised taste; so she replied, rather
shortly:

'It's no wonder to my mind, when I hear ladies talk such a deal about
being ladies--and when they're such fearful, delicate, dainty ladies
too--I say it's no wonder to me that there are no longer any saints on
earth---- '

'Oh, Margaret! here you are! I have been so wanting you. But how your
cheeks are flushed with the heat, poor child! But only think what that
tiresome Henry has done; really, he exceeds brother-in-law's limits.
Just when my party was made up so beautifully--fitted in so precisely
for Mr. Colthurst--there has Henry come, with an apology it is true, and
making use of your name for an excuse, and asked me if he may bring that
Mr. Thornton of Milton--your tenant, you know--who is in London about
some law business. It will spoil my number, quite.'

'I don't mind dinner. I don't want any,' said Margaret, in a low voice.
'Dixon can get me a cup of tea here, and I will be in the drawing-room
by the time you come up. I shall really be glad to lie down.'

'No, no! that will never do. You do look wretchedly white, to be sure;
but that is just the heat, and we can't do without you possibly. (Those
flowers a little lower, Dixon. They look glorious flames, Margaret, in
your black hair.) You know we planned you to talk about Milton to Mr.
Colthurst. Oh! to be sure! and this man comes from Milton. I believe it
will be capital, after all. Mr. Colthurst can pump him well on all the
subjects in which he is interested, and it will be great fun to trace
out your experiences, and this Mr. Thornton's wisdom, in Mr. Colthurst's
next speech in the House. Really, I think it is a happy hit of Henry's.
I asked him if he was a man one would be ashamed of; and he replied,
"Not if you've any sense in you, my little sister." So I suppose he is
able to sound his h's, which is not a common Darkshire accomplishment--eh,
Margaret?'

'Mr. Lennox did not say why Mr. Thornton was come up to town? Was it law
business connected with the property?' asked Margaret, in a constrained
voice.

'Oh! he's failed, or something of the kind, that Henry told you of that
day you had such a headache,--what was it? (There, that's capital,
Dixon. Miss Hale does us credit, does she not?) I wish I was as tall as
a queen, and as brown as a gipsy, Margaret.'

'But about Mr. Thornton?'

'Oh I really have such a terrible head for law business. Henry will like
nothing better than to tell you all about it. I know the impression he
made upon me was, that Mr. Thornton is very badly off, and a very
respectable man, and that I'm to be very civil to him; and as I did not
know how, I came to you to ask you to help me. And now come down with
me, and rest on the sofa for a quarter of an hour.'

The privileged brother-in-law came early and Margaret reddening as she
spoke, began to ask him the questions she wanted to hear answered about
Mr. Thornton.

'He came up about this sub-letting the property--Marlborough Mills, and
the house and premises adjoining, I mean. He is unable to keep it on;
and there are deeds and leases to be looked over, and agreements to be
drawn up. I hope Edith will receive him properly; but she was rather put
out, as I could see, by the liberty I had taken in begging for an
invitation for him. But I thought you would like to have some attention
shown him: and one would be particularly scrupulous in paying every
respect to a man who is going down in the world.' He had dropped his
voice to speak to Margaret, by whom he was sitting; but as he ended he
sprang up, and introduced Mr. Thornton, who had that moment entered, to
Edith and Captain Lennox.

Margaret looked with an anxious eye at Mr. Thornton while he was thus
occupied. It was considerably more than a year since she had seen him;
and events had occurred to change him much in that time. His fine figure
yet bore him above the common height of men; and gave him a
distinguished appearance, from the ease of motion which arose out of it,
and was natural to him; but his face looked older and care-worn; yet a
noble composure sate upon it, which impressed those who had just been
hearing of his changed position, with a sense of inherent dignity and
manly strength. He was aware, from the first glance he had given round
the room, that Margaret was there; he had seen her intent look of
occupation as she listened to Mr. Henry Lennox; and he came up to her
with the perfectly regulated manner of an old friend. With his first
calm words a vivid colour flashed into her cheeks, which never left them
again during the evening. She did not seem to have much to say to him.
She disappointed him by the quiet way in which she asked what seemed to
him to be the merely necessary questions respecting her old
acquaintances, in Milton; but others came in--more intimate in the house
than he--and he fell into the background, where he and Mr. Lennox talked
together from time to time.

'You think Miss Hale looking well,' said Mr. Lennox, 'don't you? Milton
didn't agree with her, I imagine; for when she first came to London, I
thought I had never seen any one so much changed. To-night she is
looking radiant. But she is much stronger. Last autumn she was fatigued
with a walk of a couple of miles. On Friday evening we walked up to
Hampstead and back. Yet on Saturday she looked as well as she does now.

'We!' Who? They two alone?

Mr. Colthurst was a very clever man, and a rising member of parliament.
He had a quick eye at discerning character, and was struck by a remark
which Mr. Thornton made at dinner-time. He enquired from Edith who that
gentleman was; and, rather to her surprise, she found, from the tone of
his 'Indeed!' that Mr. Thornton of Milton was not such an unknown name
to him as she had imagined it would be. Her dinner was going off well.
Henry was in good humour, and brought out his dry caustic wit admirably.
Mr. Thornton and Mr. Colthurst found one or two mutual subjects of
interest, which they could only touch upon then, reserving them for more
private after-dinner talk. Margaret looked beautiful in the pomegranate
flowers; and if she did lean back in her chair and speak but little,
Edith was not annoyed, for the conversation flowed on smoothly without
her. Margaret was watching Mr. Thornton's face. He never looked at her;
so she might study him unobserved, and note the changes which even this
short time had wrought in him. Only at some unexpected mot of Mr.
Lennox's, his face flashed out into the old look of intense enjoyment;
the merry brightness returned to his eyes, the lips just parted to
suggest the brilliant smile of former days; and for an instant, his
glance instinctively sought hers, as if he wanted her sympathy. But when
their eyes met, his whole countenance changed; he was grave and anxious
once more; and he resolutely avoided even looking near her again during
dinner.

There were only two ladies besides their own party, and as these were
occupied in conversation by her aunt and Edith, when they went up into
the drawing-room, Margaret languidly employed herself about some work.
Presently the gentlemen came up, Mr. Colthurst and Mr. Thornton in close
conversation. Mr. Lennox drew near to Margaret, and said in a low voice:

'I really think Edith owes me thanks for my contribution to her party.
You've no idea what an agreeable, sensible fellow this tenant of yours
is. He has been the very man to give Colthurst all the facts he wanted
coaching in. I can't conceive how he contrived to mismanage his
affairs.'

'With his powers and opportunities you would have succeeded,' said
Margaret. He did not quite relish the tone in which she spoke, although
the words but expressed a thought which had passed through his own mind.
As he was silent, they caught a swell in the sound of conversation going
on near the fire-place between Mr. Colthurst and Mr. Thornton.

'I assure you, I heard it spoken of with great interest--curiosity as to
its result, perhaps I should rather say. I heard your name frequently
mentioned during my short stay in the neighbourhood.' Then they lost
some words; and when next they could hear Mr. Thornton was speaking.

'I have not the elements for popularity--if they spoke of me in that
way, they were mistaken. I fall slowly into new projects; and I find it
difficult to let myself be known, even by those whom I desire to know,
and with whom I would fain have no reserve. Yet, even with all these
drawbacks, I felt that I was on the right path, and that, starting from
a kind of friendship with one, I was becoming acquainted with many. The
advantages were mutual: we were both unconsciously and consciously
teaching each other.'

'You say "were." I trust you are intending to pursue the same course?'

'I must stop Colthurst,' said Henry Lennox, hastily. And by an abrupt,
yet apropos question, he turned the current of the conversation, so as
not to give Mr. Thornton the mortification of acknowledging his want of
success and consequent change of position. But as soon as the
newly-started subject had come to a close, Mr. Thornton resumed the
conversation just where it had been interrupted, and gave Mr. Colthurst
the reply to his inquiry.

'I have been unsuccessful in business, and have had to give up my
position as a master. I am on the look out for a situation in Milton,
where I may meet with employment under some one who will be willing to
let me go along my own way in such matters as these. I can depend upon
myself for having no go-ahead theories that I would rashly bring into
practice. My only wish is to have the opportunity of cultivating some
intercourse with the hands beyond the mere "cash nexus." But it might be
the point Archimedes sought from which to move the earth, to judge from
the importance attached to it by some of our manufacturers, who shake
their heads and look grave as soon as I name the one or two experiments
that I should like to try.'

'You call them "experiments" I notice,' said Mr. Colthurst, with a
delicate increase of respect in his manner.

'Because I believe them to be such. I am not sure of the consequences
that may result from them. But I am sure they ought to be tried. I have
arrived at the conviction that no mere institutions, however wise, and
however much thought may have been required to organise and arrange
them, can attach class to class as they should be attached, unless the
working out of such institutions bring the individuals of the different
classes into actual personal contact. Such intercourse is the very
breath of life. A working man can hardly be made to feel and know how
much his employer may have laboured in his study at plans for the
benefit of his workpeople. A complete plan emerges like a piece of
machinery, apparently fitted for every emergency. But the hands accept
it as they do machinery, without understanding the intense mental labour
and forethought required to bring it to such perfection. But I would
take an idea, the working out of which would necessitate personal
intercourse; it might not go well at first, but at every hitch interest
would be felt by an increasing number of men, and at last its success in
working come to be desired by all, as all had borne a part in the
formation of the plan; and even then I am sure that it would lose its
vitality, cease to be living, as soon as it was no longer carried on by
that sort of common interest which invariably makes people find means
and ways of seeing each other, and becoming acquainted with each others'
characters and persons, and even tricks of temper and modes of speech.
We should understand each other better, and I'll venture to say we
should like each other more.'

'And you think they may prevent the recurrence of strikes?'

'Not at all. My utmost expectation only goes so far as this--that they
may render strikes not the bitter, venomous sources of hatred they have
hitherto been. A more hopeful man might imagine that a closer and more
genial intercourse between classes might do away with strikes. But I am
not a hopeful man.'

Suddenly, as if a new idea had struck him, he crossed over to where
Margaret was sitting, and began, without preface, as if he knew she had
been listening to all that had passed:

'Miss Hale, I had a round-robin from some of my men--I suspect in
Higgins' handwriting--stating their wish to work for me, if ever I was
in a position to employ men again on my own behalf. That was good,
wasn't it?'

'Yes. Just right. I am glad of it,' said Margaret, looking up straight
into his face with her speaking eyes, and then dropping them under his
eloquent glance. He gazed back at her for a minute, as if he did not
know exactly what he was about. Then sighed; and saying, 'I knew you
would like it,' he turned away, and never spoke to her again until he
bid her a formal 'good night.'

As Mr. Lennox took his departure, Margaret said, with a blush that she
could not repress, and with some hesitation,

'Can I speak to you to-morrow? I want your help about--something.'

'Certainly. I will come at whatever time you name. You cannot give me a
greater pleasure than by making me of any use. At eleven? Very well.'

His eye brightened with exultation. How she was learning to depend upon
him! It seemed as if any day now might give him the certainty, without
having which he had determined never to offer to her again.




CHAPTER LII

'PACK CLOUDS AWAY'

    'For joy or grief, for hope or fear,
     For all hereafter, as for here,
     In peace or strife, in storm or shine.'
              ANON.


Edith went about on tip-toe, and checked Sholto in all loud speaking
that next morning, as if any sudden noise would interrupt the conference
that was taking place in the drawing-room. Two o'clock came; and they
still sate there with closed doors. Then there was a man's footstep
running down stairs; and Edith peeped out of the drawing-room.

'Well, Henry?' said she, with a look of interrogation.

'Well!' said he, rather shortly.

'Come in to lunch!'

'No, thank you, I can't. I've lost too much time here already.'

'Then it's not all settled,' said Edith despondingly.

'No! not at all. It never will be settled, if the "it" is what I
conjecture you mean. That will never be, Edith, so give up thinking
about it.'

'But it would be so nice for us all,' pleaded Edith. 'I should always
feel comfortable about the children, if I had Margaret settled down near
me. As it is, I am always afraid of her going off to Cadiz.'

'I will try, when I marry, to look out for a young lady who has a
knowledge of the management of children. That is all I can do. Miss Hale
would not have me. And I shall not ask her.'

'Then, what have you been talking about?'

'A thousand things you would not understand: investments, and leases,
and value of land.'

'Oh, go away if that's all. You and she will be unbearably stupid, if
you've been talking all this time about such weary things.'

'Very well. I'm coming again to-morrow, and bringing Mr. Thornton with
me, to have some more talk with Miss Hale.'

'Mr. Thornton! What has he to do with it?'

'He is Miss Hale's tenant,' said Mr. Lennox, turning away. 'And he
wishes to give up his lease.'

'Oh! very well. I can't understand details, so don't give them me.'

'The only detail I want you to understand is, to let us have the back
drawing-room undisturbed, as it was to-day. In general, the children and
servants are so in and out, that I can never get any business
satisfactorily explained; and the arrangements we have to make to-morrow
are of importance.'

No one ever knew why Mr. Lennox did not keep to his appointment on the
following day. Mr. Thornton came true to his time; and, after keeping
him waiting for nearly an hour, Margaret came in looking very white and
anxious.

She began hurriedly:

'I am so sorry Mr. Lennox is not here,--he could have done it so much
better than I can. He is my adviser in this'----

'I am sorry that I came, if it troubles you. Shall I go to Mr. Lennox's
chambers and try and find him?'

'No, thank you. I wanted to tell you, how grieved I was to find that I
am to lose you as a tenant. But, Mr. Lennox says, things are sure to
brighten'----

'Mr. Lennox knows little about it,' said Mr. Thornton quietly. 'Happy
and fortunate in all a man cares for, he does not understand what it is
to find oneself no longer young--yet thrown back to the starting-point
which requires the hopeful energy of youth--to feel one half of life
gone, and nothing done--nothing remaining of wasted opportunity, but the
bitter recollection that it has been. Miss Hale, I would rather not hear
Mr. Lennox's opinion of my affairs. Those who are happy and successful
themselves are too apt to make light of the misfortunes of others.'

'You are unjust,' said Margaret, gently. 'Mr. Lennox has only spoken of
the great probability which he believes there to be of your
redeeming--your more than redeeming what you have lost--don't speak till
I have ended--pray don't!' And collecting herself once more, she went on
rapidly turning over some law papers, and statements of accounts in a
trembling hurried manner. 'Oh! here it is! and--he drew me out a
proposal--I wish he was here to explain it--showing that if you would
take some money of mine, eighteen thousand and fifty-seven pounds, lying
just at this moment unused in the bank, and bringing me in only two and
a half per cent.--you could pay me much better interest, and might go on
working Marlborough Mills.' Her voice had cleared itself and become more
steady. Mr. Thornton did not speak, and she went on looking for some
paper on which were written down the proposals for security; for she was
most anxious to have it all looked upon in the light of a mere business
arrangement, in which the principal advantage would be on her side.
While she sought for this paper, her very heart-pulse was arrested by
the tone in which Mr. Thornton spoke. His voice was hoarse, and
trembling with tender passion, as he said:--

'Margaret!'

For an instant she looked up; and then sought to veil her luminous eyes
by dropping her forehead on her hands. Again, stepping nearer, he
besought her with another tremulous eager call upon her name.

'Margaret!'

Still lower went the head; more closely hidden was the face, almost
resting on the table before her. He came close to her. He knelt by her
side, to bring his face to a level with her ear; and whispered-panted
out the words:--

'Take care.--If you do not speak--I shall claim you as my own in some
strange presumptuous way.--Send me away at once, if I must
go;--Margaret!--'

At that third call she turned her face, still covered with her small
white hands, towards him, and laid it on his shoulder, hiding it even
there; and it was too delicious to feel her soft cheek against his, for
him to wish to see either deep blushes or loving eyes. He clasped her
close. But they both kept silence. At length she murmured in a broken
voice:

'Oh, Mr. Thornton, I am not good enough!'

'Not good enough! Don't mock my own deep feeling of unworthiness.'

After a minute or two, he gently disengaged her hands from her face, and
laid her arms as they had once before been placed to protect him from
the rioters.

'Do you remember, love?' he murmured. 'And how I requited you with my
insolence the next day?'

'I remember how wrongly I spoke to you,--that is all.'

'Look here! Lift up your head. I have something to show you!' She slowly
faced him, glowing with beautiful shame.

'Do you know these roses?' he said, drawing out his pocket-book, in
which were treasured up some dead flowers.

'No!' she replied, with innocent curiosity. 'Did I give them to you?'

'No! Vanity; you did not. You may have worn sister roses very probably.'

She looked at them, wondering for a minute, then she smiled a little as
she said--

'They are from Helstone, are they not? I know the deep indentations
round the leaves. Oh! have you been there? When were you there?'

'I wanted to see the place where Margaret grew to what she is, even at
the worst time of all, when I had no hope of ever calling her mine. I
went there on my return from Havre.'

'You must give them to me,' she said, trying to take them out of his
hand with gentle violence.

'Very well. Only you must pay me for them!'

'How shall I ever tell Aunt Shaw?' she whispered, after some time of
delicious silence.

'Let me speak to her.'

'Oh, no! I owe to her,--but what will she say?'

'I can guess. Her first exclamation will be, "That man!"'

'Hush!' said Margaret, 'or I shall try and show you your mother's
indignant tones as she says, "That woman!"'
