           _Enter_ GAVESTON, _reading a letter._

_Gav. My father is deceas'd.  Come, Gaveston,
   And share the kingdom with thy dearest friend._
   Ah, words that make me surfeit with delight!
   What greater bliss can hap to Gaveston
   Than live and be the favourite of a king!
   Sweet prince, I come! these, thy amorous lines
   Might have enforc'd me to have swum from France,
   And, like Leander, gasp'd upon the sand,
   So thou wouldst smile, and take me in thine arms.
   The sight of London to my exil'd eyes
   Is as Elysium to a new-come soul:
   Not that I love the city or the men,
   But that it harbours him I hold so dear,--
   The king, upon whose bosom let me lie,
   And with the world be still at enmity.
   What need the arctic people love star-light,
   To whom the sun shines both by day and night?
   Farewell base stooping to the lordly peers!
   My knee shall bow to none but to the king.
   As for the multitude, that are but sparks,
   Rak'd up in embers of their poverty,--
   _Tanti,_--I'll fawn first on the wind,
   That glanceth at my lips, and flieth away.

                _Enter three_ Poor Men.

   But how now! what are these?
_Poor Men._ Such as desire your worship's service.
_Gav._ What canst thou do?
_First P. Man._ I can ride.
_Gav._ But I have no horse.--What art thou?
_Sec. P. Man._ A traveller.
_Gav._ Let me see; thou wouldst do well
   To wait at my trencher, and tell me lies at dinner-time;
   And, as I like your discoursing, I'll have you.--
   And what art thou?
_Third P. Man._ A soldier, that hath serv'd against the Scot.
_Gav._ Why, there are hospitals for such as you:
   I have no war; and therefore, sir, be gone.
_Third P. Man._ Farewell, and perish by a soldier's hand,
   That wouldst reward them with an hospital!
_Gav._ Ay, ay, these words of his move me as much
   As if a goose should play the porcupine,
   And dart her plumes, thinking to pierce my breast.
   But yet it is no pain to speak men fair;
   I'll flatter these, and make them live in hope.--            [_Aside._
   You know that I came lately out of France,
   And yet I have not view'd my lord the king:
   If I speed well, I'll entertain you all.
_All._ We thank your worship.
_Gav._ I have some business: leave me to myself.
_All._ We will wait here about the court.
_Gav._ Do.                                            [_Exeunt Poor Men._
            These are not men for me;
   I must have wanton poets, pleasant wits,
   Musicians, that with touching of a string
   May draw the pliant king which way I please:
   Music and poetry is his delight;
   Therefore I'll have Italian masks by night,
   Sweet speeches, comedies, and pleasing shows;
   And in the day, when he shall walk abroad,
   Like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad;
   My men, like satyrs grazing on the lawns,
   Shall with their goat-feet dance the antic hay;
   Sometime a lovely boy in Dian's shape,
   With hair that gilds the water as it glides
   Crownets of pearl about his naked arms,
   And in his sportful hands an olive-tree,
   To hide those parts which men delight to see,
   Shall bathe him in a spring; and there, hard by,
   One like Actæon, peeping through the grove,
   Shall by the angry goddess be transform'd,
   And running in the likeness of an hart,
   By yelping hounds pull'd down, shall semm to die:
   Such things as these best please his majesty.--
   Here comes my lord the king, and the nobles,
   From the parliament.  I'll stand aside.                    [_Retires._

_Enter_ KING EDWARD, KENT, LANCASTER, _the elder_ MORTIMER,
      _the younger_ MORTIMER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _and_
      Attendants.

_K. Edw._ Lancaster!
_Lan._ My lord?
_Gav._ That Earl of Lancaster do I abhor.                       [_Aside._
_K. Edw._ Will you not grant me this?--In spite of them
   I'll have my will; and these two Mortimers,
   That cross me thus, shall know I am displeased.              [_Aside._
_E. Mor._ If you love us, my lord, hate Gaveston.
_Gav._ That villain Mortimer! I'll be his death.                [_Aside._
__Y. Mor._ Mine uncle here, this earl, and I myself,
   Were sworn to your father at his death,
   That he should ne'er return into the realm:
   And now, my lord, ere I will break my oath,
   This sword of mine, that should offend your foes,
   Shall sleep within the scabbard at thy need,
   And underneath thy banners march who will,
   For Mortimer will hang his armour up.
_Gav. Mort dieu!_                                               [_Aside._
_K. Edw._ Well, Mortimer, I'll make thee rue these words:
   Beseems it thee to contradict thy king?
   Frown'st thou thereat, aspiring Lancaster?
   The sword shall plane the furrows of thy brows,
   And hew these knees that now are grown so stiff.
   I will have Gaveston; and you shall know
   What danger 'tis to stand against your king.
_Gav._ Well done, Ned!                                          [_Aside._
_Lan._ My lord, why do you thus incense your peers,
   That naturally would love and honour you,
   But for that base and obscure Gaveston?
   Four earldoms have I, besides Lancaster,--
   Derby, Salisbury, Lincoln, Leicester;
   These will I sell, to give my soldiers pay,
   Ere Gaveston shall stay within the realm:
   Therefore, if he be come, expel him straight.
_Kent._ Barons and earls, your pride hath made me mute;
   But know I'll speak, and to the proof, I hope.
   I do remember, in my father's days,
   Lord Percy of the North, being highly mov'd,
   Brav'd Mowbray in presence of the king;
   For which, had not his highness lov'd him well,
   He should have lost his head; but with his look
   Th' undaunted spirit of Percy was appeas'd,
   And Mowbray and he were reconcil'd:
   Yet dare you brave the king unto his face.--
   Brother, revenge it, and let these their heads
   Preach upon poles, for trespass of their tongues.
_War._ O, our heads!
_K. Edw._ Ay, yours; and therefore I would wish you grant.
_War._ Bridle thy anger, gentle Mortimer.
_Y. Mor._ I cannot, nor I will not; I must speak.--
   Cousin, our hands I hope shall fence our heads,
   And strike off his that makes you threaten us.--
   Come, uncle, let us leave the brain-sick king,
   And henceforth parley with our naked swords.
_E. Mor._ Wiltshire hath men enough to save our heads.
_War._ All Warwickshire will leave him for my sake.
_Lan._ And northward Lancaster hath many friends.--
   Adieu, my lord; and either change your mind,
   Or look to see the throne, where you should sit,
   To float in blood, and at thy wanton head
   The glozing head of thy base minion thrown.
       [_Exeunt all except King Edward, Kent, Gaveston,
          and attendants._
_K. Edw._ I cannot brook these haughty menaces:
   Am I a king, and must be over-rul'd!--
   Brother, display my ensigns in the field:
   I'll bandy with the barons and the earls,
   And either die or live with Gaveston.
_Gav._ I can no longer keep me from my lord.            [_Comes forward._
_K. Edw._ What, Gaveston! welcome!  Kiss not my hand:
   Embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee.
   Why shouldst thou kneel? know'st thou not who I am?
   Thy friend, thyself, another Gaveston:
   Not Hylas was more mourned for of Hercules
   Than thou hast been of me since thy exile.
_Gav._ And, since I went from hence, no soul in hell
   Hath felt more torment than poor Gaveston.
_K. Edw._ I know it.--Brother, welcome home my friend.--
   Now let the treacherous Mortimers conspire,
   And that high-minded Earl of Lancaster:
   I have my wish, in that I joy thy sight;
   And sooner shall the sea o'erwhelm my land
   Than bear the ship that shall transport thee hence.
   I here create thee Lord High-chamberlain,
   Chief Secretary to the state and me,
   Earl of Cornwall, King and Lord of Man.
_Gav._ My lord, these titles far exceed my worth.
_Kent._ Brother, the least of these may well suffice
   For one of greater birth than Gaveston.
_K. Edw._ Cease, brother, for I cannot brook these words.--
   Thy worth, sweet friend, is far above my gifts:
   Therefore, to equal it, receive my heart.
   If for these dignities thou be envied,
   I'll give thee more; for, but to honour thee,
   Is Edward pleas'd with kingly regiment.
   Fear'st thou thy person? thou shalt have a guard:
   Wantest thou gold? go to my treasury:
   Wouldst thou be lov'd and fear'd? receive my seal,
   Save or condemn, and in our name command
   What so thy mind affects, or fancy likes.
_Gav._ It shall suffice me to enjoy your love;
   Which whiles I have, I think myself as great
   As Cæsar riding in the Roman street,
   With captive kings at his triumphant car.

              _Enter the_ BISHOP OF COVENTRY.

_K. Edw._ Whither goes my Lord of Coventry so fast?
_Bish. of Cov._ To celebrate your father's exequies.
   But is that wicked Gaveston return'd?
_K. Edw._ Ay, priest, and lives to be reveng'd on thee,
   That wert the only cause of his exile.
_Gav._ 'Tis true; and, but for reverence of these robes,
   Thou shouldst not plod one foot beyond this place.
_Bish. of Cov._ I did no more than I was bound to do:
   And, Gaveston, unless thou be reclaim'd,
   As then I did incense the parliament,
   So will I now, and thou shalt back to France.
_Gav._ Saving your reverence, you must pardon me.
_K. Edw._ Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole,
   And in the channel christen him anew.
_Kent._ Ay, brother, lay not violent hands on him!
   For he'll complain unto the see of Rome.
_Gav._ Let him complain unto the see of hell:
   I'll be reveng'd on him for my exile.
_K. Edw._ No, spare his life, but seize upon his goods:
   Be thou lord bishop, and receive his rents,
   And make him serve thee as thy chaplain:
   I give him thee; here, use him as thou wilt.
_Gav._ He shall to prison, and there die in bolts.
_K. Edw._ Ay, to the Tower, the Fleet, or where thou wilt.
_Bish. of Cov._ For this offence be thou accurs'd of God!
_K. Edw._ Who's there?  Convey this priest to the Tower.
_Bish. of Cov._ True, true.
_K. Edw._ But, in the meantime, Gaveston, away,
   And take possession of his house and goods.
   Come, follow me, and thou shalt have my guard
   To see it done, and bring thee safe again.
_Gav._ What should a priest do with so fair a house?
   A prison may beseem his holiness.                           [_Exeunt._

 _Enter, on one side, the elder_ MORTIMER, _and the younger_
   MORTIMER; _on the other,_ WARWICK, _and_ LANCASTER.

_War._ 'Tis true, the bishop is in the Tower,
   And goods and body given to Gaveston.
_Lan._ What, will they tyrannise upon the church?
   Ah, wicked King! accursed Gaveston!
   This ground, which is corrupted with their steps,
   Shall be their timeless sepulchre or mine.
_Y. Mor._ Well, let that peevish Frenchman guard him sure;
   Unless his breast be sword-proof, he shall die.
_E. Mor._ How now! why droops the Earl of Lancaster?
_Y. Mor._ Wherefore is Guy of Warwick discontent?
_Lan._ That villain Gaveston is made an earl.
_E. Mor._ An earl!
_War._ Ay, and besides Lord-chamberlain of the realm,
   And Secretary too, and Lord of Man.
_E. Mor._ We may not nor we will not suffer this.
_Y. Mor._ Why post we not from hence to levy men?
_Lan._ "My Lord of Cornwall" now at every word;
   And happy is the man whom he vouchsafes,
   For vailing of his bonnet, one good look.
   Thus, arm in arm, the king and he doth march:
   Nay, more, the guard upon his lordship waits,
   And all the court begins to flatter him.
_War._ Thus leaning on the shoulder of the king,
   He nods, and scorns, and smiles at those that pass.
_E. Mor._ Doth no man take exceptions at the slave?
_Lan._ All stomach him, but none dare speak a word.
_Y. Mor._ Ah, that bewrays their baseness, Lancaster!
   Were all the earls and barons of my mind,
   We'd hale him from the bosom of the king,
   And at the court-gate hang the peasant up,
   Who, swoln with venom of ambitious pride,
   Will be the ruin of the realm and us.
_War._ Here comes my Lord of Canterbury's grace.
_Lan._ His countenance bewrays he is displeas'd.


    _Enter the_ ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, _and an_
                     Attendant.

_Archb. of Cant._ First, were his sacred garments rent and torn;
   Then laid they violent hands upon him; next,
   Himself imprison'd, and his goods asseiz'd:
   This certify the Pope: away, take horse.            [_Exit Attendant._
_Lan._ My lord, will you take arms against the king?
_Archb. of Cant._ What need I?  God himself is up in arms
   When violence is offer'd to the church.
_Y. Mor._ Then will you join with us, that be his peers,
   To banish or behead that Gaveston?
_Archb. of Cant._ What else, my lords? for it concerns me near;
   The bishoprick of Coventry is his.

                   _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA.

_Y. Mor._ Madam, whither walks your majesty so fast?
_Q. Isab._ Unto the forest, gentle Mortimer,
   To live in grief and baleful discontent;
   For now my lord the king regards me not,
   But dotes upon the love of Gaveston:
   He claps his cheeks, and hangs about his neck,
   Smiles in his face, and whispers in his ears;
   And, when I come, he frowns, as who should say,
   "Go whither thou wilt, seeing I have Gaveston."
_E. Mor._ Is it not strange that he is thus bewitch'd?
_Y. Mor._ Madam, return unto the court again:
   That sly inveigling Frenchman we'll exile,
   Or lose our lives; and yet, ere that day come,
   The king shall lose his crown; for we have power,
   And courage too, to be reveng'd at full.
_Archb. of Cant._ But yet lift not your swords against the king.
_Lan._ No; but we will lift Gaveston from hence.
_War._ And war must be the means, or he'll stay still.
_Q. Isab._ Then let him stay; for, rather than my lord
   Shall be oppress'd with civil mutinies,
   I will endure a melancholy life,
   And let him frolic with his minion.
_Archb. of Cant._ My lords, to ease all this, but hear me speak:
   We and the rest, that are his counsellors,
   Will meet, and with a general consent
   Confirm his banishment with our hands and seals.
_Lan._ What we confirm the king will frustrate.
_Y. Mor._ Then may we lawfully revolt from him.
_War._ But say, my lord, where shall this meeting be?
_Archb. of Cant._ At the New Temple.
_Y. Mor._ Content.
_Archb. of Cant._ And, in the meantime, I'll entreat you all
   To cross to Lambeth, and there stay with me.
_Lan._ Come, then, let's away.
_Y. Mor._ Madam, farewell.
_Q. Isab._ Farewell, sweet Mortimer, and, for my sake,
   Forbear to levy arms against the king.
_Y. Mor._ Ay, if words will serve; if not, I must.             [_Exeunt._

               _Enter_ GAVESTON _and_ KENT.

_Gav._ Edmund, the mighty prince of Lancaster,
   That hath more earldoms than an ass can bear,
   And both the Mortimers, two goodly men,
   With Guy of Warwick, that redoubted knight,
   Are gone towards Lambeth: there let them remain.                 [_Exeunt._

_Enter_ LANCASTER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _the elder_
    MORTIMER, _the younger_ MORTIMER, _the_ ARCHBISHOP
    OF CANTERBURY, _and_ Attendants.

_Lan._ Here is the form of Gaveston's exile;
   May it please your lordship to subscribe your name.
_Archb. of Cant._ Give me the paper.
                            [_He subscribes, as the others do after him._
_Lan._ Quick, quick, my lord; I long to write my name.
_War._ But I long more to see him banish'd hence.
_Y. Mor._ The name of Mortimer shall fright the king,
   Unless he be declin'd from that base peasant.

    _Enter_ KING EDWARD, GAVESTON, _and_ KENT.

_K. Edw._ What, are you mov'd that Gaveston sits here?
   It is our pleasure; we will have it so.
_Lan._ Your grace doth well to place him by your side,
   For nowhere else the new earl is so safe.
_E. Mor._ What man of noble birth can brook this sight?
   _Quam male conveniunt!--_
   See, what a scornful look the peasant casts!
_Pem._ Can kingly lions fawn on creeping ants?
_War._ Ignoble vassal, that, like Phaeton,
   Aspir'st unto the guidance of the sun!
_Y. Mor._ Their downfall is at hand, their forces down:
   We will not thus be fac'd and over-peer'd.
_K. Edw._ Lay hands on that traitor Mortimer!
_E. Mor._ Lay hands on that traitor Gaveston!
_Kent._ Is this the duty that you owe your king?
_War._ We know our duties; let him know his peers.
_K. Edw._ Whither will you bear him? stay, or ye shall die.
_E. Mor._ We are no traitors; therefore threaten not.
_Gav._ No, threaten not, my lord, but pay them home.
   Were I a king--
_Y. Mor._ Thou, villain! wherefore talk'st thou of a king,
   That hardly art a gentleman by birth?
_K. Edw._ Were he a peasant, being my minion,
   I'll make the proudest of you stoop to him.
_Lan._ My lord--you may not thus disparage us.--
   Away, I say, with hateful Gaveston!
_E. Mor._ And with the Earl of Kent that favours him.
                                   [_Attendants remove Gaveston and Kent._
_K. Edw._ Nay, then, lay violent hands upon your king:
   Here, Mortimer, sit thou in Edward's throne;
   Warwick and Lancaster, wear you my crown.
   Was ever king thus over-rul'd as I?
_Lan._ Learn, then, to rule us better, and the realm.
_Y. Mor._ What we have done, our heart-blood shall maintain.
_War._ Think you that we can brook this upstart['s] pride?
_K. Edw._ Anger and wrathful fury stops my speech.
_Archb. of Cant._ Why are you not mov'd? be patient, my lord,
   And see what we your counsellors have done.
_Y. Mor._ My lords, now let us all be resolute,
   And either have our wills, or lose our lives.
_K. Edw._ Meet you for this, proud over-daring peers!
   Ere my sweet Gaveston shall part from me,
   This isle shall fleet upon the ocean,
   And wander to the unfrequented Inde.
_Archb. of Cant._ You know that I am legate to the Pope:
   On your allegiance to the see of Rome,
   Subscribe, as we have done, to his exile.
_Y. Mor._ Curse him, if he refuse; and then may we
   Depose him, and elect another king.
_K. Edw._ Ay, there it goes! but yet I will not yield:
   Curse me, depose me, do the worst you can.
_Lan._ Then linger not, my lord, but do it straight.
_Archb. of Cant._ Remember how the bishop was abus'd:
   Either banish him that was the cause thereof,
   Or I will presently discharge these lords
   Of duty and allegiance due to thee.
_K. Edw._ It boots me not to threat; I must speak fair:
   The legate of the Pope will be obey'd.--                     [_Aside._
   My lord, you shall be Chancellor of the realm;
   Thou, Lancaster, High-Admiral of our fleet;
   Young Mortimer and his uncle shall be earls;
   And you, Lord Warwick, President of the North;
   And thou of Wales.  If this content you not,
   Make several kingdoms of this monarchy,
   And share it equally amongst you all,
   So I may have some nook or corner left,
   To frolic with my dearest Gaveston.
_Archb. of Cant._ Nothing shall alter us; we are resolv'd.
_Lan._ Come, come, subscribe.
_Y. Mor._ Why should you love him whom the world hates so?
_K. Edw._ Because he loves me more than all the world.
   Ah, none but rude and savage-minded men
   Would seek the ruin of my Gaveston!
   You that be noble-born should pity him.
_War._ You that are princely-born should shake him off:
   For shame, subscribe, and let the clown depart.
_E. Mor._ Urge him, my lord.
_Archb. of Cant._ Are you content to banish him the realm?
_K. Edw._ I see I must, and therefore am content:
   Instead of ink, I'll write it with my tears.            [_Subscribes._
_Y. Mor._ The king is love-sick for his minion.
_K. Edw._ 'Tis done: and now, accursed hand, fall off!
_Lan._ Give it me: I'll have it publish'd in the streets.
_Y. Mor._ I'll see him presently despatch'd away.
_Archb. of Cant._ Now is my heart at ease.
_War._ And so is mine.
_Pem._ This will be good news to the common sort.
_E. Mor._ Be it or no, he shall not linger here.
                                        [_Exeunt all except King Edward._
_K. Edw._ How fast they run to banish him I love!
   They would not stir, were it to do me good.
   Why should a king be subject to a priest?
   Proud Rome, that hatchest such imperial grooms,
   With these thy superstitious taper-lights,
   Wherewith thy antichristian churches blaze,
   I'll fire thy crazed buildings, and enforce
   The papal towers to kiss the lowly ground,
   With slaughter'd priests make Tiber's channel swell,
   And banks rais'd higher with their sepulchres!
   As for the peers, that back the clergy thus,
   If I be king, not one of them shall live.

                  _Re-enter_ GAVESTON.

_Gav._ My lord, I hear it whisper'd everywhere,
   That I am banish'd and must fly the land.
_K. Edw._ 'Tis true, sweet Gaveston: O were it false!
   The legate of the Pope will have it so,
   And thou must hence, or I shall be depos'd.
   But I will reign to be reveng'd of them;
   And therefore, sweet friend, take it patiently.
   Live where thou wilt, I'll send thee gold enough;
   And long thou shalt not stay; or, if thou dost,
   I'll come to thee; my love shall ne'er decline.
_Gav._ Is all my hope turn'd to this hell of grief?
_K. Edw._ Rend not my heart with thy too-piercing words:
   Thou from this land, I from myself am banish'd.
_Gav._ To go from hence grieves not poor Gaveston;
   But to forsake you, in whose gracious looks
   The blessedness of Gaveston remains;
   For nowhere else seeks he felicity.
_K. Edw._ And only this torments my wretched soul,
   That, whether I will or no, thou must depart.
   Be governor of Ireland in my stead,
   And there abide till fortune call thee home.
   Here, take my picture, and let me wear thine:
                                               [_They exchange pictures._
   O, might I keep thee here, as I do this,
   Happy were I! but now most miserable.
_Gav._ 'Tis something to be pitied of a king.
_K. Edw._ Thou shalt not hence; I'll hide thee, Gaveston.
_Gav._ I shall be found, and then 'twill grieve me more.
_K. Edw._ Kind words and mutual talk makes our grief greater:
   Therefore, with dumb embracement, let us part,
   Stay, Gaveston; I cannot leave thee thus.
_Gav._ For every look, my love drops down a tear:
   Seeing I must go, do not renew my sorrow.
_K. Edw._ The time is little that thou hast to stay,
   And, therefore, give me leave to look my fill.
   But, come, sweet friend; I'll bear thee on thy way.
_Gav._ The peers will frown.
_K. Edw._ I pass not for their anger.  Come, let's go:
   O, that we might as well return as go!

               _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA.

_Q. Isab._ Whither goes my lord?
_K. Edw._ Fawn not on me, French strumpet; get thee gone!
_Q. Isab._ On whom but on my husband should I fawn?
_Gav._ On Mortimer; with whom, ungentle queen,--
   I judge no more--judge you the rest, my lord.
_Q. Isab._ In saying this, thou wrong'st me, Gaveston:
   Is't not enough that thou corrupt'st my lord,
   And art a bawd to his affections,
   But thou must call mine honour thus in question?
_Gav._ I mean not so; your grace must pardon me.
_K. Edw._ Thou art too familiar with that Mortimer,
   And by thy means is Gaveston exil'd:
   But I would wish thee reconcile the lords,
   Or thou shalt ne'er be reconcil'd to me.
_Q. Isab._ Your highness knows, it lies not in my power.
_K. Edw._ Away, then! touch me not.--Come, Gaveston.
_Q. Isab._ Villain, 'tis thou that robb'st me of my lord.
_Gav._ Madam, 'tis you that rob me of my lord.
_K. Edw._ Speak not unto her: let her droop and pine.
_Q. Isab._ Wherein, my lord, have I deserv'd these words?
   Witness the tears that Isabella sheds,
   Witness this heart, that, sighing for thee, breaks,
   How dear my lord is to poor Isabel!
_K. Edw._ And witness heaven how dear thou art to me:
   There weep; for, till my Gaveston be repeal'd,
   Assure thyself thou com'st not in my sight.
                                      [_Exeunt King Edward and Gaveston._
_Q. Isab._ O miserable and distressed queen!
   Would, when I left sweet France, and was embarked,
   That charming Circe, walking on the waves,
   Had chang'd my shape! or at the marriage-day
   The cup of Hymen had been full of poison!
   Or with those arms, that twin'd about my neck,
   I had been stifled, and not liv'd to see
   The king my lord thus to abandon me!
   Like frantic Juno, will I fill the earth
   With ghastly murmur of my sighs and cries;
   For never doted Jove on Ganymede
   So much as he on cursed Gaveston:
   But that will more exasperate his wrath;
   I must entreat him, I must speak him fair,
   And be a means to call home Gaveston:
   And yet he'll ever dote on Gaveston;
   And so am I for ever miserable.

  _Re-enter_ LANCASTER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _the elder_
       MORTIMER, _and the younger_ MORTIMER.

_Lan._ Look, where the sister of the king of France
   Sits wringing of her hands and beats her breast!
_War._ The king, I fear, hath ill-treated her.
_Pem._ Hard is the heart that injures such a saint.
_Y. Mor._ I know 'tis 'long of Gaveston she weeps.
_E. Mor._ Why, he is gone.
_Y. Mor._ Madam, how fares your grace?
_Q. Isab._ Ah, Mortimer, now breaks the king's hate forth,
   And he confesseth that he loves me not!
_Y. Mor._ Cry quittance, madam, then, and love not him.
_Q. Isab._ No, rather will I die a thousand deaths:
   And yet I love in vain; he'll ne'er love me.
_Lan._ Fear ye not, madam; now his minion's gone,
   His wanton humour will be quickly left.
_Q. Isab._ O, never, Lancaster! I am enjoin'd,
   To sue unto you all for his repeal:
   This wills my lord, and this must I perform,
   Or else be banish'd from his highness' presence.
_Lan._ For his repeal, madam! he comes not back,
   Unless the sea cast up his shipwreck'd body.
_War._ And to behold so sweet a sight as that,
   There's none here but would run his horse to death.
_Y. Mor._ But, madam, would you have us call him home?
_Q. Isab._ Ay, Mortimer, for, till he be restor'd,
   The angry king hath banish'd me the court;
   And, therefore, as thou lov'st and tender'st me,
   Be thou my advocate unto these peers.
_Y. Mor._ What, would you have me plead for Gaveston?
_E. Mor._ Plead for him that will, I am resolv'd.
_Lan._ And so am I, my lord: dissuade the queen.
_Q. Isab._ O, Lancaster, let him dissuade the king!
   For 'tis against my will he should return.
_War._ Then speak not for him; let the peasant go.
_Q. Isab._ 'Tis for myself I speak, and not for him.
_Pem._ No speaking will prevail; and therefore cease.
_Y. Mor._ Fair queen, forbear to angle for the fish
   Which, being caught, strikes him that takes it dead;
   I mean that vile torpedo, Gaveston,
   That now, I hope, floats on the Irish seas.
_Q. Isab._ Sweet Mortimer, sit down by me a while,
   And I will tell thee reasons of such weight
   As thou wilt soon subscribe to his repeal.
_Y. Mor._ It is impossible: but speak your mind.
_Q. Isab._ Then, thus;--but none shall hear it but ourselves.
                                               [_Talks to Y. Mor. apart._
_Lan._ My lords, albeit the queen win Mortimer,
   Will you be resolute and hold with me?
_E. Mor._ Not I, against my nephew.
_Pem._ Fear not; the queen's words cannot alter him.
_War._ No? do but mark how earnestly she pleads!
_Lan._ And see how coldly his looks make denial!
_War._ She smiles: now, for my life, his mind is chang'd!
_Lan._ I'll rather lose his friendship, I, than grant.
_Y. Mor._ Well, of necessity it must be so.--
   My lords, that I abhor base Gaveston
   I hope your honours make no question.
   And therefore, though I plead for his repeal,
   'Tis not for his sake, but to our avail;
   Nay, for the realm's behoof, and for the king's.
_Lan._ Fie, Mortimer, dishonour not thyself!
   Can this be true, 'twas good to banish him?
   And is this true, to call him home again?
   Such reasons make white black, and dark night day.
_Y. Mor._ My Lord of Lancaster, mark the respect.
_Lan._ In no respect can contraries be true.
_Q. Isab._ Yet, good my lord, hear what he can allege.
_War._ All that he speaks is nothing; we are resolv'd.
_Y. Mor._ Do you not wish that Gaveston were dead?
_Pem._ I would he were!
_Y. Mor._ Why, then, my lord, give me but leave to speak.
_E. Mor._ But, nephew, do not play the sophister.
_Y. Mor._ This which I urge is of a burning zeal
   To mend the king and do our country good.
   Know you not Gaveston hath store of gold,
   Which may in Ireland purchase him such friends
   As he will front the mightiest of us all?
   And whereas he shall live and be belov'd,
   'Tis hard for us to work his overthrow.
_War._ Mark you but that, my lord of Lancaster.
_Y. Mor._ But, were he here, detested as he is,
   How easily might some base slave be suborn'd
   To greet his lordship with a poniard,
   And none so much as blame the murderer,
   But rather praise him for that brave attempt,
   And in the chronicle enrol his name
   For purging of the realm of such a plague!
_Pem._ He saith true.
_Lan._ Ay, but how chance this was not done before?
_Y. Mor._ Because, my lords, it was not thought upon.
   Nay, more, when he shall know it lies in us
   To banish him, and then to call him home,
   'Twill make him vail the top flag of his pride,
   And fear to offend the meanest nobleman.
_E. Mor._ But how if he do not, nephew?
_Y. Mor._ Then may we with some colour rise in arms;
   For, howsoever we have borne it out,
   'Tis treason to be up against the king;
   So shall we have the people of our side,
   Which, for his father's sake, lean to the king,
   But cannot brook a night-grown mushroom,
   Such a one as my Lord of Cornwall is,
   Should bear us down of the nobility:
   And, when the commons and the nobles join,
   'Tis not the king can buckler Gaveston;
   We'll pull him from the strongest hold he hath.
   My lords, if to perform this I be slack,
   Think me as base a groom as Gaveston.
_Lan._ On that condition Lancaster will grant.
_War._ And so will Pembroke and I.
_E. Mor._ And I.
_Y. Mor._ In this I count me highly gratified,
   And Mortimer will rest at your command.
_Q. Isab._ And when this favour Isabel forgets,
   Then let her live abandon'd and forlorn.--
   But see, in happy time, my lord the king,
   Having brought the Earl of Cornwall on his way,
   Is new return'd.  This news will glad him much:
   Yet not so much as me; I love him more
   Than he can Gaveston: would he lov'd me
   But half so much! then were I treble-blest.

           _Re-enter_ KING EDWARD, _mourning._

_K. Edw._ He's gone, and for his absence thus I mourn:
   Did never sorrow go so near my heart
   As doth the want of my sweet Gaveston;
   And, could my crown's revenue bring him back,
   I would freely give it to his enemies,
   And think I gain'd, having bought so dear a friend.
_Q. Isab._ Hark, how he harps upon his minion!
_K. Edw._ My heart is as an anvil unto sorrow,
   Which beats upon it like the Cyclops' hammers,
   And with the noise turns up my giddy brain,
   And makes me frantic for my Gaveston.
   Ah, had some bloodless Fury rose from hell,
   And with my kingly sceptre struck me dead,
   When I was forc'd to leave my Gaveston!
_Lan. Diablo,_ what passions call you these?
_Q. Isab._ My gracious lord, I come to bring you news.
_K. Edw._ That you have parled with your Mortimer?
_Q. Isab._ That Gaveston, my lord, shall be repeal'd.
_K. Edw._ Repeal'd! the news is too sweet to be true.
_Q. Isab._ But will you love me, if you find it so?
_K. Edw._ If it be so, what will not Edward do?
_Q. Isab._ For Gaveston, but not for Isabel.
_K. Edw._ For thee, fair queen, if thou lov'st Gaveston;
   I'll hang a golden tongue about thy neck,
   Seeing thou hast pleaded with so good success.
_Q. Isab._ No other jewels hang about my neck
   Than these, my lord; nor let me have more wealth
   Than I may fetch from this rich treasury.
   O, how a kiss revives poor Isabel!
_K. Edw._ Once more receive my hand; and let this be
   A second marriage 'twixt thyself and me.
_Q. Isab._ And may it prove more happy than the first!
   My gentle lord, bespeak these nobles fair,
   That wait attendance for a gracious look,
   And on their knees salute your majesty.
_K. Edw._ Courageous Lancaster, embrace thy king;
   And, as gross vapours perish by the sun,
   Even so let hatred with thy sovereign's smile:
   Live thou with me as my companion.
_Lan._ This salutation overjoys my heart.
_K. Edw._ Warwick shall be my chiefest counsellor:
   These silver hairs will more adorn my court
   Than gaudy silks or rich embroidery.
   Chide me, sweet Warwick, if I go astray.
_War._ Slay me, my lord, when I offend your grace.
_K. Edw._ In solemn triumphs and in public shows
   Pembroke shall bear the sword before the king.
_Pem._ And with this sword Pembroke will fight for you.
_K. Edw._ But wherefore walks young Mortimer aside?
   Be thou commander of our royal fleet;
   Or, if that lofty office like thee not,
   I make thee here Lord Marshal of the realm.
_Y. Mor._ My lord, I'll marshal so your enemies,
   As England shall be quiet, and you safe.
_K. Edw._ And as for you, Lord Mortimer of Chirke,
   Whose great achievements in our foreign war
   Deserve no common place nor mean reward,
   Be you the general of the levied troops
   That now are ready to assail the Scots.
_E. Mor._ In this your grace hath highly honour'd me,
   For with my nature war doth best agree.
_Q. Isab._ Now is the king of England rich and strong,
   Having the love of his renowmed peers.
_K. Edw._ Ay, Isabel, ne'er was my heart so light.--
   Clerk of the crown, direct our warrant forth,
   For Gaveston, to Ireland!

              _Enter_ BEAUMONT _with warrant._

                               Beaumont, fly
   As fast as Iris or Jove's Mercury.
_Beau._ It shall be done, my gracious lord.                      [_Exit._
_K. Edw._ Lord Mortimer, we leave you to your charge.
   Now let us in, and feast it royally.
   Against our friend the Earl of Cornwall comes
   We'll have a general tilt and tournament;
   And then his marriage shall be solemnis'd;
   For wot you not that I have made him sure
   Unto our cousin, the Earl of Glocester's heir?
_Lan._ Such news we hear, my lord.
_K. Edw._ That day, if not for him, yet for my sake,
   Who in the triumph will be challenger,
   Spare for no cost; we will requite your love.
_War._ In this or aught your highness shall command us.
_K. Edw._ Thanks, gentle Warwick.  Come, lets in and revel.
                           [_Exeunt all except the elder Mortimer and the
                              younger Mortimer._
_E. Mor._ Nephew, I must to Scotland; thou stay'st here.
   Leave now to oppose thyself against the king:
   Thou seest by nature he is mild and calm;
   And, seeing his mind so dotes on Gaveston,
   Let him without controlment have his will.
   The mightiest kings have had their minions;
   Great Alexander lov'd Hephæstion,
   The conquering Hercules for Hylas wept,
   And for Patroclus stern Achilles droop'd
   And not kings only, but the wisest men;
   The Roman Tully lov'd Octavius,
   Grave Socrates wild Alcibiades.
   Then let his grace, whose youth is flexible,
   And promiseth as much as we can wish,
   Freely enjoy that vain light-headed earl;
   For riper years will wean him from such toys.
_Y. Mor._ Uncle, his wanton humour grieves not me;
   But this I scorn, that one so basely-born
   Should by his sovereign's favour grow so pert,
   And riot it with the treasure of the realm,
   While soldiers mutiny for want of pay.
   He wears a lord's revenue on his back,
   And, Midas-like, he jets it in the court,
   With base outlandish cullions at his heels,
   Whose proud fantastic liveries make such show
   As if that Proteus, god of shapes, appear'd.
   I have not seen a dapper Jack so brisk:
   He wears a short Italian hooded cloak,
   Larded with pearl, and in his Tuscan cap
   A jewel of more value than the crown.
   While others walk below, the king and he,
   From out a window, laugh at such as we,
   And flout our train, and jest at our attire.
   Uncle, 'tis this that makes me impatient.
_E. Mor._ But, nephew, now you see the king is chang'd.
_Y. Mor._ Then so I am, and live to do him service:
   But, whiles I have a sword, a hand, a heart,
   I will not yield to any such upstart.
   You know my mind: come, uncle, let's away.                  [_Exeunt._

        _Enter the younger_ SPENSER _and_ BALDOCK.

_Bald._ Spenser,
   Seeing that our lord the Earl of Glocester's dead,
   Which of the nobles dost thou mean to serve?
_Y. Spen._ Not Mortimer, nor any of his side,
   Because the king and he are enemies.
   Baldock, learn this of me: a factious lord
   Shall hardly do himself good, much less us;
   But he that hath the favour of a king
   May with one word advance us while we live.
   The liberal Earl of Cornwall is the man
   On whose good fortune Spenser's hope depends.
_Bald._ What, mean you, then, to be his follower?
_Y. Spen._ No, his companion; for he loves me well,
   And would have once preferr'd me to the king.
_Bald._ But he is banish'd; there's small hope of him.
_Y. Spen._ Ay, for a while; but, Baldock, mark the end.
   A friend of mine told me in secrecy
   That he's repeal'd and sent for back again;
   And even now a post came from the court
   With letters to our lady from the king;
   And, as she read, she smil'd; which makes me think
   It is about her lover Gaveston.
_Bald._ 'Tis like enough; for, since he was exil'd,
   She neither walks abroad nor comes in sight.
   But I had thought the match had been broke off,
   And that his banishment had chang'd her mind.
_Y. Spen._ Our lady's first love is not wavering;
   My life for thine, she will have Gaveston.
_Bald._ Then hope I by her means to be preferr'd,
   Having read unto her since she was a child.
_Y. Spen._ Then, Baldock, you must cast the scholar off,
   And learn to court it like a gentleman.
   'Tis not a black coat and a little band,
   A velvet-cap'd cloak, fac'd before with serge,
   And smelling to a nosegay all the day,
   Or holding of a napkin in your hand,
   Or saying a long grace at a table's end,
   Or making low legs to a nobleman,
   Or looking downward, with your eye-lids close,
   And saying, "Truly, an't may please your honour,"
   Can get you any favour with great men:
   You must be proud, bold, pleasant, resolute,
   And now and then stab, as occasion serves.
_Bald._ Spenser, thou know'st I hate such formal toys,
   And use them but of mere hypocrisy.
   Mine old lord, whiles he liv'd, was so precise,
   That he would take exceptions at my buttons,
   And, being like pins' heads, blame me for the bigness;
   Which made me curate-like in mine attire,
   Though inwardly licentious enough,
   And apt for any kind of villany.
   I am none of these common pedants, I,
   That cannot speak without _propterea quod._
_Y. Spen._ But one of those that saith _quando-quidem,_
   And hath a special gift to form a verb.
_Bald._ Leave off this jesting; here my lady comes.

               _Enter_ KING EDWARD'S Niece.

_Niece._ The grief for his exile was not so much
   As is the joy of his returning home.
   This letter came from my sweet Gaveston:
   What need'st thou, love, thus to excuse thyself?
   I know thou couldst not come and visit me.                   [_Reads._
   _I will not long be from thee, though I die;--_
   This argues the entire love of my lord;--                    [_Reads._
   _When I forsake thee, death seize on my heart!--_
   But stay thee here where Gaveston shall sleep.
                                       [_Puts the letter into her bosom._
   Now to the letter of my lord the king:
   He wills me to repair unto the court,
   And meet my Gaveston: why do I stay,
   Seeing that he talks thus of my marriage day?--
   Who's there?  Baldock!
   See that my coach be ready; I must hence.
_Bald._ It shall be done, madam.
_Niece._ And meet me at the park-pale presently          [_Exit Baldock._
   Spenser, stay you, and bear me company,
   For I have joyful news to tell thee of;
   My lord of Cornwall is a-coming over,
   And will be at the court as soon as we.
_Y. Spen._ I knew the king would have him home again.
_Niece._ If all things sort out, as I hope they will,
   Thy service, Spenser, shall be thought upon.
_Y. Spen._ I humbly thank your ladyship.
_Niece._ Come, lead the way: I long till I am there.           [_Exeunt._

_Enter_ KING EDWARD, QUEEN ISABELLA, KENT, LANCASTER,
     _the younger_ MORTIMER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _and_
     Attendants.

_K. Edw._ The wind is good; I wonder why he stays:
   I fear me he is wreck'd upon the sea.
_Q. Isab._ Look, Lancaster, how passionate he is,
   And still his mind runs on his minion!
_Lan._ My lord,--
_K. Edw._ How now! what news? is Gaveston arriv'd?
_Y. Mor._ Nothing but Gaveston! what means your grace?
   You have matters of more weight to think upon:
   The King of France sets foot in Normandy.
_K. Edw._ A trifle! we'll expel him when we please.
   But tell me, Mortimer, what's thy device
   Against the stately triumph we decreed?
_Y. Mor._ A homely one, my lord, not worth the telling.
_K. Edw._ Pray thee, let me know it.
_Y. Mor._ But, seeing you are so desirous, thus it is;
   A lofty cedar tree, fair flourishing,
   On whose top branches kingly eagles perch,
   And by the bark a canker creeps me up,
   And gets unto the highest bough of all;
   The motto, _Æque tandem._
_K. Edw._ And what is yours, my Lord of Lancaster?
_Lan._ My lord, mine's more obscure than Mortimer's.
   Pliny reports, there is a flying-fish
   Which all the other fishes deadly hate,
   And therefore, being pursu'd, it takes the air:
   No sooner is it up, but there's a fowl
   That seizeth it: this fish, my lord, I bear;
   The motto this, _Undique mors est._
_Kent._ Proud Mortimer! ungentle Lancaster!
   Is this the love you bear your sovereign?
   Is this the fruit your reconcilement bears?
   Can you in words make show of amity,
   And in your shields display your rancorous minds?
   What call you this but private libelling
   Against the Earl of Cornwall and my brother?
_Q. Isab._ Sweet husband, be content; they all love you.
_K. Edw._ They love me not that hate my Gaveston.
   I am that cedar; shake me not too much;
   And you the eagles; soar ye ne'er so high,
   I have the jesses that will pull you down;
   And _Æque tandem_ shall that canker cry
   Unto the proudest peer of Britainy.
   Thou that compar'st him to a flying-fish,
   And threaten'st death whether he rise or fall,
   'Tis not the hugest monster of the sea,
   Nor foulest harpy, that shall swallow him.
_Y. Mor._ If in his absence thus he favours him,
   What will he do whenas he shall be present?
_Lan._ That shall we see: look, where his lordship come!

                   _Enter_ GAVESTON.

_K. Edw._ My Gaveston!
   Welcome to Tynmouth! welcome to thy friend!
   Thy absence made me droop and pine away;
   For, as the lovers of fair Danaë,
   When she was lock'd up in a brazen tower,
   Desir'd her more, and wax'd outrageous,
   So did it fare with me: and now thy sight
   Is sweeter far than was thy parting hence
   Bitter and irksome to my sobbing heart.
_Gav._ Sweet lord and king, your speech preventeth mine;
   Yet have I words left to express my joy:
   The shepherd, nipt with biting winter's rage,
   Frolics not more to see the painted spring
   Than I do to behold your majesty.
_K. Edw._ Will none of you salute my Gaveston?
_Lan._ Salute him! yes.--Welcome, Lord Chamberlain!
_Y. Mor._ Welcome is the good Earl of Cornwall!
_War._ Welcome, Lord Governor of the Isle of Man!
_Pem._ Welcome, Master Secretary!
_Kent._ Brother, do you hear them?
_K. Edw._ Still will these earls and barons use me thus?
_Gav._ My lord, I cannot brook these injuries.
_Q. Isab._ Ay me, poor soul, when these begin to jar!           [_Aside._
_K. Edw._ Return it to their throats; I'll be thy warrant.
_Gav._ Base, leaden earls, that glory in your birth,
   Go sit at home, and eat your tenants' beef;
   And come not here to scoff at Gaveston,
   Whose mounting thoughts did never creep so low
   As to bestow a look on such as you.
_Lan._ Yet I disdain not to do this for you.
                         [_Draws his sword, and offers to stab Gaveston._
_K. Edw._ Treason! treason! where's the traitor?
_Pem._ Here, here!
_K. Edw._ Convey hence Gaveston; they'll murder him.
_Gav._ The life of thee shall salve this foul disgrace.
_Y. Mor._ Villain, thy life! unless I miss mine aim.  [_Wounds Gaveston._
_Q. Isab._ Ah, furious Mortimer, what hast thou done.
_Y. Mor._ No more than I would answer, were he slain.
                                        [_Exit Gaveston with Attendants._
_K. Edw._ Yes, more than thou canst answer, though he live:
   Dear shall you both abide this riotous deed:
   Out of my presence! come not near the court.
_Y. Mor._ I'll not be barr'd the court for Gaveston.
_Lan._ We'll hale him by the ears unto the block.
_K. Edw._ Look to your own heads; his is sure enough.
_War._ Look to your own crown, if you back him thus.
_Kent._ Warwick, these words do ill beseem thy years.
_K. Edw._ Nay, all of them conspire to cross me thus:
   But, if I live, I'll tread upon their heads
   That think with high looks thus to tread me down.
   Come, Edmund, let's away, and levy men:
   'Tis war that must abate these barons' pride.
                         [_Exeunt King Edward, Queen Isabella, and Kent._
_War._ Let's to our castles, for the king is mov'd.
_Y. Mor._ Mov'd may he be, and perish in his wrath!
_Lan._ Cousin, it is no dealing with him now;
   He means to make us stoop by force of arms:
   And therefore let us jointly here protest
   To prosecute that Gaveston to the death.
_Y. Mor._ By heaven, the abject villain shall not live!
_War._ I'll have his blood, or die in seeking it.
_Pem._ The like oath Pembroke takes.
_Lan._ And so doth Lancaster.
   Now send our heralds to defy the king;
   And make the people swear to put him down.

                     _Enter a_ Messenger.

_Y. Mor._ Letters! from whence?
_Mes._ From Scotland, my lord.             [_Giving letters to Mortimer._
_Lan._ Why, how now, cousin! how fare all our friends?
_Y. Mor._ My uncle's taken prisoner by the Scots.
_Lan._ We'll have him ransom'd, man: be of good cheer.
_Y. Mor._ They rate his ransom at five thousand pound.
   Who should defray the money but the king,
   Seeing he is taken prisoner in his wars?
   I'll to the king.
_Lan._ Do, cousin, and I'll bear thee company.
_War._ Meantime my Lord of Pembroke and myself
   Will to Newcastle here, and gather head.
_Y. Mor._ About it, then, and we will follow you.
_Lan._ Be resolute and full of secrecy.
_War._ I warrant you.                              [_Exit with Pembroke._
_Y. Mor._ Cousin, an if he will not ransom him,
   I'll thunder such a peal into his ears
   As never subject did unto his king.
_Lan._ Content; I'll bear my part.--Hollo! who's there?

                       _Enter_ Guard.

_Y. Mor._ Ay, marry, such a guard as this doth well.
_Lan._ Lead on the way.
_Guard._ Whither will your lordships?
_Y. Mor._ Whither else but to the king?
_Guard._ His highness is dispos'd to be alone.
_Lan._ Why, so he may; but we will speak to him.
_Guard._ You may not in, my lord.
_Y. Mor._ May we not?

           _Enter_ KING EDWARD _and_ KENT.

_K. Edw._ How now!
   What noise is this? who have we here? is't you?              [_Going._
_Y. Mor._ Nay, stay, my lord; I come to bring you news;
   Mine uncle's taken prisoner by the Scots.
_K. Edw._ Then ransom him.
_Lan._ 'Twas in your wars; you should ransom him.
_Y. Mor._ And you will ransom him, or else--
_Kent._ What, Mortimer, you will not threaten him?
_K. Edw._ Quiet yourself; you shall have the broad seal,
   To gather for him th[o]roughout the realm.
_Lan._ Your minion Gaveston hath taught you this.
_Y. Mor._ My lord, the family of the Mortimers
   Are not so poor, but, would they sell their land,
   'Twould levy men enough to anger you.
   We never beg, but use such prayers as these.
_K. Edw._ Shall I still be haunted thus?
_Y. Mor._ Nay, now you are here alone, I'll speak my mind.
_Lan._ And so will I; and then, my lord, farewell.
_Y. Mor._ The idle triumphs, masks, lascivious shows,
   And prodigal gifts bestow'd on Gaveston,
   Have drawn thy treasury dry, and made thee weak;
   The murmuring commons, overstretched, break.
_Lan._ Look for rebellion, look to be depos'd:
   Thy garrisons are beaten out of France,
   And, lame and poor, lie groaning at the gates;
   The wild Oneil, with swarms of Irish kerns,
   Lives uncontroll'd within the English pale;
   Unto the walls of York the Scots make road,
   And, unresisted, drive away rich spoils.
_Y. Mor._ The haughty Dane commands the narrow seas,
   While in the harbour ride thy ships unrigg'd.
_Lan._ What foreign prince sends thee ambassadors?
_Y. Mor._ Who loves thee, but a sort of flatterers?
_Lan._ Thy gentle queen, sole sister to Valois,
   Complains that thou hast left her all forlorn.
_Y. Mor._ Thy court is naked, being bereft of those
   That make a king seem glorious to the world,
   I mean the peers, whom thou shouldst dearly love;
   Libels are cast against thee in the street;
   Ballads and rhymes made of thy overthrow.
_Lan._ The northern borderers, seeing their houses burnt,
   Their wives and children slain, run up and down,
   Cursing the name of thee and Gaveston.
_Y. Mor._ When wert thou in the field with banner spread,
   But once? and then thy soldiers march'd like players,
   With garish robes, not armour; and thyself,
   Bedaub'd with gold, rode laughing at the rest,
   Nodding and shaking of thy spangled crest,
   Where women's favours hung like labels down.
_Lan._ And thereof came it that the fleering Scots,
   To England's high disgrace, have made this jig;
   _Maids of England, sore may you mourn,
   For your lemans you have lost at Bannocksbourn,--
   With a heave and a ho!
   What weeneth the king of England
   So soon to have won Scotland!--
   With a rombelow!_
_Y. Mor._ Wigmore shall fly, to set my uncle free.
_Lan._ And, when 'tis gone, our swords shall purchase more.
   If you be mov'd, revenge it as you can:
   Look next to see us with our ensigns spread.  [_Exit with Y. Mortimer._
_K. Edw._ My swelling heart for very anger breaks:
   How oft have I been baited by these peers,
   And dare not be reveng'd, for their power is great!
   Yet, shall the crowning of these cockerels
   Affright a lion?  Edward, unfold thy paws,
   And let their lives'-blood slake thy fury's hunger.
   If I be cruel and grow tyrannous,
   Now let them thank themselves, and rue too late.
_Kent._ My lord, I see your love to Gaveston
   Will be the ruin of the realm and you,
   For now the wrathful nobles threaten wars;
   And therefore, brother, banish him for ever.
_K. Edw._ Art thou an enemy to my Gaveston?
_Kent._ Ay; and it grieves me that I favour'd him.
_K. Edw._ Traitor, be gone! whine thou with Mortimer.
_Kent._ So will I, rather than with Gaveston.
_K. Edw._ Out of my sight, and trouble me no more!
_Kent._ No marvel though thou scorn thy noble peers,
   When I thy brother am rejected thus.
_K. Edw._ Away!                                             [_Exit Kent._
   Poor Gaveston, thou hast no friend but me!
   Do what they can, we'll live in Tynmouth here;
   And, so I walk with him about the walls,
   What care I though the earls begirt us round?
   Here comes she that is cause of all these jars.

_Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA, _with_ EDWARD'S NIECE, _two_ Ladies,
       GAVESTON, BALDOCK, _and the younger_ SPENSER.

_Q. Isab._ My lord, 'tis thought the earls are up in arms.
_K. Edw._ Ay, and 'tis likewise thought you favour 'em.
_Q. Isab._ Thus do you still suspect me without cause.
_Niece._ Sweet uncle, speak more kindly to the queen.
_Gav._ My lord, dissemble with her; speak her fair.
_K. Edw._ Pardon me, sweet; I forgot myself.
_Q. Isab._ Your pardon is quickly got of Isabel.
_K. Edw._ The younger Mortimer is grown so brave,
   That to my face he threatens civil wars.
_Gav._ Why do you not commit him to the Tower?
_K. Edw._ I dare not, for the people love him well.
_Gav._ Why, then, we'll have him privily made away.
_K. Edw._ Would Lancaster and he had both carous'd
   A bowl of poison to each other's health!
   But let them go, and tell me what are these.
_Niece._ Two of my father's servants whilst he liv'd:
   May't please your grace to entertain them now.
_K. Edw._ Tell me, where wast thou born? what is thine arms?
_Bald._ My name is Baldock, and my gentry
   I fetch from Oxford, not from heraldry.
_K. Edw._ The fitter art thou, Baldock, for my turn.
   Wait on me, and I'll see thou shalt not want.
_Bald._ I humbly thank your majesty.
_K. Edw._ Knowest thou him, Gaveston.
_Gav._ Ay, my lord;
   His name is Spenser; he is well allied:
   For my sake let him wait upon your grace;
   Scarce shall you find a man of more desert.
_K. Edw._ Then, Spenser, wait upon me for his sake:
   I'll grace thee with a higher style ere long.
_Y. Spen._ No greater titles happen unto me
   Than to be favour'd of your majesty!
_K. Edw._ Cousin, this day shall be your marriage feast:--
   And, Gaveston, think that I love thee well,
   To wed thee to our niece, the only heir
   Unto the Earl of Glocester late deceas'd.
_Gav._ I know, my lord, many will stomach me;
   But I respect neither their love nor hate.
_K. Edw._ The headstrong barons shall not limit me;
   He that I list to favour shall be great.
   Come, let's away; and, when the marriage ends,
   Have at the rebels and their complices!                     [_Exeunt._

      _Enter_ KENT, LANCASTER, _the younger_ MORTIMER,
              WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _and others._

_Kent._ My lords, of love to this our native land,
   I come to join with you, and leave the king;
   And in your quarrel, and the realm's behoof,
   Will be the first that shall adventure life.
_Lan._ I fear me, you are sent of policy,
   To undermine us with a show of love.
_War._ He is your brother; therefore have we cause
   To cast the worst, and doubt of your revolt.
_Kent._ Mine honour shall be hostage of my truth:
   If that will not suffice, farewell, my lords.
_Y. Mor._ Stay, Edmund: never was Plantagenet
   False of his word; and therefore trust we thee.
_Pem._ But what's the reason you should leave him now?
_Kent._ I have inform'd the Earl of Lancaster.
_Lan._ And it sufficeth.  Now, my lords, know this,
   That Gaveston is secretly arriv'd,
   And here in Tynmouth frolics with the king.
   Let us with these our followers scale the walls,
   And suddenly surprise them unawares.
_Y. Mor._ I'll give the onset.
_War._ And I'll follow thee.
_Y. Mor._ This tatter'd ensign of my ancestors,
   Which swept the desert shore of that Dead Sea
   Whereof we got the name of Mortimer,
   Will I advance upon this castle ['s] walls--
   Drums, strike alarum, raise them from their sport,
   And ring aloud the knell of Gaveston!
_Lan._ None be so hardy as to touch the king;
   But neither spare you Gaveston nor his friends.             [_Exeunt._

   _Enter, severally_ KING EDWARD _and the younger_
                        SPENSER.

_K. Edw._ O, tell me, Spenser, where is Gaveston?
_Y. Spen._ I fear me he is slain, my gracious lord.
_K. Edw._ No, here he comes; now let them spoil and kill.

     _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA, KING EDWARD'S Niece,
                GAVESTON, _and_ Nobles.

   Fly, fly, my lords; the earls have got the hold;
   Take shipping, and away to Scarborough:
   Spenser and I will post away by land.
_Gav._ O, stay, my lord! they will not injure you.
_K. Edw._ I will not trust them.  Gaveston, away!
_Gav._ Farewell, my lord.
_K. Edw._ Lady, farewell.
_Niece._ Farewell, sweet uncle, till we meet again.
_K. Edw._ Farewell, sweet Gaveston; and farewell, niece.
_Q. Isab._ No farewell to poor Isabel thy queen?
_K. Edw._ Yes, yes, for Mortimer your lover's sake.
_Q. Isab._ Heavens can witness, I love none but you.
                                     [_Exeunt all except Queen Isabella._
   From my embracements thus he breaks away.
   O, that mine arms could close this isle about,
   That I might pull him to me where I would!
   Or that these tears, that drizzle from mine eyes,
   Had power to mollify his stony heart,
   That, when I had him, we might never part!

_Enter_ LANCASTER, WARWICK, _the younger_ MORTIMER, _and
                 others.  Alarums within._

_Lan._ I wonder how he scap'd.
_Y. Mor._ Who's this? the queen!
_Q. Isab._ Ay, Mortimer, the miserable queen,
   Whose pining heart her inward sighs have blasted,
   And body with continual mourning wasted:
   These hands are tir'd with haling of my lord
   From Gaveston, from wicked Gaveston;
   And all in vain; for, when I speak him fair,
   He turns away, and smiles upon his minion.
_Y. Mor._ Cease to lament, and tell us where's the king?
_Q. Isab._ What would you with the king? is't him you seek?
_Lan._ No, madam, but that cursed Gaveston:
   Far be it from the thought of Lancaster
   To offer violence to his sovereign!
   We would but rid the realm of Gaveston:
   Tell us where he remains, and he shall die.
_Q. Isab._ He's gone by water unto Scarborough:
   Pursue him quickly, and he cannot scape;
   The king hath left him, and his train is small.
_War._ Forslow no time, sweet Lancaster; let's march.
_Y. Mor._ How comes it that the king and he is parted?
_Q. Isab._ That thus your army, going several ways,
   Might be of lesser force, and with the power
   That he intendeth presently to raise,
   Be easily suppress'd: therefore be gone.
_Y. Mor._ Here in the river rides a Flemish hoy:
   Let's all aboard, and follow him amain.
_Lan._ The wind that bears him hence will fill our sails;
   Come, come, aboard! 'tis but an hour's sailing.
_Y. Mor._ Madam, stay you within this castle here.
_Q. Isab._ No, Mortimer; I'll to my lord the king.
_Y. Mor._ Nay, rather sail with us to Scarborough.
_Q. Isab._ You know the king is so suspicious
   As, if he hear I have but talk'd with you,
   Mine honour will be call'd in question;
   And therefore, gentle Mortimer, be gone.
_Y. Mor._ Madam, I cannot stay to answer you:
   But think of Mortimer as he deserves.
                                     [_Exeunt all except Queen Isabella._
_Q. Isab._ So well hast thou deserv'd, sweet Mortimer,
   As Isabel could live with thee for ever.
   In vain I look for love at Edward's hand,
   Whose eyes are fix'd on none but Gaveston.
   Yet once more I'll importune him with prayer:
   If he be strange, and not regard my words,
   My son and I will over into France,
   And to the king my brother there complain
   How Gaveston hath robb'd me of his love:
   But yet, I hope, my sorrows will have end,
   And Gaveston this blessed day be slain.                       [_Exit._

                   _Enter_ GAVESTON, _pursued._

_Gav._ Yet, lusty lords, I have escap'd your hands,
   Your threats, your 'larums, and your hot pursuits;
   And, though divorced from King Edward's eyes,
   Yet liveth Pierce of Gaveston unsurpris'd,
   Breathing in hope (malgrado all your beards,
   That muster rebels thus against your king)
   To see his royal sovereign once again.

_Enter_ WARWICK, LANCASTER, PEMBROKE, _the younger_
     MORTIMER, Soldiers, JAMES _and other_ Attendants _of_
     PENBROKE.

_War._ Upon him, soldiers! take away his weapons!
_Y. Mor._ Thou proud disturber of thy country's peace,
   Corrupter of thy king, cause of these broils,
   Base flatterer, yield! and, were it not for shame,
   Shame and dishonour to a soldier's name,
   Upon my weapon's point here shouldst thou fall,
   And welter in thy gore.
_Lan._ Monster of men,
   That, like the Greekish strumpet, train'd to arms
   And bloody wars so many valiant knights,
   Look for no other fortune, wretch, than death!
   King Edward is not here to buckler thee.
_War._ Lancaster, why talk'st thou to the slave?--
   Go, soldiers, take him hence; for, by my sword,
   His head shall off.--Gaveston, short warning
   Shall serve thy turn: it is our country's cause
   That here severely we will execute
   Upon thy person.--Hang him at a bough.
_Gav._ My lord,--
_War._ Soldiers, have him away.--
   But, for thou wert the favourite of a king,
   Thou shalt have so much honour at our hands.
_Gav._ I thank you all, my lords: then I perceive
   That heading is one, and hanging is the other,
   And death is all.

                    _Enter_ ARUNDEL.

_Lan._ How now, my Lord of Arundel!
_Arun._ My lords, King Edward greets you all by me.
_War._ Arundel, say your message.
_Arun._ His majesty, hearing that you had taken Gaveston,
   Entreateth you by me, yet but he may
   See him before he dies; for why, he says,
   And sends you word, he knows that die he shall;
   And, if you gratify his grace so far,
   He will be mindful of the courtesy.
_War._ How now!
_Gav._ Renowmed Edward, how thy name
   Revives poor Gaveston!
_War._ No, it needeth not:
   Arundel, we will gratify the king
   In other matters; he must pardon us in this.--
   Soldiers, away with him!
_Gav._ Why, my Lord of Warwick,
   Will now these short delays beget my hopes?
   I know it, lords, it is life you aim at,
   Yet grant King Edward this.
_Y. Mor._ Shalt thou appoint
   What we shall grant?--Soldiers, away with him!--
   Thus we'll gratify the king;
   We'll send his head by thee; let him bestow
   His tears on that, for that is all he gets
   Of Gaveston, or else his senseless trunk.
_Lan._ Not so, my lord, lest he bestow more cost
   In burying him than he hath ever earn'd.
_Arun._ My lords, it is his majesty's request,
   And in the honour of a king he swears,
   He will but talk with him, and send him back.
_War._ When, can you tell?  Arundel, no; we wot
   He that the care of his realm remits,
   And drives his nobles to these exigents
   For Gaveston, will, if he seize him once,
   Violate any promise to possess him.
_Arun._ Then, if you will not trust his grace in keep,
   My lords, I will be pledge for his return.
_Y. Mor._ 'Tis honourable in thee to offer this;
   But, for we know thou art a noble gentleman,
   We will not wrong thee so,
   To make away a true man for a thief.
_Gav._ How mean'st thou, Mortimer? that is over-base.
_Y. Mor._ Away, base groom, robber of king's renown!
   Question with thy companions and mates.
_Pem._ My Lord Mortimer, and you, my lords, each one,
   To gratify the king's request therein,
   Touching the sending of this Gaveston,
   Because his majesty so earnestly
   Desires to see the man before his death,
   I will upon mine honour undertake
   To carry him, and bring him back again;
   Provided this, that you, my Lord of Arundel,
   Will join with me.
_War._ Pembroke, what wilt thou do?
   Cause yet more bloodshed? is it not enough
   That we have taken him, but must we now
   Leave him on "Had I wist," and let him go?
_Pem._ My lords, I will not over-woo your honours:
   But, if you dare trust Pembroke with the prisoner,
   Upon mine oath, I will return him back.
_Arun._ My Lord of Lancaster, what say you in this?
_Lan._ Why, I say, let him go on Pembroke's word.
_Pem._ And you, Lord Mortimer?
_Y. Mor._ How say you, my Lord of Warwick?
_War._ Nay, do your pleasures: I know how 'twill prove.
_Pem._ Then give him me.
_Gav._ Sweet sovereign, yet I come
   To see thee ere I die!
_War._ Yet not perhaps,
   If Warwick's wit and policy prevail.                         [_Aside._
_Y. Mor._ My Lord of Pembroke, we deliver him you:
   Return him on your honour.--Sound, away!
                   [_Exeunt all except Pembroke, Arundel, Gaveston, James
                       and other attendants of Pembroke._
_Pem._ My lord, you shall go with me:
   My house is not far hence; out of the way
   A little; but our men shall go along.
   We that have pretty wenches to our wives,
   Sir, must not come so near to balk their lips.
_Arun._ 'Tis very kindly spoke, my Lord of Pembroke:
   Your honour hath an adamant of power
   To draw a prince.
_Pem._ So, my lord.--Come hither, James:
   I do commit this Gaveston to thee;
   Be thou this night his keeper; in the morning
   We will discharge thee of thy charge: be gone.
_Gav._ Unhappy Gaveston, whither go'st thou now?
                     [_Exit with James and other Attendants of Pembroke._
_Horse-boy._ My lord, we'll quickly be at Cobham.              [_Exeunt._

  _Enter_ GAVESTON _mourning,_ JAMES _and other_ Attendants
                        _of_ PEMBROKE.

_Gav._ O treacherous Warwick, thus to wrong thy friend!
_James._ I see it is your life these arms pursue.
_Gav._ Weaponless must I fall, and die in bands?
   O, must this day be period of my life,
   Centre of all my bliss?  And ye be men,
   Speed to the king.

             _Enter_ WARWICK _and_ Soldiers.

_War._ My Lord of Pembroke's men,
   Strive you no longer: I will have that Gaveston.
_James._ Your lordship doth dishonour to yourself,
   And wrong our lord, your honourable friend.
_War._ No, James, it is my country's cause I follow.--
   Go, take the villain: soldiers, come away;
   We'll make quick work.--Commend me to your master,
   My friend, and tell him that I watch'd it well.--
   Come, let thy shadow parley with King Edward.
_Gav._ Treacherous earl, shall I not see the king?
_War._ The king of heaven perhaps, no other king.--
   Away!                    [_Exeunt Warwick and Soldiers with Gaveston._
_James._ Come, fellows: it booted not for us to strive:
   We will in haste go certify our lord.                       [_Exeunt._

_Enter_ KING EDWARD, _the younger_ SPENSER, BALDOCK, Noblemen
  _of the king's side, and_ Soldiers _with drums and fifes._

_K. Edw._ I long to hear an answer from the barons
   Touching my friend, my dearest Gaveston.
   Ah, Spenser, not the riches of my realm
   Can ransom him! ah, he is mark'd to die!
   I know the malice of the younger Mortimer;
   Warwick I know is rough, and Lancaster
   Inexorable; and I shall never see
   My lovely Pierce of Gaveston again:
   The barons overbear with me their pride.
_Y. Spen._ Were I King Edward, England's sovereign,
   Son to the lovely Eleanor of Spain,
   Great Edward Longshanks' issue, would I bear
   These braves, this rage, and suffer uncontroll'd
   These barons thus to beard me in my land,
   In mine own realm?  My lord, pardon my speech:
   Did you retain your father's magnanimity,
   Did you regard the honour of your name,
   You would not suffer thus your majesty
   Be counterbuff'd of your nobility.
   Strike off their heads, and let them preach on poles:
   No doubt, such lessons they will teach the rest,
   As by their preachments they will profit much,
   And learn obedience to their lawful king.
_K. Edw._ Yes, gentle Spenser, we have been too mild,
   Too kind to them; but now have drawn our sword,
   And, if they send me not my Gaveston,
   We'll steel it on their crest[s], and poll their tops.
_Bald._ This haught resolve becomes your majesty,
   Not to be tied to their affection,
   As though your highness were a school-boy still,
   And must be aw'd and govern'd like a child.

    _Enter the elder_ SPENSER _with his truncheon, and_
                       Soldiers.

_E. Spen._ Long live my sovereign, the noble Edward,
   In peace triumphant, fortunate in wars!
_K. Edw._ Welcome, old man: com'st thou in Edward's aid?
   Then tell thy prince of whence and what thou art.
_E. Spen._ Low, with a band of bow-men and of pikes,
   Brown bills and targeteers, four hundred strong,
   Sworn to defend King Edward's royal right,
   I come in person to your majesty,
   Spenser, the father of Hugh Spenser there,
   Bound to your highness everlastingly
   For favour done, in him, unto us all.
_K. Edw._ Thy father, Spenser?
_Y. Spen._ True, an it like your grace,
   That pours, in lieu of all your goodness shown,
   His life, my lord, before your princely feet.
_K. Edw._ Welcome ten thousand times, old man, again!
   Spenser, this love, this kindness to thy king,
   Argues thy noble mind and disposition.
   Spenser, I here create thee Earl of Wiltshire,
   And daily will enrich thee with our favour,
   That, as the sunshine, shall reflect o'er thee.
   Beside, the more to manifest our love,
   Because we hear Lord Bruce doth sell his land,
   And that the Mortimers are in hand withal,
   Thou shalt have crowns of us t'outbid the barons;
   And, Spenser, spare them not, lay it on.--
   Soldiers, a largess, and thrice-welcome all!
_Y. Spen._ My lord, here comes the queen.

     _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA, PRINCE EDWARD, _and_
                       LEVUNE.

_K. Edw._ Madam, what news?
_Q. Isab._ News of dishonour, lord, and discontent.
   Our friend Levune, faithful and full of trust,
   Informeth us, by letters and by words,
   That Lord Valois our brother, King of France,
   Because your highness hath been slack in homage,
   Hath seized Normandy into his hands:
   These be the letters, this the messenger.
_K. Edw._ Welcome, Levune.--Tush, Sib, if this be all,
   Valois and I will soon be friends again.--
   But to my Gaveston: shall I never see,
   Never behold thee now!--Madam, in this matter
   We will employ you and your little son;
   You shall go parley with the King of France.--
   Boy, see you bear you bravely to the king,
   And do your message with a majesty.
_P. Edw._ Commit not to my youth things of more weight
   Than fits a prince so young as I to bear;
   And fear not, lord and father,--heaven's great beams
   On Atlas' shoulder shall not lie more safe
   Than shall your charge committed to my trust.
_Q. Isab._ Ah, boy, this towardness makes thy mother fear
   Thou art not mark'd to many days on earth!
_K. Edw._ Madam, we will that you with speed be shipp'd,
   And this our son; Levune shall follow you
   With all the haste we can despatch him hence.
   Choose of our lords to bear you company;
   And go in peace; leave us in wars at home.
_Q. Isab._ Unnatural wars, where subjects brave their king:
   God end them once!--My lord, I take my leave,
   To make my preparation for France.         [_Exit with Prince Edward._

                   _Enter_ ARUNDEL.

_K. Edw._ What, Lord Arundel, dost thou come alone?
_Arun._ Yea, my good lord, for Gaveston is dead.
_K. Edw._ Ah, traitors, have they put my friend to death?
   Tell me, Arundel, died he ere thou cam'st,
   Or didst thou see my friend to take his death?
_Arun._ Neither, my lord; for, as he was surpris'd,
   Begirt with weapons and with enemies round,
   I did your highness' message to them all,
   Demanding him of them, entreating rather,
   And said, upon the honour of my name,
   That I would undertake to carry him
   Unto your highness, and to bring him back.
_K. Edw._ And, tell me, would the rebels deny me that?
_Y. Spen._ Proud recreants!
_K. Edw._ Yea, Spenser, traitors all!
_Arun._ In found them at the first inexorable;
   The Earl of Warwick would not bide the hearing,
   Mortimer hardly; Pembroke and Lancaster
   Spake least; and when they flatly had denied,
   Refusing to receive me pledge for him,
   The Earl of Pembroke mildly thus bespake;
   "My lord, because our sovereign sends for him,
   And promiseth he shall be safe return'd,
   I will this undertake, to have him hence,
   And see him re-deliver'd to your hands."
_K. Edw._ Well, and how fortunes [it] that he came not?
_Y. Spen._ Some treason or some villany was cause.
_Arun._ The Earl of Warwick seiz'd him on his way;
   For, being deliver'd unto Pembroke's men,
   Their lord rode home, thinking his prisoner safe;
   But, ere he came, Warwick in ambush lay,
   And bare him to his death; and in a trench
   Strake off his head, and march'd unto the camp.
_Y. Spen._ A bloody part, flatly 'gainst law of arms!
_K. Edw._ O, shall I speak, or shall I sigh and die!
_Y. Spen._ My lord, refer your vengeance to the sword
   Upon these barons; hearten up your men;
   Let them not unreveng'd murder your friends:
   Advance your standard, Edward, in the field,
   And march to fire them from their starting-holes.
_K. Edw._ [_kneeling._] By earth, the common mother of us all,
   By heaven, and all the moving orbs thereof,
   By this right hand, and by my father's sword,
   And all the honours 'longing to my crown,
   I will have heads and lives for him as many
   As I have manors, castles, towns, and towers!--              [_Rises._
   Treacherous Warwick! traitorous Mortimer!
   If I be England's king, in lakes of gore
   Your headless trunks, your bodies will I trail,
   That you may drink your fill, and quaff in blood,
   And stain my royal standard with the same,
   That so my bloody colours may suggest
   Remembrance of revenge immortally
   On your accursed traitorous progeny,
   You villains that have slain my Gaveston!--
   And in this place of honour and of trust,
   Spenser, sweet Spenser, I adopt thee here;
   And merely of our love we do create thee
   Earl of Glocester and Lord Chamberlain,
   Despite of times, despite of enemies.
_Y. Spen._ My lord, here's a messenger from the barons
   Desires access unto your majesty.
_K. Edw._ Admit him near.

             _Enter_ Herald _with his coat of arms._

_Her._ Long live King Edward, England's lawful lord!
_K. Edw._ So wish not they, I wis, that sent thee hither:
   Thou com'st from Mortimer and his complices:
   A ranker rout of rebels never was.
   Well, say thy message.
_Her._ The barons, up in arms, by me salute
   Your highness with long life and happiness;
   And bid me say, as plainer to your grace,
   That if without effusion of blood
   You will this grief have ease and remedy,
   That from your princely person you remove
   This Spenser, as a putrifying branch
   That deads the royal vine, whose golden leaves
   Empale your princely head, your diadem;
   Whose brightness such pernicious upstarts dim,
   Say they, and lovingly advise your grace
   To cherish virtue and nobility,
   And have old servitors in high esteem,
   And shake off smooth dissembling flatterers:
   This granted, they, their honours, and their lives,
   Are to your highness vow'd and consecrate.
_Y. Spen._ Ah, traitors, will they still display their pride?
_K. Edw._ Away! tarry no answer, but be gone!--
   Rebels, will they appoint their sovereign
   His sports, his pleasures, and his company?--
   Yet, ere thou go, see how I do divorce      [_Embraces young Spenser._
   Spenser from thee.  Now get thee to thy lords,
   And tell them I will come to chastise them
   For murdering Gaveston: hie thee, get thee gone!
   Edward, with fire and sword, follows at thy heels.     [_Exit Herald._
   My lord[s], perceive you how these rebels swell?--
   Soldiers, good hearts! defend your sovereign's right,
   For, now, even now, we march to make them stoop.
   Away!

                      [_Exeunt. Alarums, excursions, a great fight, and a
                            retreat sounded, within._

   _Re-enter_ KING EDWARD, _the elder_ SPENSER, _the younger_
     SPENSER, BALDOCK, _and_ Noblemen _of the king's side._

_K. Edw._ Why do we sound retreat? upon them, lords!
   This day I shall your vengeance with my sword
   On those proud rebels that are up in arms,
   And do confront and countermand their king.
_Y. Spen._ I doubt it not, my lord; right will prevail.
_E. Spen._ 'Tis not amiss, my liege, for either part
   To breathe a while; our men, with sweat and dust
   All chok'd well near, begin to faint for heat;
   And this retire refresheth horse and man.
_Y. Spen._ Here come the rebels.

   _Enter the younger_ MORTIMER, LANCASTER, WARWICK,
                 PEMBROKE, _and others._

_Y. Mor._ Look, Lancaster, yonder is Edward
   Among his flatterers.
_Lan._And there let him be,
   Till he pay dearly for their company.
_War._ And shall, or Warwick's sword shall smite in vain.
_K. Edw._ What, rebels, do you shrink and sound retreat?
_Y. Mor._ No, Edward, no; thy flatterers faint and fly.
_Lan._ They'd best betimes forsake thee and their trains,
   For they'll betray thee, traitors as they are.
_Y. Spen._ Traitor on thy face, rebellious Lancaster!
_Pem._ Away, base upstart! brav'st thou nobles thus?
_E. Spen._ A noble attempt and honourable deed,
   Is it not, trow ye, to assemble aid
   And levy arms against your lawful king?
_K. Edw._ For which, ere long, their heads shall satisfy
   T' appease the wrath of their offended king.
_Y. Mor._ Then, Edward, thou wilt fight it to the last,
   And rather bathe thy sword in subjects' blood
   Than banish that pernicious company?
_K. Edw._ Ay, traitors all, rather than thus be brav'd,
   Make England's civil towns huge heaps of stones,
   And ploughs to go about our palace-gates.
_War._ A desperate and unnatural resolution!--
   Alarum to the fight!
   Saint George for England, and the barons' right!
_K. Edw._ Saint George for England, and King Edward's right!
                           [_Alarums.  Exeunt the two parties severally._

   _Enter_ KING EDWARD _and his followers, with the_ Barons
                     _and_ KENT _captive._

_K. Edw._ Now, lusty lords, now not by chance of war,
   But justice of the quarrel and the cause,
   Vail'd is your pride: methinks you hang the heads
   But we'll advance them, traitors: now 'tis time
   To be aveng'd on you for all your braves,
   And for the murder of my dearest friend,
   To whom right well you knew our soul was knit,
   Good Pierce of Gaveston, my sweet favourite:
   Ah, rebels, recreants, you made him away!
_Kent._ Brother, in regard of thee and of thy land,
   Did they remove that flatterer from thy throne.
_K. Edw._ So, sir, you have spoke: away, avoid our presence!
                                                            [_Exit Kent._
   Accursed wretches, was't in regard of us,
   When we had sent our messenger to request
   He might be spar'd to come to speak with us,
   And Pembroke undertook for his return,
   That thou, proud Warwick, watch'd the prisoner,
   Poor Pierce, and headed him 'gainst law of arms?
   For which thy head shall overlook the rest
   As much as thou in rage outwent'st the rest.
_War._ Tyrant, I scorn thy threats and menaces;
   It is but temporal that thou canst inflict.
_Lan._ The worst is death; and better die to live
   Than live in infamy under such a king.
_K. Edw._ Away with them, my lord of Winchester!
   These lusty leaders, Warwick and Lancaster,
   I charge you roundly, off with both their heads!
   Away!
_War._ Farewell, vain world!
_Lan._ Sweet Mortimer, farewell!
_Y. Mor._ England, unkind to thy nobility,
   Groan for this grief! behold how thou art maim'd!
_K. Edw._ Go, take that haughty Mortimer to the Tower;
   There see him safe bestow'd; and, for the rest,
   Do speedy execution on them all.
   Be gone!
_Y. Mor._ What, Mortimer, can ragged stony walls
   Immure thy virtue that aspires to heaven?
   No, Edward, England's scourge, it may not be;
   Mortimer's hope surmounts his fortune far.
                                       [_The captive Barons are led off._
_K. Edw._ Sound, drums and trumpets!  March with me, my friends.
   Edward this day hath crown'd him king anew.
                                 [_Exeunt all except the younger Spenser,
                                     Levune and Baldock._
_Y. Spen._ Levune, the trust that we repose in thee
   Begets the quiet of King Edward's land:
   Therefore be gone in haste, and with advice
   Bestow that treasure on the lords of France,
   That, therewith all enchanted, like the guard
   That suffer'd Jove to pass in showers of gold
   To Danaë, all aid may be denied
   To Isabel the queen, that now in France
   Makes friends, to cross the seas with her young son,
   And step into his father's regiment.
_Levune._ That's it these barons and the subtle queen
   Long levell'd at.
_Bal._ Yea, but, Levune, thou seest,
   These barons lay their heads on blocks together:
   What they intend, the hangman frustrates clean.
_Levune._ Have you no doubt, my lords, I'll clap so close
   Among the lords of France with England's gold,
   That Isabel shall make her plaints in vain,
   And France shall be obdurate with her tears.
_Y. Spen._ Then make for France amain; Levune, away!
   Proclaim King Edward's wars and victories.                  [_Exeunt._

                        _Enter_ KENT.

_Kent._ Fair blows the wind for France: blow, gentle gale,
   Till Edmund be arriv'd for England's good!
   Nature, yield to my country's cause in this!
   A brother? no, a butcher of thy friends!
   Proud Edward, dost thou banish me thy presence?
   But I'll to France, and cheer the wronged queen,
   And certify what Edward's looseness is.
   Unnatural king, to slaughter nobleman
   And cherish flatterers!  Mortimer, I stay
   Thy sweet escape.  Stand gracious, gloomy night,
   To his device!

          _Enter the younger_ MORTIMER _disguised._

_Y. Mor._ Holla! who walketh there?
   Is't you, my lord?
_Kent._ Mortimer, 'tis I.
   But hath thy portion wrought so happily?
_Y. Mor._ It hath, my lord: the warders all asleep,
   I thank them, gave me leave to pass in peace.
   But hath your grace got shipping unto France?
_Kent._ Fear it not.                                           [_Exeunt._

      _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA _and_ PRINCE EDWARD.

_Q. Isab._ Ah, boy, our friends do fail us all in France!
   The lords are cruel, and the king unkind.
   What shall we do?
_P. Edw._ Madam, return to England,
   And please my father well; and then a fig
   For all my uncle's friendship here in France!
   I warrant you, I'll win his highness quickly;
   'A loves me better than a thousand Spensers.
_Q. Isab._ Ah, boy, thou art deceiv'd, at least in this,
   To think that we can yet be tun'd together!
   No, no, we jar too far.--Unkind Valois!
   Unhappy Isabel, when France rejects,
   Whither, O, whither dost thou bend thy steps?

               _Enter_ SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT.

_Sir J._ Madam, what cheer?
_Q. Isab._ Ah, good Sir John of Hainault,
   Never so cheerless nor so far distrest!
_Sir J._ I hear, sweet lady, of the king's unkindness:
   But droop not, madam; noble minds contemn
   Despair.  Will your grace with me to Hainault,
   And there stay time's advantage with your son?--
   How say you, my lord! will you go with your friends,
   And shake off all our fortunes equally?
_P. Edw._ So pleaseth the queen my mother, me it likes:
   The king of England, not the court of France,
   Shall have me from my gracious mother's side,
   Till I be strong enough to break a staff;
   And then have at the proudest Spenser's head!
_Sir J._ Well said, my lord!
_Q. Isab._ O my sweet heart, how do I moan thy wrongs,
   Yet triumph in the hope of thee, my joy!--
   Ah, sweet Sir John, even to the utmost verge
   Of Europe, on the shore of Tanais,
   Will we with thee to Hainault--so we will:
   The marquis is a noble gentleman;
   His grace, I dare presume, will welcome me.--
   But who are these?

         _Enter_ KENT _and the younger_ MORTIMER.

_Kent._ Madam, long may you live,
   Much happier than your friends in England do!
_Q. Isab._ Lord Edmund and Lord Mortimer alive!
   Welcome to France! the news was here, my lord,
   That you were dead, or very near your death.
_Y. Mor._ Lady, the last was truest of the twain:
   But Mortimer, reserv'd for better hap,
   Hath shaken off the thraldom of the Tower,
   And lives t' advance your standard, good my lord.
_P. Edw._ How mean you, and the king my father lives?
   No, my Lord Mortimer, not I, I trow.
_Q. Isab._ Not, son! Why not?  I would it were no worse!--
   But, gentle lords, friendless we are in France.
_Y. Mor._ Monsieur Le Grand, a noble friend of yours,
   Told us, at our arrival, all the news,--
   How hard the nobles, how unkind the king
   Hath show'd himself: but, madam, right makes room
   Where weapons want; and, though a many friends
   Are made away, as Warwick, Lancaster,
   And others of our part and faction,
   Yet have we friends, assure your grace, in England,
   Would cast up caps, and clap their hands for joy,
   To see us there, appointed for our foes.
_Kent._ Would all were well, and Edward well reclaim'd,
   For England's honour, peace, and quietness!
_Y. Mor._ But by the sword, my lord, 't must be deserv'd:
   The king will ne'er forsake his flatterers.
_Sir J._ My lords of England, sith th' ungentle king
   Of France refuseth to give aid of arms
   To this distressed queen, his sister, here,
   Go you with her to Hainault: doubt ye not
   We will find comfort, money, men, and friends,
   Ere long to bid the English king a base.--
   How say'st, young prince, what think you of the match?
_P. Edw._ I think King Edward will outrun us all.
_Q. Isab._ Nay, son, not so; and you must not discourage
   Your friends that are so forward in your aid.
_Kent._ Sir John of Hainault, pardon us, I pray:
   These comforts that you give our woful queen
   Bind us in kindness all at your command.
_Q. Isab._ Yea, gentle brother:--and the God of heaven
   Prosper your happy motion, good Sir John!
_Y. Mor._ This noble gentleman, forward in arms,
   Was born, I see, to be our anchor-hold.--
   Sir John of Hainault, be it thy renown,
   That England's queen and nobles in distress
   Have been by thee restor'd and comforted.
_Sir J._ Madam, along; and you, my lord[s], with me,
   That England's peers may Hainault's welcome see.            [_Exeunt._

   _Enter_ KING EDWARD, ARUNDEL, _the elder_ SPENSER, _the
               younger_ SPENSER, _and others._

_K. Edw._ Thus, after many threats of wrathful war,
   Triumpheth England's Edward with his friends,
   And triumph Edward with his friends uncontroll'd!--
   My Lord of Glocester, do you hear the news?
_Y. Spen._ What news, my lord?
_K. Edw._ Why, man, they say there is great execution
   Done through the realm.--My Lord of Arundel,
   You have the note, have you not?
_Arun._From the Lieutenant of the Tower, my lord.
_K. Edw._ I pray, let us see it.          [_Takes the note from Arundel._
   --What have we there?--
   Read it, Spenser.
                             [_Gives the note to young Spenser, who reads
                                 their names._
   Why, so: they bark'd apace a month ago;
   Now, on my life, they'll neither bark nor bite.
   Now, sirs, the news from France?  Glocester, I trow,
   The lords of France love England's gold so well
   As Isabella gets no aid from thence.
   What now remains? have you proclaim'd, my lord,
   Reward for them can bring in Mortimer?
_Y. Spen._ My lord, we have; and, if he be in England,
   'A will be had ere long, I doubt it not.
_K. Edw._ If, dost thou say?  Spenser, as true as death,
   He is in England's ground: our port-masters
   Are not so careless of their king's command.

                  _Enter a_ Messenger.

   How now! what news with thee? from whence come these?
_Mess._ Letters, my lord, and tidings forth of France:
   To you, my Lord of Glocester, from Levune.
                                       [_Gives letters to young Spenser._
_K. Edw._ Read.
_Y. Spen._ [reading.] _My duty to your honour promised, etc., I
   have, according to instructions in that behalf, dealt with the
   King of France and his lords, and effected that the queen, all
   discontented and discomforted, is gone: whither, if you ask,
   with Sir John of Hainault, brother to the marquis, into
   Flanders.  With them are gone Lord Edmund and the Lord
   Mortimer, having in their company divers of your nation,
   and others; and, as constant report goeth, they intend to
   give King Edward battle in England, sooner than he can
   look for them.  This is all the news of import.
                           Your honour's in all service, Levune._
_K. Edw._ Ah, villains, hath that Mortimer escap'd?
   With him is Edmund gone associate?
   And will Sir John of Hainault lead the round?
   Welcome, o' God's name, madam, and your son!
   England shall welcome you and all your rout.
   Gallop apace, bright Phbus, through the sky;
   And, dusky Night, in rusty iron car,
   Between you both shorten the time, I pray,
   That I may see that most desired day,
   When we may meet these traitors in the field!
   Ah, nothing grieves me, but my little boy
   Is thus misled to countenance their ills!
   Come, friends, to Bristow, there to make us strong:
   And, winds, as equal be to bring them in,
   As you injurious were to bear them forth!                   [_Exeunt._

   _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA, PRINCE EDWARD, KENT, _the
     younger_ MORTIMER, _and_ SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT.

_Q. Isab._ Now, lords, our loving friends and countrymen,
   Welcome to England all, with prosperous winds!
   Our kindest friends in Belgia have we left,
   To cope with friends at home; a heavy case
   When force to force is knit, and sword and glaive
   In civil broils make kin and countrymen
   Slaughter themselves in others, and their sides
   With their own weapons gor'd!  But what's the help?
   Misgovern'd kings are cause of all this wreck;
   And, Edward, thou art one among them all,
   Whose looseness hath betray'd thy land to spoil,
   Who made the channel overflow with blood
   Of thine own people: patron shouldst thou be;
   But thou--
_Y. Mor._ Nay, madam, if you be a warrior,
   You must not grow so passionate in speeches.--
   Lords, sith that we are, by sufferance of heaven,
   Arriv'd and armed in this prince's right,
   Here for our country's cause swear we to him
   All homage, fealty, and forwardness;
   And for the open wrongs and injuries
   Edward hath done to us, his queen, and land,
   We come in arms to wreck it with the sword;
   That England's queen in peace may repossess
   Her dignities and honours; and withal
   We may remove these flatterers from the king
   That havock England's wealth and treasury.
_Sir J._ Sound trumpets, my lord, and forward let us march.
   Edward will think we come to flatter him.
_Kent._ I would he never had been flatter'd more!              [_Exeunt._

_Enter_ KING EDWARD, BALDOCK, _and the younger_ SPENSER.

_Y. Spen._ Fly, fly, my lord! the queen is overstrong;
   Her friends do multiply, and yours do fail.
   Shape we our course to Ireland, there to breathe.
_K. Edw._ What, was I born to fly and run away,
   And leave the Mortimers conquerors behind?
   Give me my horse, and let's reinforce our troops.
   And in this bed of honour die with fame.
_Bald._ O, no, my lord! this princely resolution
   Fits not the time: away! we are pursu'd.                    [_Exeunt._

          _Enter_ KENT, _with a sword and target._

_Kent._ This way he fled; but I am come too late.
   Edward, alas, my heart relents for thee!
   Proud traitor, Mortimer, why dost thou chase
   Thy lawful king, thy sovereign, with thy sword?
   Vile wretch, and why hast thou, of all unkind,
   Borne arms against thy brother and thy king?
   Rain showers of vengeance on my cursed head,
   Thou God, to whom in justice it belongs
   To punish this unnatural revolt!
   Edward, this Mortimer aims at thy life:
   O, fly him, then!  But, Edmund, calm this rage;
   Dissemble, or thou diest; for Mortimer
   And Isabel do kiss, while they conspire:
   And yet she bears a face of love, forsooth:
   Fie on that love that hatcheth death and hate!
   Edmund, away! Bristow to Longshanks' blood
   Is false; be not found single for suspect:
   Proud Mortimer pries near into thy walks.

  _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA, PRINCE EDWARD, _the younger_
       MORTIMER, _and_ SIR JOHN JOHN OF HAINAULT.

_Q. Isab._ Successful battle gives the God of kings
   To them that fight in right, and fear in wrath,
   Since, then, successfully we have prevail'd,
   Thanked be heaven's great architect, and you!
   Ere farther we proceed, my noble lords,
   We here create our well-beloved son,
   Of love and care unto his royal person,
   Lord Warden of the realm; and, sith the Fates
   Have made his father so infortunate,
   Deal you, my lords, in this, my loving lords,
   As to your wisdoms fittest seems in all.
_Kent._ Madam, without offence if I may ask
   How will you deal with Edward in his fall?
_P. Edw._ Tell me, good uncle, what Edward do you mean?
_Kent._ Nephew, your father; I dare not call him king.
_Y. Mor._ My Lord of Kent, what needs these questions?
   'Tis not in her controlment nor in ours;
   But as the realm and parliament shall please,
   So shall your brother be disposed of.--
   I like not this relenting mood in Edmund:
   Madam, 'tis good to look to him betimes.        [_Aside to the Queen._
_Q. Isab._ My lord, the Mayor of Bristow knows our mind.
_Y. Mor._ Yea, madam; and they scape not easily
   That fled the field.
_Q. Isab._ Baldock is with the king:
   A goodly chancellor, is he not, my lord?
_Sir J._ So are the Spensers, the father and the son.
_Y. Mor._ This Edward is the ruin of the realm.

  _Enter_ RICE AP HOWEL _with the elder_ SPENSER _prisoner,
                      and_ Attendants.

_Rice._ God save Queen Isabel and her princely son!
   Madam, the Mayor and citizens of Bristow,
   In sign of love and duty to this presence,
   Present by me this traitor to the state,
   Spenser, the father to that wanton Spenser,
   That, like the lawless Catiline of Rome,
   Revell'd in England's wealth and treasury.
_Isab._ We thank you all.
_Y. Mor._ Your loving care in this
   Deserveth princely favours and rewards.
   But where's the king and the other Spenser fled?
_Rice._ Spenser the son, created Earl of Glocester,
   Is with that smooth-tongu'd scholar Baldock gone,
   And shipp'd but late for Ireland with the king.
_Y. Mor._ Some whirlwind fetch them back, or sink them all!--   [_Aside._
   They shall be started thence, I doubt it not.
_P. Edw._ Shall I not see the king my father yet?
_Kent._ Unhappy Edward, chas'd from England's bounds!           [_Aside._
_Sir J._ Madam, what resteth? why stand you in a muse?
_Q. Isab._ I rue my lord's ill-fortune: but, alas,
   Care of my country call'd me to this war!
_Y. Mor._ Madam, have done with care and sad complaint:
   Your king hath wrong'd your country and himself,
   And we must seek to right it as we may.--
   Meanwhile have hence this rebel to the block.
_E. Spen._ Rebel is he that fights against the prince:
   So fought not they that fought in Edward's right.
_Y. Mor._ Take him away; he prates.
                             [_Exeunt Attendants with the elder Spenser._
                                     You, Rice ap Howel,
   Shall do good service to her majesty,
   Being of countenance in your country here,
   To follow these rebellious runagates.--
   We in mean while, madam, must take advice.
   How Baldock, Spenser, and their complices,
   May in their fall be follow'd to their end.                 [_Exeunt._

   _Enter the_ Abbot, Monks, KING EDWARD, _the younger_
   SPENSER, _and_ BALDOCK (_the three latter disguised_).

_Abbot._ Have you no doubt, my lord; have you no fear:
   As silent and as careful we will be
   To keep your royal person safe with us,
   Free from suspect, and fell invasion
   Of such as have your majesty in chase,
   Yourself, and those your chosen company,
   As danger of this stormy time requires.
_K. Edw._ Father, thy face should harbour no deceit.
   O, hadst thou ever been a king, thy heart,
   Pierc'd deeply with sense of my distress,
   Could not but take compassion of my state!
   Stately and proud in riches and in train,
   Whilom I was, powerful and full of pomp:
   But what is he whom rule and empery
   Have not in life or death made miserable?--
   Come, Spenser,--come, Baldock,--come, sit down by me;
   Make trial now of that philosophy
   That in our famous nurseries of arts
   Thou suck'dst from Plato and from Aristotle.--
   Father, this life contemplative is heaven:
   O, that I might this life in quiet lead!
   But we, alas, are chas'd!--and you, my friends,
   Your lives and my dishonour they pursue.--
   Yet, gentle monks, for treasure, gold, nor fee,
   Do you betray us and our company.
_First Monk._ Your grace may sit secure, if none but we
   Do wot of your abode.
_Y. Spen._ Not one alive: but shrewdly I suspect
   A gloomy fellow in a mead below;
   'A gave a long look after us, my lord;
   And all the land, I know, is up in arms,
   Arms that pursue our lives with deadly hate.
_Bald._ We were embark'd for Ireland; wretched we,
   With awkward winds and with sore tempests driven,
   To fall on shore, and here to pine in fear
   Of Mortimer and his confederates!
_K. Edw._ Mortimer! who talks of Mortimer?
   Who wounds me with the name of Mortimer,
   That bloody man?--Good father, on thy lap
   Lay I this head, laden with mickle care.
   O, might I never ope these eyes again,
   Never again lift up this drooping head,
   O, never more lift up this dying heart!
_Y. Spen._ Look up, my lord.--Baldock, this drowsiness
   Betides no good; here even we are betray'd.

   _Enter, with Welsh hooks,_ RICE AP HOWEL, _a_ Mower,
                    _and_ LEICESTER.

_Mow._ Upon my life, these be the men ye seek.
_Rice._ Fellow, enough.--My lord, I pray, be short;
   A fair commission warrants what we do.
_Leices._ The queen's commission, urg'd by Mortimer:
   What cannot gallant Mortimer with the queen?--
   Alas, see where he sits, and hopes unseen
   T'escape their hands that seek to reave his life!
   Too true it is, _Quem dies vidit veniens superbum,
   Hunc dies vidit fugiens jacentem._
   But, Leicester, leave to grow so passionate.--
   Spenser and Baldock, by no other names,
   I arrest you of high treason here.
   Stand not on titles, but obey th' arrest:
   'Tis in the name of Isabel the queen.--
   My lord, why droop you thus?
_K. Edw._ O day, the last of all my bliss on earth!
   Centre of all misfortune!  O my stars,
   Why do you lour unkindly on a king?
   Comes Leicester, then, in Isabella's name,
   To take my life, my company from me?
   Here, man, rip up this panting breast of mine,
   And take my heart in rescue of my friends.
_Rice._ Away with them!
_Y. Spen._ It may become thee yet
   To let us take our farewell of his grace.
_Abbott._ My heart with pity earns to see this sight;
   A king to bear these words and proud commands!               [_Aside._
_K. Edw._ Spenser, ah, sweet Spenser, thus, then, must we part?
_Y. Spen._ We must, my lord; so will the angry heavens.
_K. Edw._ Nay, so will hell and cruel Mortimer:
   The gentle heavens have not to do in this.
_Bald._ My lord, it is in vain to grieve or storm.
   Here humbly of your grace we take our leaves:
   Our lots are cast; I fear me, so is thine.
_K. Edw._ In heaven we may, in earth ne'er shall we meet:--
   And, Leicester, say, what shall become of us?
_Leices._ Your majesty must go to Killingworth.
_K. Edw._ Must! it is somewhat hard when kings must go.
_Leices._ Here is a litter ready for your grace,
   That waits your pleasure, and the day grows old.
_Rice._ As good be gone, as stay and be benighted.
_K. Edw._ A litter hast thou? lay me in a hearse,
   And to the gates of hell convey me hence;
   Let Pluto's bells ring out my fatal knell,
   And hags howl for my death at Charon's shore;
   For friends hath Edward none but these,
   And these must die under a tyrant's sword.
_Rice._ My lord, be going: care not for these;
   For we shall see them shorter by the heads.
_K. Edw._ Well, that shall be shall be: part we must;
   Sweet Spenser, gentle Baldock, part we must.--
   Hence, feigned weeds! unfeigned are my woes.--
                                            [_Throwing off his disguise._
   Father, farewell.--Leicester, thou stay'st for me;
   And go I must.--Life, farewell, with my friends!
                                     [_Exeunt King Edward and Leicester._
_Y. Spen._ O, is he gone?  is noble Edward gone?
   Parted from hence, never to see us more!
   Rend, sphere of heaven! and, fire, forsake thy orb!
   Earth, melt to air! gone is my sovereign,
   Gone, gone, alas, never to make return!
_Bald._ Spenser, I see our souls are fleeting hence;
   We are depriv'd the sunshine of our life.
   Make for a new life, man; throw up thy eyes
   And heart and hand to heaven's immortal throne;
   Pay nature's debt with cheerful countenance;
   Reduce we all our lessons unto this,--
   To die, sweet Spenser, therefore live we all;
   Spenser, all live to die, and rise to fall.
_Rice._ Come, come, keep these preachments till you come to
   the place appointed.  You, and such as you are, have
   made wise work in England.  Will your lordships away?
_Mow._ Your lordship I trust will remember me?
_Rice._ Remember thee, fellow! what else?  Follow me to
   the town.                                                   [_Exeunt._

    _Enter_ KING EDWARD, LEICESTER, _the_ BISHOP OF
               WINCHESTER, _and_ TRUSSEL.

_Leices._ Be patient, good my lord, cease to lament;
   Imagine Killingworth Castle were your court,
   And that you lay for pleasure here a space,
   Not of compulsion or necessity.
_K. Edw._ Leicester, if gentle words might comfort me,
   Thy speeches long ago had eas'd my sorrows,
   For kind and loving hast thou always been.
   The griefs of private men are soon allay'd;
   But not of kings.  The forest deer, being struck,
   Runs to an herb that closeth up the wounds:
   But when the imperial lion's flesh is gor'd,
   He rends and tears it with his wrathful paw,
   [And], highly scorning that the lowly earth
   Should drink his blood, mounts up to the air:
   And so it fares with me, whose dauntless mind
   Th' ambitious Mortimer would seek to curb,
   And that unnatural queen, false Isabel,
   That thus hath pent and mew'd me in a prison
   For such outrageous passions cloy my soul,
   As with the wings of rancour and disdain
   Full oft[ten] am I soaring up to heaven,
   To plain me to the gods against them both.
   But when I call to mind I am a king,
   Methinks I should revenge me of my wrongs,
   That Mortimer and Isabel have done.
   But what are kings, when regiment is gone,
   But perfect shadows in a sunshine day?
   My nobles rule; I bear the name of king,
   I wear the crown; but am controll'd by them,
   By Mortimer, and my unconstant queen,
   Who spots my nuptial bed with infamy;
   Whilst I am lodg'd within this cave of care,
   Where sorrow at my elbow still attends,
   To company my heart with sad laments,
   That bleeds within me for this strange exchange.
   But tell me, must I now resign my crown,
   To make usurping Mortimer a king?
_Bish. of Win._ Your grace mistakes; it is for England's good,
   And princely Edward's right, we crave the crown.
_K. Edw._ No, 'tis for Mortimer, not Edward's head
   For he's a lamb, emcompassed by wolves,
   Which in a moment will abridge his life.
   But, if proud Mortimer do wear this crown,
   Heavens turn it to a blaze of quenchless fire!
   Or, like the snaky wreath of Tisiphon,
   Engirt the temples of his hateful head!
   So shall not England's vine be perished,
   But Edward's name survive, though Edward dies.
_Leices._ My lord, why waste you thus the time away?
   They stay your answer: will you yield your crown?
_K. Edw._ Ah, Leicester, weigh how hardly I can brook
   To lose my crown and kingdom without cause;
   To give ambitious Mortimer my right,
   That, like a mountain, overwhelms my bliss;
   In which extreme my mind here murder'd is!
   But that the heavens appoint I must obey.--
   Here, take my crown; the life of Edward too:  [_Taking off the crown._
   Two kings in England cannot reign at once.
   But stay a while: let me be king till night,
   That I may gaze upon this glittering crown;
   So shall my eyes receive their last content,
   My head, the latest honour due to it,
   And jointly both yield up their wished right.
   Continue ever, thou celestial sun;
   Let never silent night possess this clime;
   Stand still, you watches of the element;
   All times and seasons, rest you at a stay,
   That Edward may be still fair England's king!
   But day's bright beams doth vanish fast away,
   And needs I must resign my wished crown.
   Inhuman creatures, nurs'd with tiger's milk,
   Why gape you for your sovereign's overthrow?
   My diadem, I mean, and guiltless life.
   See, monsters, see! I'll wear my crown again.
                                                 [_Putting on the crown._
   What, fear you not the fury of your king?--
   But, hapless Edward, thou art fondly led;
   They pass not for thy frowns as late they did,
   But seek to make a new-elected king;
   Which fills my mind with strange despairing thoughts,
   Which thoughts are martyred with endless torments;
   And in this torment comfort find I none,
   But that I feel the crown upon my head;
   And therefore let me wear it yet a while.
_Trus._ My, lord, the parliament must have present news;
   And therefore say, will you resign or no?
                                                      [_The king rageth._
_K. Edw._ I'll not resign, but, whilst I live, [be king].
   Traitors, be gone, and join you with Mortimer.
   Elect, conspire, install, do what you will:
   Their blood and yours shall seal these treacheries.
_Bish. of Win._ This answer we'll return; and so, farewell.
                                                   [_Going with Trussel._
_Leices._ Call them again, my lord, and speak them fair;
   For, if they go, the prince shall lose his right.
_K. Edw._ Call thou them back; I have no power to speak.
_Leices._ My lord, the king is willing to resign.
_Bish. of Win._ If he be not, let him choose.
_K. Edw._ O, would I might! but heavens and earth conspire
   To make me miserable.  Here, receive my crown.
   Receive it? no, these innocent hands of mine
   Shall not be guilty of so foul a crime;
   He of you all that most desires my blood,
   And will be call'd the murderer of a king,
   Take it.  What, are you mov'd? pity you me?
   Then send for unrelenting Mortimer,
   And Isabel, whose eyes being turn'd to steel
   Will sooner sparkle fire than shed a tear.
   Yet stay; for, rather than I'll look on them,
   Here, here! [_Gives the crown._]--Now, sweet God of heaven,
   Make me despise this transitory pomp,
   And sit fot aye enthronised in heaven!
   Come, death, and with thy fingers close my eyes,
   Or, if I live, let me forget myself!
_Bish. of Win._ My lord,--
_K. Edw._ Call me not lord; away, out of my sight!
   Ah, pardon me! grief makes me lunatic.
   Let not that Mortimer protect my son;
   More safety there is in a tiger's jaws
   Than his embracements.  Bear this to the queen,
   Wet with my tears, and dried again with sighs:
                                                 [_Gives a handkerchief._
   If with the sight thereof she be not mov'd,
   Return it back, and dip it in my blood.
   Commend me to my son, and bid him rule
   Better than I: yet how have I transgress'd,
   Unless it be with too much clemency?
_Trus._ And thus, most humbly do we take our leave.
_K. Edw._ Farewell.
                   [_Exeunt the Bishop of Winchester and Trussel with the
                      crown._
                     I know the next news that they bring
   Will be my death; and welcome shall it be:
   To wretched men death is felicity.
_Leices._ Another post! what news brings he?

   _Enter_ BERKELEY, _who gives a paper to_ LEICESTER.

_K. Edw._ Such news as I expect.--Come, Berkeley, come,
   And tell thy message to my naked breast.
_Berk._ My lord, think not a thought so villanous
   Can harbour in a man of noble birth.
   To do your highness service and devoir,
   And save you from your foes, Berkeley would die.
_Leices._ My lord, the council of the queen command
   That I resign my charge.
_K. Edw._ And who must keep me now?  Must you, my lord?
_Berk._ Ay, my most gracious lord; so 'tis decreed.
_K. Edw._ [_Taking the paper._]  By Mortimer, whose name is written here!
   Well may I rent his name that rends my heart.             [_Tears it._
   This poor revenge hath something eas'd my mind:
   So may his limbs be torn as is this paper!
   Hear me, immortal Jove, and grant it too!
_Berk._ Your grace must hence with me to Berkeley straight.
_K. Edw._ Whither you will: all places are alike,
   And every earth is fit for burial.
_Leices._ Favour him, my lord, as much as lieth in you.
_Berk._ Even so betide my soul as I use him!
_K. Edw._ Mine enemy hath pitied my estate,
   And that's the cause that I am now remov'd.
_Berk._ And thinks your grace that Berkeley will be cruel?
_K. Edw._ I know not; but of this am I assur'd,
   That death ends all, and I can die but once.--
   Leicester, farewell.
_Leices._ Not yet, my lord; I'll bear you on your way.         [_Exeunt._

   _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA _and the younger_ MORTIMER.

_Y. Mor._ Fair Isabel, now have we our desire;
   The proud corrupters of the light-brain'd king
   Have done their homage to the lofty gallows,
   And he himself lies in captivity.
   Be rul'd by me, and we will rule the realm:
   In any case take heed of childish fear,
   For now we hold an old wolf by the ears,
   That, if he slip, will seize upon us both,
   And gripe the sorer, being grip'd himself.
   Think therefore, madam, that imports us much
   To erect your son with all the speed we may,
   And that I be protector over him:
   For our behoof, 'twill bear the greater sway
   Whenas a king's name shall be under-writ.
_Q. Isab._ Sweet Mortimer, the life of Isabel,
   Be thou persuaded that I love thee well;
   And therefore, so the prince my son be safe,
   Whom I esteem as dear as these mine eyes,
   Conclude against his father what thou wilt,
   And I myself will willingly subscribe.
_Y. Mor._ First would I hear news he were depos'd,
   And then let me alone to handle him.

                   _Enter_ Messenger.

   Letters! from whence?
_Mess._ From Killingworth, my lord?
_Q. Isab._ How fares my lord the king?
_Mess._ In health, madam, but full of pensiveness.
_Q. Isab._ Alas, poor soul, would I could ease his grief!

     _Enter the_ BISHOP OF WINCHESTER _with the crown._

   Thanks, gentle Winchester.--
                               Sirrah, be gone.        [_Exit Messenger._
_Bish. of Win._ The king hath willingly resign'd his crown.
_Q. Isab._ O, happy news! send for the prince my son.
_Bish. of Win._ Further, or this letter was seal'd, Lord Berkeley came,
   So that he now is gone from Killingworth;
   And we have heard that Edmund laid a plot
   To set his brother free; nor more but so.
   The Lord of Berkeley is so pitiful
   As Leicester that had charge of him before.
_Q. Isab._ Then let some other be his guardian.
_Y. Mor._ Let me alone; here is the privy-seal,--
                                                [_Exit the Bish. of Win._
   Who's there?  Call hither, Gurney and Matrevis.--
                                                 [_To Attendants within._
   To dash the heavy-headed Edmund's drift,
   Berkeley shall be discharg'd, the king remov'd,
   And none but we shall know where he lieth.
_Q. Isab._ But, Mortimer, as long as he survives,
   What safety rests for us or for my son?
_Y. Mor._ Speak, shall he presently be despatch'd and die?
_Q. Isab._ I would he were, so 'twere not by my means!

               _Enter_ MATREVIS _and_ GURNEY.

_Y. Mor._ Enough.--Matrevis, write a letter presently
   Unto the Lord of Berkeley from ourself,
   That he resign the king to thee and Gurney;
   And, when 'tis done, we will subscribe our name.
_Mat._ It shall be done, my lord.                              [_Writes._
_Y. Mor._ Gurney,--
_Gur._ My lord?
_Y. Mor._ As thou intend'st to rise by Mortimer,
   Who now makes Fortune's wheel turn as he please,
   Seek all the means thou canst to make him droop,
   And neither give him kind word nor good look.
_Gur._ I warrant you, my lord.
_Y. Mor._ And this above the rest: because we hear
   That Edmund casts to work his liberty,
   Remove him still from place to place by night,
   Till at the last he come to Killingworth,
   And then from thence to Berkeley back again;
   And by the way, to make him fret the more,
   Speak curstly to him; and in any case
   Let no man comfort him, if he chance to weep,
   But amplify his grief with bitter words.
_Mat._ Fear not, my lord; we'll do as you command.
_Y. Mor._ So, now away! post thitherwards amain.
_Q. Isab._ Whither goes this letter? to my lord the king?
   Commend me humbly to his majesty,
   And tell him that I labour all in vain
   To ease his grief and work his liberty;
   And bear him this as witness of my love.                [_Gives ring._
_Mat._ I will, madam.                                [_Exit with Gurney._
_Y. Mor._ Finely dissembled! do so still, sweet queen.
   Here comes the young prince with the Earl of Kent.
_Q. Isab._ Something he whispers in his childish ears.
_Y. Mor._ If he have such access unto the prince,
   Our plots and stratagems will soon be dash'd.
_Q. Isab._ Use Edmund friendly, as if all were well.

   _Enter_ PRINCE EDWARD, _and_ KENT _talking with him._

_Y. Mor._ How fares my honourable Lord of Kent?
_Kent._ In health, sweet Mortimer.--How fares your grace?
_Q. Isab._ Well, if my lord your brother were enlarg'd.
_Kent._ I hear of late he hath depos'd himself.
_Q. Isab._ The more my grief.
_Y. Mor._ And mine.
_Kent._ Ah, they do dissemble!                                  [_Aside._
_Q. Isab._ Sweet son, come hither; I must talk with thee.
_Y. Mor._ You, being his uncle and the next of blood,
   Do look to be protector o'er the prince.
_Kent._ Not I, my lord: who should protect the son,
   But she that gave him life?  I mean the queen.
_P. Edw._ Mother, persuade me not to wear the crown:
   Let him be king; I am too young to reign.
_Q. Isab._ But be content, seeing 'tis his highness' pleasure.
_P. Edw._ Let me but see him first, and then I will.
_Kent._ Ay, do, sweet nephew.
_Q. Isab._ Brother, you know it is impossible.
_P. Edw._ Why, is he dead?
_Q. Isab._ No, God forbid!
_Kent._ I would those words proceeded from your heart!
_Y. Mor._ Inconstant Edmund, dost thou favour him,
   That wast a cause of his imprisonment?
_Kent._ The more cause now have I to make amends.
_Y. Mor._ [_aside to_ Q. ISAB.]
   I tell thee, 'tis not meet that one so false
   Should come about the person of a prince.--
   My lord, he hath betray'd the king his brother,
   And therefore trust him not.
_P. Edw._ But he repents, and sorrows for it now.
_Q. Isab._ Come, son, and go with this gentle lord and me.
_P. Edw._ With you I will, but not with Mortimer.
_Y. Mor._ Why, youngling, 'sdain'st thou so of Mortimer?
   Then I will carry thee by force away.
_P. Edw._ Help, uncle Kent! Mortimer will wrong me.
_Q. Isab._ Brother Edmund, strive not; we are his friends;
   Isabel is nearer than the Earl of Kent.
_Kent._ Sister, Edward is my charge; redeem him.
_Q. Isab._ Edward is my son, and I will keep him.
_Kent._ Mortimer shall know that he hath wronged me.
   Hence will I haste to Killingworth Castle,
   And rescue aged Edward from his foes,
   To be reveng'd on Mortimer and thee.                         [_Aside._
                 [_Exeunt, on the one side, Queen Isabella, Prince Edward
                    and the younger Mortimer; on other other, Kent._

       _Enter_ MATREVIS, GURNEY, _and_ Soldiers, _with_
                         KING EDWARD.

_Mat._ My lord, be not pensive; we are your friends:
   Men are ordain'd to live in misery;
   Therefore, come; dalliance dangereth our lives.
_K. Edw._ Friends, whither must unhappy Edward go?
   Will hateful Mortimer appoint no rest?
   Must I be vexed like the nightly bird,
   Whose sight is loathsome to all winged fowls?
   When will the fury of his mind assuage?
   When will his heart be satisfied with blood?
   If mine will serve, unbowel straight this breast,
   And give my heart to Isabel and him:
   It is the chiefest mark they level at.
_Gur._Not so, my liege: the queen hath given this charge,
   To keep your grace in safety:
   Your passions make your dolours to increase.
_K. Edw._ This usage makes my misery increase.
   But can my air of life continue long,
   When all my senses are annoy'd with stench?
   Within a dungeon England's king is kept,
   Where I am starv'd for want of sustenance;
   My daily diet is heart-breaking sobs,
   That almost rent the closet of my heart:
   Thus lives old Edward not reliev'd by any,
   And so must die, though pitied by many.
   O, water, gentle friends, to cool my thirst,
   And clear my body from foul excrements!
_Mat._ Here's channel-water, as our charge is given:
   Sit down, for we'll be barbers to your grace.
_K. Edw._ Traitors, away! what, will you murder me,
   Of choke your sovereign with puddle-water?
_Gur._ No, but wash your face, and shave away your beard,
   Lest you be known, and so be rescued.
_Mat._ Why strive you thus? your labour is in vain.
_K. Edw._ The wren may strive against the lion's strength,
   But all in vain: so vainly do I strive
   To seek for mercy at a tyrant's hand.
                   [_They wash him with puddle-water, and shave his beard
                     away._
   Immortal powers, that know the painful cares
   That wait upon my poor distressed soul,
   O, level all your looks upon these daring men
   That wrong their liege and sovereign, England's king!
   O Gaveston, it is for thee that I am wrong'd!
   For me both thou and both the Spensers died;
   And for your sakes a thousand wrongs I'll take.
   The Spensers' ghosts, wherever they remain,
   Wish well to mine; then, tush, for them I'll die.
_Mat._ 'Twixt theirs and yours shall be no enmity.
   Come, come, away!  Now put the torches out:
   We'll enter in by darkness to Killingworth.
_Gur._ How now! who comes there?

                         _Enter_ KENT.

_Mat._ Guard the king sure: it is the Earl of Kent.
_K. Edw._ O gentle brother, help to rescue me!
_Mat._ Keep them asunder; thrust in the king.
_Kent._ Soldiers, let me but talk to him one word.
_Gur._ Lay hands upon the earl for his assault.
_Kent._ Lay down your weapons, traitors! yield the king!
_Mat._ Edmund, yield thou thyself, or thou shalt die.
_Kent._ Base villains, wherefore do you gripe me thus?
_Gur._ Bind him, and so convey him to the court.
_Kent._ Where is the court but here? here is the king
   And I will visit him: why stay you me?
_Mat._ The court is where Lord Mortimer remains:
   Thither shall your honour go; and so, farewell.
                          [_Exeunt Matrevis and Gurney with King Edward._
_Kent._ O, miserable is that common-weal,
   Where lords keep courts, and kings are lock'd in prison!
_First Sold._ Wherefore stay we? on, sirs, to the court!
_Kent._ Ay, lead me whither you will, even to my death,
   Seeing that my brother cannot be releas'd.                  [_Exeunt._

             _Enter the younger_ MORTIMER.

_Y. Mor._ The king must die, or Mortimer goes down;
   The commons now begin to pity him:
   Yet he that is the cause of Edward's death,
   Is sure to pay for it when his son's of age;
   And therefore will I do it cunningly.
   This letter, written by a friend of ours,
   Contains his death, yet bids then save his life;
                                                                [_Reads._
   _Edwardum occidere nolite timere, bonum est,
   Fear not to kill the king, 'tis good he die:_
   But read it thus, and that's another sense;
   _Edwardum occidere nolite, timere bonum est,
   Kill not the king, 'tis good to fear the worst._
   Unpointed as it is, thus shall it go.
   That, being dead, if it chance to be found,
   Matrevis and the rest may bear the blame,
   And we be quit that caus'd it to be done.
   Within this room is lock'd the messenger
   That shall convey it, and perform the rest;
   And, by a secret token that he bears,
   Shall he be murder'd when the deed is done.--
   Lightborn, come forth!

                    _Enter_ LIGHTBORN.

                           Art thou so resolute as thou wast?
_Light._ What else, my lord? and far more resolute.
_Y. Mor._ And hast thou cast how to accomplish it?
_Light._ Ay, ay; and none shall know which way he died.
_Y. Mor._ But at his looks, Lightborn, thou wilt relent.
_Light._ Relent! ha, ha! I use much to relent.
_Y. Mor._ Well, do it bravely, and be secret.
_Light._ You shall not need to give instructions;
   'Tis not the first time I have kill'd a man:
   I learn'd in Naples how to poison flowers;
   To strangle with a lawn thrust down the throat;
   To pierce the wind pipe with a needle's point;
   Or, whilst one is asleep, to take a quill,
   And blow a little powder in his ears;
   Or open his mouth, and pour quick-silver down.
   But yet I have a braver way than these.
_Y. Mor._ What's that?
_Light._ Nay, you shall pardon me; none shall know my tricks.
_Y. Mor._ I care not how it is, so it be not spied.
   Deliver this to Gurney and Matrevis:                  [_Gives letter._
   At every ten-mile end thou hast a horse:
   Take this [_Gives money_]: away, and never see me more!
_Light._ No?
_Y. Mor._ No; unless thou bring me news of Edward's death.
_Light._ That will I quickly do.  Farewell, my lord.             [_Exit._
_Y. Mor._ The prince I rule, the queen do I command,
   And with a lowly congé to the ground
   The proudest lords salute me as I pass;
   I seal, I cancel, I do what I will.
   Fear'd am I more than lov'd;--let me be fear'd,
   And, when I frown, make all the court look pale.
   I view the prince with Aristarchus' eyes,
   Whose looks were as a breeching to a boy.
   They thrust upon me the protectorship,
   And sue to me for that that I desire;
   While at the council-table, grave enough,
   And not unlike a bashful puritan,
   First I complain of imbecility,
   Saying it is _onus quam gravissimum;_
   Till, being interrupted by my friends,
   _Suscepi_ that _provinciam_, as they term it;
   And, to conclude, I am Protector now.
   Now all is sure: the queen and Mortimer
   Shall rule the realm, the king; and none rule us.
   Mine enemies will I plague, my friends advance;
   And what I list command who dare control?
   _Major sum quàm cui possit fortuna nocere:_
   And that this be the coronation-day,
   It pleaseth me and Isabel the queen.               [_Trumpets within._
   The trumpets sound; I must go take my place.

  _Enter_ KING EDWARD THE THIRD, QUEEN ISABELLA, _the_
    ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, Champion, _and_ Nobles.

_Archb. of Cant._ Long live King Edward, by the grace of God
   King of England and Lord of Ireland!
_Cham._ If any Christian, Heathen, Turk, or Jew,
   Dares but affirm that Edward's not true king,
   And will avouch his saying with the sword,
   I am the Champion that will combat him.
_Y. Mor._ None comes: sound, trumpets!                       [_Trumpets._
_K. Edw. Third._ Champion, here's to thee.                [_Gives purse._
_Q. Isab._ Lord Mortimer, now take him to your charge.

            _Enter_ Soldiers _with_ KENT _prisoner._

_Y. Mor._ What traitor have we there with blades and bills?
_First Sold._ Edmund the Earl of Kent.
_K. Edw. Third._ What hath he done?
_First Sold._ 'A would have taken the king away perforce,
   As we were bringing him to Killingworth.
_Y. Mor._ Did you attempt his rescue, Edmund? speak.
_Kent._ Mortimer, I did: he is our king,
   And thou compell'st this prince to wear the crown.
_Y. Mor._ Strike off his head: he shall have martial law.
_Kent._ Strike off my head! base traitor, I defy thee!
_K. Edw. Third._ My lord, he is my uncle, and shall live.
_Y. Mor._ My lord, he is your enemy, and shall die.
_Kent._ Stay, villains!
_K. Edw. Third._ Sweet mother, if I cannot pardon him,
   Entreat my Lord Protector for his life.
_Q. Isab._ Son, be content: I dare not speak a word.
_K. Edw. Third._ Nor I; and yet methinks I should command:
   But, seeing I cannot, I'll entreat for him.--
   My lord, if you will let my uncle live,
   I will requite it when I come to age.
_Y. Mor._ 'Tis for your highness' good and for the realm's.--
   How often shall I bid you bear him hence?
_Kent._ Art thou king? must I die at thy command?
_Y. Mor._ At our command.--Once more, away with him!
_Kent._ Let me but stay and speak; I will not go:
   Either my brother or his son is king,
   And none of both them thirst for Edmund's blood:
   And therefore, soldiers, whither will you hale me?
                [_Soldiers hale Kent away, and carry him to be beheaded._
_K. Edw. Third._ What safety may I look for at his hands,
   If that my uncle shall be murder'd thus?
_Q. Isab._ Fear not, sweet boy; I'll guard thee from thy foes:
   Had Edmund liv'd, he would have sought thy death.
   Come, son, we'll ride a-hunting in the park.
_K. Edw. Third._ And shall my uncle Edmund ride with us?
_Q. Isab._ He is a traitor; think not on him: come.            [_Exeunt._

               _Enter_ MATREVIS _and_ GURNEY.

_Mat._ Gurney, I wonder the king dies not,
   Being in a vault up to the knees in water,
   To which the channels of the castle run,
   From whence a damp continually ariseth,
   That were enough to poison any man,
   Much more a king, brought up so tenderly.
_Gur._ And so do I, Matrevis: yesternight
   I open'd but the door to throw him meat,
   And I was almost stifled with the savour.
_Mat._ He hath a body able to endure
   More than we can inflict: and therefore now
   Let us assail his mind another while.
_Gur._ Send for him out thence, and I will anger him.
_Mat._ But stay; who's this?

                 _Enter_ LIGHTBORN.

_Light._ My Lord Protector greets you.                   [_Gives letter._
_Gur._ What's there?  I know not how to construe it.
_Mat._ Gurney, it was left unpointed for the nonce;
   _Edwardum occidere nolite timere,_
   That's his meaning.
_Light._ Know you this token?  I must have the king.      [_Gives token._
_Mat._ Ay, stay a while; thou shalt have answer straight.--
   This villain's sent to make away the king.
_Gur._ I thought as much.
_Mat._ And, when the murder's done,
   See how he must be handled for his labour,--
   _Pereat iste!_  Let him have the king;
   What else?--Here is the keys, this is the lake:
   Do as you are commanded by my lord.
_Light._ I know what I must do.  Get you away:
   Yet be not far off; I shall need your help:
   See that in the next room I have a fire,
   And get me a spit, and let it be red-hot.
_Mat._ Very well.
_Gur._ Need you anything besides?
_Light._ What else? a table and a feather-bed.
_Gur._ That's all?
_Light._ Ay, ay: so, when I call you, bring it in.
_Mat._ Fear not thou that.
_Gur._ Here's a light to go into the dungeon.
                [_Gives light to Lightborn, and then exit with Matrevis._
_Light._ So, now.
   Must I about this gear: ne'er was there any
   So finely handled as this king shall be.--
   Foh, here's a place indeed with all my heart!
_K. Edw._ Who's there? what light is that? wherefore com'st thou?
_Light._ To comfort you, and bring you joyful news.
_K. Edw._ Small comfort finds poor Edward in thy looks:
   Villain, I know thou com'st to murder me.
_Light._ To murder you, my most gracious lord?
   Far is it from my heart to do you harm.
   The queen sent me to see how you were us'd,
   For she relents at this your misery:
   And what eye can refrain from shedding tears,
   To see a king in this most piteous state?
_K. Edw._ Weep'st thou already? list a while to me,
   And then thy heart, were it as Gurney's is,
   Or as Matrevis', hewn from the Caucasus,
   Yet will it melt ere I have done my tale.
   This dungeon where they keep me is the sink
   Wherein the filth of all the castle falls.
_Light._ O villains!
_K. Edw._ And there, in mire and puddle, have I stood
   This ten days' space; and, lest that I should sleep,
   One plays continually upon a drum;
   They give me bread and water, being a king;
   So that, for want of sleep and sustenance,
   My mind's distemper'd, and my body's numb'd,
   And whether I have limbs or no I know not.
   O, would my blood dropp'd out from every vein,
   As doth this water from my tatter'd robes!
   Tell Isabel the queen, I look'd not thus,
   When for her sake I ran at tilt in France,
   And there unhors'd the Duke of Cleremont.
_Light._ O, speak no more, my lord! this breaks my heart.
   Lie on this bed, and rest yourself a while.
_K. Edw._ These looks of thine can harbour naught but death;
   I see my tragedy written in thy brows.
   Yet stay a while; forbear thy bloody hand,
   And let me see the stroke before it comes,
   That even then when I shall lose my life,
   My mind may be more steadfast on my God.
_Light._ What means your highness to mistrust me thus?
_K. Edw._ What mean'st thou to dissemble with me thus?
_Light._ These hands were never stain'd with innocent blood,
   Nor shall they now be tainted with a king's.
_K. Edw._ Forgive my thought for having such a thought.
   One jewel have I left; receive thou this:              [_Gives jewel._
   Still fear I, and I know not what's the cause,
   But every joint shakes as I give it thee.
   O, if thou harbour'st murder in thy heart,
   Let this gift change thy mind, and save thy soul!
   Know that I am a king: O, at that name
   I feel a hell of grief! where is my crown?
   Gone, gone! and do I [still] remain alive?
_Light._ You're overwatch'd, my lord: lie down and rest.
_K. Edw._ But that grief keeps me waking, I should sleep;
   For not these ten days have these eye-lids clos'd.
   Now, as I speak, they fall; and yet with fear
   Open again.  O, wherefore sitt'st thou here?
_Light._ If you mistrust me, I'll be gone, my lord.
_K. Edw._ No, no; for, if thou mean'st to murder me,
   Thou wilt return again; and therefore stay.                 [_Sleeps._
_Light._ He sleeps.
_K. Edw._ [_waking_] O, let me not die yet!  O, stay a while!
_Light._ How now, my lord!
_K. Edw._ Something still buzzeth in mine ears,
   And tells me, if I sleep, I never wake:
   This fear is that which makes me tremble thus;
   And therefore tell me, wherefore art thou come?
_Light._ To rid thee of thy life.--Matrevis, come!

              _Enter_ MATREVIS _and_ GURNEY.

_K. Edw._ I am too weak and feeble to resist.--
   Assist me, sweet God, and receive my soul!
_Light._ Run for the table.
_K. Edw._ O, spare me, or despatch me in a trice!
                   [_Matrevis brings in a table.  King Edward is murdered
                       by holding him down on the bed with the table, and
                       stamping on it._
_Light._ So, lay the table down, and stamp on it,
   But not too hard, lest that you bruise his body.
_Mat._ I fear me that this cry will raise the town,
   And therefore let us take horse and away.
_Light._ Tell me, sirs, was it not bravely done?
_Gur._ Excellent well: take this for thy reward.
                                            [_Stabs Lightborn, who dies._
   Come, let us cast the body in the moat,
   And bear the king's to Mortimer our lord:
   Away!                                       [_Exeunt with the bodies._

         _Enter the younger_ MORTIMER _and_ MATREVIS.

_Y. Mor._ Is't done, Matrevis, and the murderer dead?
_Mat._ Ay, my good lord: I would it were undone!
_Y. Mor._ Matrevis, if thou now grow'st penitent,
   I'll be thy ghostly father; therefore choose,
   Whether thou wilt be secret in this,
   Or else die by the hand of Mortimer.
_Mat._ Gurney, my lord, is fled, and will, I fear,
   Betray us both; therefore let me fly.
_Y. Mor._ Fly to the savages!
_Mat._ I humbly thank your honour.                               [_Exit._
_Y. Mor._ As for myself, I stand as Jove's huge tree,
   And others are but shrubs compar'd to me:
   All tremble at my name, and I fear none:
   Let's see who dare impeach me for his death!

                  _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA.

_Q. Isab._ Ah, Mortimer, the king my son hath news,
   His father's dead, and we have murder'd him!
_Y. Mor._ What if he have? the king is yet a child.
_Q. Isab._ Ay, but he tears his hair, and wrings his hands,
   And vows to be reveng'd upon us both.
   Into the council-chamber he is gone,
   To crave the aid and succour of his peers.
   Ay me, see where he comes, and they with him!
   Now, Mortimer, begins our tragedy.

   _Enter_ KING EDWARD THE THIRD, Lords, _and_ Attendants.

_First Lord._ Fear not, my lord; know that you are a king.
_K. Edw. Third._ Villain!--
_Y. Mor._ Ho, now, my lord!
_K. Edw. Third._ Think not that I am frighted with thy words:
   My father's murder'd through thy treachery;
   And thou shalt die, and on his mournful hearse
   Thy hateful and accursed head shall lie,
   To witness to the world that by thy means
   His kingly body was too soon interr'd.
_Q. Isab._ Weep not, sweet son.
_K. Edw. Third._ Forbid not me to weep; he was my father;
   And had you lov'd him half so well as I,
   You could not bear his death thus patiently:
   But you, I fear, conspir'd with Mortimer.
_First Lord._ Why speak you not unto my lord the king?
_Y. Mor._ Because I think scorn to be accus'd.
   Who is the man dares say I murder'd him?
_K. Edw. Third._ Traitor, in me my loving father speaks,
   And plainly saith, 'twas thou that murder'dst him.
_Y. Mor._ But hath your grace no other proof than this?
_K. Edw. Third._ Yes, if this be the hand of Mortimer.
                                                       [_Showing letter._
_Y. Mor._ False Gurney hath betray'd me and himself.
                                              [_Aside to Queen Isabella._
_Q. Isab._ I fear'd as much: murder can not be hid.
_Y. Mor._ It is my hand; what gather you by this?
_K. Edw. Third._ That thither thou didst send a murderer.
_Y. Mor._ What murderer? bring forth the man I sent.
_K. Edw. Third._ Ah, Mortimer, thou know'st that he is slain!
   And so shalt thou be too.--Why stays he here?
   Bring him unto a hurdle, drag him forth;
   Hang him, I say, and set his quarters up:
   And bring his head back presently to me.
_Q. Isab._ For my sake, sweet son, pity Mortimer!
_Y. Mor._ Madam, entreat not: I will rather die
   Than sue for life unto a paltry boy.
_K. Edw. Third._ Hence with the traitor, with the murderer!
_Y. Mor._ Base Fortune, now I see, that in thy wheel
   There is a point, to which when men aspire,
   They tumble headlong down: that point I touch'd,
   And, seeing there was no place to mount up higher,
   Why should I grieve at my declining fall?--
   Farewell, fair queen: weep not for Mortimer,
   That scorns the world, and, as a traveller,
   Goes to discover countries yet unknown.
_K. Edw. Third._ What, suffer you the traitor to delay?
                           [_Exit the younger Mortimer with First Lord and
                              some of the Attendants._
_Q. Isab._ As thou receivest thy life from me,
   Spill not the blood of gentle Mortimer!
_K. Edw. Third._ This argues that you spilt my father's blood,
   Else would you not entreat for Mortimer.
_Q. Isab._ I spill his blood! no.
_K. Edw. Third._ Ay, madam, you; for so the rumour runs.
_Q. Isab._ That rumour is untrue: for loving thee,
   Is this report rais'd on poor Isabel.
_K. Edw. Third._ I do not think her so unnatural.
_Sec. Lord._ My lord, I fear me it will prove too true.
_K. Edw. Third._ Mother, you are suspected for his death
   And therefore we commit you to the Tower,
   Till further trial may be made thereof.
   If you be guilty, though I be your son,
   Think not to find me slack or pitiful.
_Q. Isab._ Nay, to my death; for too long have I liv'd,
   Whenas my son thinks to abridge my days.
_K. Edw. Third._ Away with her! her words enforce these tears,
   And I shall pity her, if she speak again.
_Q. Isab._ Shall I not mourn for my beloved lord?
   And with the rest accompany him to his grave.
_Sec. Lord._ Thus, madam, 'tis the king's will you shall hence.
_Q. Isab._ He hath forgotten me: stay; I am his mother.
_Sec. Lord._ That boots not; therefore, gentle madam, go.
_Q. Isab._ Then come, sweet death, and rid me of this grief!
                     [_Exit with Second Lord and some of the Attendants._

     _Re-enter_ First Lord, _with the head of the younger_
                           MORTIMER.

_First Lord._ My lord, here is the head of Mortimer.
_K. Edw. Third._ Go fetch my father's hearse, where it shall lie;
   And bring my funeral robes.                      [_Exeunt Attendants._
                                Accursed head,
   Could I have rul'd thee then, as I do now,
   Thou hadst not hatch'd this monstrous treachery!--
   Here comes the hearse: help me to mourn, my lords.

   _Re-enter_ Attendants, _with the hearse and funeral robes._

   Sweet father, here unto thy murder'd ghost
   I offer up the wicked traitor's head;
   And let these tears, distilling from mine eyes,
   Be witness of my grief and innocency.                       [_Exeunt._

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

THE TRAGICAL HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS

FROM THE QUARTO OF 1604.


          Enter CHORUS.

     CHORUS. Not marching now in fields of Thrasymene,
     Where Mars did mate[1] the Carthaginians;
     Nor sporting in the dalliance of love,
     In courts of kings where state is overturn'd;
     Nor in the pomp of proud audacious deeds,
     Intends our Muse to vaunt[2] her[3] heavenly verse:
     Only this, gentlemen,--we must perform
     The form of Faustus' fortunes, good or bad:
     To patient judgments we appeal our plaud,
     And speak for Faustus in his infancy.
     Now is he born, his parents base of stock,
     In Germany, within a town call'd Rhodes:
     Of riper years, to Wertenberg he went,
     Whereas[4] his kinsmen chiefly brought him up.
     So soon he profits in divinity,
     The fruitful plot of scholarism grac'd,
     That shortly he was grac'd with doctor's name,
     Excelling all whose sweet delight disputes
     In heavenly matters of theology;
     Till swoln with cunning,[5] of a self-conceit,
     His waxen wings did mount above his reach,
     And, melting, heavens conspir'd his overthrow;
     For, falling to a devilish exercise,
     And glutted now[6] with learning's golden gifts,
     He surfeits upon cursed necromancy;
     Nothing so sweet as magic is to him,
     Which he prefers before his chiefest bliss:
     And this the man that in his study sits.
          [Exit.]

          FAUSTUS discovered in his study.[7]

     FAUSTUS. Settle thy studies, Faustus, and begin
     To sound the depth of that thou wilt profess:
     Having commenc'd, be a divine in shew,
     Yet level at the end of every art,
     And live and die in Aristotle's works.
     Sweet Analytics, 'tis thou[8] hast ravish'd me!
     Bene disserere est finis logices.
     Is, to dispute well, logic's chiefest end?
     Affords this art no greater miracle?
     Then read no more; thou hast attain'd that[9] end:
     A greater subject fitteth Faustus' wit:
     Bid Economy[10] farewell, and[11] Galen come,
     Seeing, Ubi desinit philosophus, ibi incipit medicus:
     Be a physician, Faustus; heap up gold,
     And be eterniz'd for some wondrous cure:
     Summum bonum medicinae sanitas,
     The end of physic is our body's health.
     Why, Faustus, hast thou not attain'd that end?
     Is not thy common talk found aphorisms?
     Are not thy bills hung up as monuments,
     Whereby whole cities have escap'd the plague,
     And thousand desperate maladies been eas'd?
     Yet art thou still but Faustus, and a man.
     Couldst[12] thou make men[13] to live eternally,
     Or, being dead, raise them to life again,
     Then this profession were to be esteem'd.
     Physic, farewell!  Where is Justinian?

          [Reads.]
     Si una eademque res legatur[14] duobus, alter rem,
     alter valorem rei, &c.

     A pretty case of paltry legacies!

          [Reads.]
     Exhoereditare filium non potest pater, nisi, &c.[15]

     Such is the subject of the institute,
     And universal body of the law:[16]
     This[17] study fits a mercenary drudge,
     Who aims at nothing but external trash;
     Too servile[18] and illiberal for me.
     When all is done, divinity is best:
     Jerome's Bible, Faustus; view it well.

          [Reads.]
     Stipendium peccati mors est.
                                   Ha!
                                        Stipendium, &c.

     The reward of sin is death:  that's hard.

          [Reads.]
     Si peccasse negamus, fallimur, et nulla est in nobis veritas;

     If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
     there's no truth in us.  Why, then, belike we must sin, and so
     consequently die:
     Ay, we must die an everlasting death.
     What doctrine call you this, Che sera, sera,[19]
     What will be, shall be?  Divinity, adieu!
     These metaphysics of magicians,
     And necromantic books are heavenly;
     Lines, circles, scenes,[20] letters, and characters;
     Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires.
     O, what a world of profit and delight,
     Of power, of honour, of omnipotence,
     Is promis'd to the studious artizan!
     All things that move between the quiet poles
     Shall be at my command:  emperors and kings
     Are but obeyed in their several provinces,
     Nor can they raise the wind, or rend the clouds;
     But his dominion that exceeds in this,
     Stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man;
     A sound magician is a mighty god:
     Here, Faustus, tire[21] thy brains to gain a deity.

          Enter WAGNER.[22]

     Wagner, commend me to my dearest friends,
     The German Valdes and Cornelius;
     Request them earnestly to visit me.

     WAGNER. I will, sir.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Their conference will be a greater help to me
     Than all my labours, plod I ne'er so fast.

          Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     GOOD ANGEL. O, Faustus, lay that damned book aside,
     And gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,
     And heap God's heavy wrath upon thy head!
     Read, read the Scriptures:--that is blasphemy.

     EVIL ANGEL. Go forward, Faustus, in that famous art
     Wherein all Nature's treasure[23] is contain'd:
     Be thou on earth as Jove[24] is in the sky,
     Lord and commander of these elements.[25]
          [Exeunt Angels.]

     FAUSTUS. How am I glutted with conceit of this!
     Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please,
     Resolve[26] me of all ambiguities,
     Perform what desperate enterprise I will?
     I'll have them fly to India for gold,
     Ransack the ocean for orient pearl,
     And search all corners of the new-found world
     For pleasant fruits and princely delicates;
     I'll have them read me strange philosophy,
     And tell the secrets of all foreign kings;
     I'll have them wall all Germany with brass,
     And make swift Rhine circle fair Wertenberg;
     I'll have them fill the public schools with silk,[27]
     Wherewith the students shall be bravely clad;
     I'll levy soldiers with the coin they bring,
     And chase the Prince of Parma from our land,
     And reign sole king of all the[28] provinces;
     Yea, stranger engines for the brunt of war,
     Than was the fiery keel at Antwerp's bridge,[29]
     I'll make my servile spirits to invent.

          Enter VALDES and CORNELIUS.

     Come, German Valdes, and Cornelius,
     And make me blest with your sage conference.
     Valdes, sweet Valdes, and Cornelius,
     Know that your words have won me at the last
     To practice magic and concealed arts:
     Yet not your words only,[30] but mine own fantasy,
     That will receive no object; for my head
     But ruminates on necromantic skill.
     Philosophy is odious and obscure;
     Both law and physic are for petty wits;
     Divinity is basest of the three,
     Unpleasant, harsh, contemptible, and vile:[31]
     'Tis magic, magic, that hath ravish'd me.
     Then, gentle friends, aid me in this attempt;
     And I, that have with concise syllogisms[32]
     Gravell'd the pastors of the German church,
     And made the flowering pride of Wertenberg
     Swarm to my problems, as the infernal spirits
     On sweet Musaeus when he came to hell,
     Will be as cunning[33] as Agrippa[34] was,
     Whose shadow[35] made all Europe honour him.

     VALDES. Faustus, these books, thy wit, and our experience,
     Shall make all nations to canonize us.
     As Indian Moors obey their Spanish lords,
     So shall the spirits[36] of every element
     Be always serviceable to us three;
     Like lions shall they guard us when we please;
     Like Almain rutters[37] with their horsemen's staves,
     Or Lapland giants, trotting by our sides;
     Sometimes like women, or unwedded maids,
     Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows
     Than have the[38] white breasts of the queen of love:
     From[39] Venice shall they drag huge argosies,
     And from America the golden fleece
     That yearly stuffs old Philip's treasury;
     If learned Faustus will be resolute.

     FAUSTUS. Valdes, as resolute am I in this
     As thou to live:  therefore object it not.

     CORNELIUS. The miracles that magic will perform
     Will make thee vow to study nothing else.
     He that is grounded in astrology,
     Enrich'd with tongues, well seen in[40] minerals,
     Hath all the principles magic doth require:
     Then doubt not, Faustus, but to be renowm'd,[41]
     And more frequented for this mystery
     Than heretofore the Delphian oracle.
     The spirits tell me they can dry the sea,
     And fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks,
     Ay, all the wealth that our forefathers hid
     Within the massy entrails of the earth:
     Then tell me, Faustus, what shall we three want?

     FAUSTUS. Nothing, Cornelius.  O, this cheers my soul!
     Come, shew me some demonstrations magical,
     That I may conjure in some lusty grove,
     And have these joys in full possession.

     VALDES. Then haste thee to some solitary grove,
     And bear wise Bacon's and Albertus'[42] works,
     The Hebrew Psalter, and New Testament;
     And whatsoever else is requisite
     We will inform thee ere our conference cease.

     CORNELIUS. Valdes, first let him know the words of art;
     And then, all other ceremonies learn'd,
     Faustus may try his cunning[43] by himself.

     VALDES. First I'll instruct thee in the rudiments,
     And then wilt thou be perfecter than I.

     FAUSTUS. Then come and dine with me, and, after meat,
     We'll canvass every quiddity thereof;
     For, ere I sleep, I'll try what I can do:
     This night I'll conjure, though I die therefore.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter two SCHOLARS.[44]

     FIRST SCHOLAR. I wonder what's become of Faustus, that was wont
     to make our schools ring with sic probo.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. That shall we know, for see, here comes his boy.

          Enter WAGNER.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. How now, sirrah! where's thy master?

     WAGNER. God in heaven knows.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Why, dost not thou know?

     WAGNER. Yes, I know; but that follows not.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Go to, sirrah! leave your jesting, and tell us
     where he is.

     WAGNER. That follows not necessary by force of argument, that you,
     being licentiates, should stand upon:[45]  therefore acknowledge
     your error, and be attentive.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Why, didst thou not say thou knewest?

     WAGNER. Have you any witness on't?

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Yes, sirrah, I heard you.

     WAGNER. Ask my fellow if I be a thief.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Well, you will not tell us?

     WAGNER. Yes, sir, I will tell you:  yet, if you were not dunces,
     you would never ask me such a question; for is not he corpus
     naturale? and is not that mobile? then wherefore should you
     ask me such a question?  But that I am by nature phlegmatic,
     slow to wrath, and prone to lechery (to love, I would say),
     it were not for you to come within forty foot of the place
     of execution, although I do not doubt to see you both hanged
     the next sessions.  Thus having triumphed over you, I will set
     my countenance like a precisian, and begin to speak thus:--
     Truly, my dear brethren, my master is within at dinner,
     with Valdes and Cornelius, as this wine, if it could speak,
     would[46] inform your worships:  and so, the Lord bless you,
     preserve you, and keep you, my dear brethren, my dear brethren![47]
          [Exit.]

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Nay, then, I fear he is fallen into that damned art
     for which they two are infamous through the world.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Were he a stranger, and not allied to me, yet should
     I grieve for him. But, come, let us go and inform the Rector,
     and see if he by his grave counsel can reclaim him.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. O, but I fear me nothing can reclaim him!

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet let us try what we can do.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FAUSTUS to conjure.[48]

     FAUSTUS. Now that the gloomy shadow of the earth,
     Longing to view Orion's drizzling look,
     Leaps from th' antartic world unto the sky,
     And dims the welkin with her pitchy breath,
     Faustus, begin thine incantations,
     And try if devils will obey thy hest,
     Seeing thou hast pray'd and sacrific'd to them.
     Within this circle is Jehovah's name,
     Forward and backward anagrammatiz'd,[49]
     Th' abbreviated[50] names of holy saints,
     Figures of every adjunct to the heavens,
     And characters of signs and erring[51] stars,
     By which the spirits are enforc'd to rise:
     Then fear not, Faustus, but be resolute,
     And try the uttermost magic can perform.--
     Sint mihi dei Acherontis propitii!  Valeat numen triplex Jehovoe!
     Ignei, aerii, aquatani spiritus, salvete!  Orientis princeps
     Belzebub, inferni ardentis monarcha, et Demogorgon, propitiamus
     vos, ut appareat et surgat Mephistophilis, quod tumeraris:[52]
     per Jehovam, Gehennam, et consecratam aquam quam nunc spargo,
     signumque crucis quod nunc facio, et per vota nostra, ipse nunc
     surgat nobis dicatus[53] Mephistophilis!

          Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     I charge thee to return, and change thy shape;
     Thou art too ugly to attend on me:
     Go, and return an old Franciscan friar;
     That holy shape becomes a devil best.
          [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]

     I see there's virtue in my heavenly words:
     Who would not be proficient in this art?
     How pliant is this Mephistophilis,
     Full of obedience and humility!
     Such is the force of magic and my spells:
     No, Faustus, thou art conjuror laureat,
     That canst command great Mephistophilis:
     Quin regis Mephistophilis fratris imagine.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS like a Franciscan friar.[54]

     MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?

     FAUSTUS. I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live,
     To do whatever Faustus shall command,
     Be it to make the moon drop from her sphere,
     Or the ocean to overwhelm the world.

     MEPHIST. I am a servant to great Lucifer,
     And may not follow thee without his leave:
     No more than he commands must we perform.

     FAUSTUS. Did not he charge thee to appear to me?

     MEPHIST. No, I came hither[55] of mine own accord.

     FAUSTUS. Did not my conjuring speeches raise thee? speak.

     MEPHIST. That was the cause, but yet per accidens;[56]
     For, when we hear one rack the name of God,
     Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ,
     We fly, in hope to get his glorious soul;
     Nor will we come, unless he use such means
     Whereby he is in danger to be damn'd.
     Therefore the shortest cut for conjuring
     Is stoutly to abjure the Trinity,
     And pray devoutly to the prince of hell.

     FAUSTUS. So Faustus hath
     Already done; and holds this principle,
     There is no chief but only Belzebub;
     To whom Faustus doth dedicate himself.
     This word "damnation" terrifies not him,
     For he confounds hell in Elysium:
     His ghost be with the old philosophers!
     But, leaving these vain trifles of men's souls,
     Tell me what is that Lucifer thy lord?

     MEPHIST. Arch-regent and commander of all spirits.

     FAUSTUS. Was not that Lucifer an angel once?

     MEPHIST. Yes, Faustus, and most dearly lov'd of God.

     FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that he is prince of devils?

     MEPHIST. O, by aspiring pride and insolence;
     For which God threw him from the face of heaven.

     FAUSTUS. And what are you that live with Lucifer?

     MEPHIST. Unhappy spirits that fell with Lucifer,
     Conspir'd against our God with Lucifer,
     And are for ever damn'd with Lucifer.

     FAUSTUS. Where are you damn'd?

     MEPHIST. In hell.

     FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that thou art out of hell?

     MEPHIST. Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it:[57]
     Think'st thou that I, who saw the face of God,
     And tasted the eternal joys of heaven,
     Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,
     In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss?
     O, Faustus, leave these frivolous demands,
     Which strike a terror to my fainting soul!

     FAUSTUS. What, is great Mephistophilis so passionate
     For being deprived of the joys of heaven?
     Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude,
     And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess.
     Go bear these[58] tidings to great Lucifer:
     Seeing Faustus hath incurr'd eternal death
     By desperate thoughts against Jove's[59] deity,
     Say, he surrenders up to him his soul,
     So he will spare him four and twenty[60] years,
     Letting him live in all voluptuousness;
     Having thee ever to attend on me,
     To give me whatsoever I shall ask,
     To tell me whatsoever I demand,
     To slay mine enemies, and aid my friends,
     And always be obedient to my will.
     Go and return to mighty Lucifer,
     And meet me in my study at midnight,
     And then resolve[61] me of thy master's mind.

     MEPHIST. I will, Faustus.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Had I as many souls as there be stars,
     I'd give them all for Mephistophilis.
     By him I'll be great emperor of the world,
     And make a bridge thorough[62] the moving air,
     To pass the ocean with a band of men;
     I'll join the hills that bind the Afric shore,
     And make that country[63] continent to Spain,
     And both contributory to my crown:
     The Emperor shall not live but by my leave,
     Nor any potentate of Germany.
     Now that I have obtain'd what I desir'd,[64]
     I'll live in speculation of this art,
     Till Mephistophilis return again.
          [Exit.]

          Enter WAGNER[65] and CLOWN.

     WAGNER. Sirrah boy, come hither.

     CLOWN. How, boy! swowns, boy!  I hope you have seen many boys
     with such pickadevaunts[66] as I have:  boy, quotha!

     WAGNER. Tell me, sirrah, hast thou any comings in?

     CLOWN. Ay, and goings out too; you may see else.

     WAGNER. Alas, poor slave! see how poverty jesteth in his nakedness!
     the villain is bare and out of service, and so hungry, that I know
     he would give his soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton,
     though it were blood-raw.

     CLOWN. How! my soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton, though
     'twere blood-raw! not so, good friend:  by'r lady,[67] I had need
     have it well roasted, and good sauce to it, if I pay so dear.

     WAGNER. Well, wilt thou serve me, and I'll make thee go like
     Qui mihi discipulus?[68]

     CLOWN. How, in verse?

     WAGNER. No, sirrah; in beaten silk and staves-acre.[69]

     CLOWN. How, how, knaves-acre! ay, I thought that was all the land
     his father left him.  Do you hear?  I would be sorry to rob you of
     your living.

     WAGNER. Sirrah, I say in staves-acre.

     CLOWN. Oho, oho, staves-acre! why, then, belike, if I were your
     man, I should be full of vermin.[70]

     WAGNER. So thou shalt, whether thou beest with me or no.  But,
     sirrah, leave your jesting, and bind yourself presently unto me
     for seven years, or I'll turn all the lice about thee into
     familiars,[71] and they shall tear thee in pieces.

     CLOWN. Do you hear, sir? you may save that labour; they are too
     familiar with me already:  swowns, they are as bold with my flesh
     as if they had paid for their[72] meat and drink.

     WAGNER. Well, do you hear, sirrah? hold, take these guilders.
          [Gives money.]

     CLOWN. Gridirons! what be they?

     WAGNER. Why, French crowns.

     CLOWN. Mass, but for the name of French crowns, a man were as good
     have as many English counters.  And what should I do with these?

     WAGNER. Why, now, sirrah, thou art at an hour's warning, whensoever
     or wheresoever the devil shall fetch thee.

     CLOWN. No, no; here, take your gridirons again.

     WAGNER. Truly, I'll none of them.

     CLOWN. Truly, but you shall.

     WAGNER. Bear witness I gave them him.

     CLOWN. Bear witness I give them you again.

     WAGNER. Well, I will cause two devils presently to fetch thee
     away.--Baliol and Belcher!

     CLOWN. Let your Baliol and your Belcher come here, and I'll
     knock them, they were never so knocked since they were devils:
     say I should kill one of them, what would folks say?  "Do ye see
     yonder tall fellow in the round slop?[73] he has killed the devil."
     So I should be called Kill-devil all the parish over.

          Enter two DEVILS; and the CLOWN runs up and down crying.

     WAGNER. Baliol and Belcher,--spirits, away!
          [Exeunt DEVILS.]

     CLOWN. What, are they gone? a vengeance on them! they have vile[74]
     long nails.  There was a he-devil and a she-devil:  I'll tell you
     how you shall know them; all he-devils has horns, and all
     she-devils has clifts and cloven feet.

     WAGNER. Well, sirrah, follow me.

     CLOWN. But, do you hear? if I should serve you, would you teach
     me to raise up Banios and Belcheos?

     WAGNER. I will teach thee to turn thyself to any thing, to a dog,
     or a cat, or a mouse, or a rat, or any thing.

     CLOWN. How! a Christian fellow to a dog, or a cat, a mouse,
     or a rat! no, no, sir; if you turn me into any thing, let it be
     in the likeness of a little pretty frisking flea, that I may be
     here and there and every where:  O, I'll tickle the pretty wenches'
     plackets!  I'll be amongst them, i'faith.

     WAGNER. Well, sirrah, come.

     CLOWN. But, do you hear, Wagner?

     WAGNER. How!--Baliol and Belcher!

     CLOWN. O Lord!  I pray, sir, let Banio and Belcher go sleep.

     WAGNER. Villain, call me Master Wagner, and let thy left eye be
     diametarily fixed upon my right heel, with quasi vestigiis
     nostris[75] insistere.
          [Exit.]

     CLOWN. God forgive me, he speaks Dutch fustian.  Well, I'll follow
     him; I'll serve him, that's flat.
          [Exit.]

          FAUSTUS discovered in his study.

     FAUSTUS. Now, Faustus, must
     Thou needs be damn'd, and canst thou not be sav'd:
     What boots it, then, to think of God or heaven?
     Away with such vain fancies, and despair;
     Despair in God, and trust in Belzebub:
     Now go not backward; no, Faustus, be resolute:
     Why waver'st thou?  O, something soundeth in mine ears,
     "Abjure this magic, turn to God again!"
     Ay, and Faustus will turn to God again.
     To God? he loves thee not;
     The god thou serv'st is thine own appetite,
     Wherein is fix'd the love of Belzebub:
     To him I'll build an altar and a church,
     And offer lukewarm blood of new-born babes.

          Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, leave that execrable art.

     FAUSTUS. Contrition, prayer, repentance--what of them?

     GOOD ANGEL. O, they are means to bring thee unto heaven!

     EVIL ANGEL. Rather illusions, fruits of lunacy,
     That make men foolish that do trust them most.

     GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, think of heaven and heavenly things.

     EVIL ANGEL. No, Faustus; think of honour and of[76] wealth.
          [Exeunt ANGELS.]

     FAUSTUS. Of wealth!
     Why, the signiory of Embden shall be mine.
     When Mephistophilis shall stand by me,
     What god can hurt thee, Faustus? thou art safe
     Cast no more doubts.--Come, Mephistophilis,
     And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--
     Is't not midnight?--come, Mephistophilis,
     Veni, veni, Mephistophile!

          Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     Now tell me[77] what says Lucifer, thy lord?

     MEPHIST. That I shall wait on Faustus whilst he lives,[78]
     So he will buy my service with his soul.

     FAUSTUS. Already Faustus hath hazarded that for thee.

     MEPHIST. But, Faustus, thou must bequeath it solemnly,
     And write a deed of gift with thine own blood;
     For that security craves great Lucifer.
     If thou deny it, I will back to hell.

     FAUSTUS. Stay, Mephistophilis, and tell me, what good will my soul
     do thy lord?

     MEPHIST. Enlarge his kingdom.

     FAUSTUS. Is that the reason why[79] he tempts us thus?

     MEPHIST. Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris.[80]

     FAUSTUS. Why,[81] have you any pain that torture[82] others!

     MEPHIST. As great as have the human souls of men.
     But, tell me, Faustus, shall I have thy soul?
     And I will be thy slave, and wait on thee,
     And give thee more than thou hast wit to ask.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, Mephistophilis, I give it thee.

     MEPHIST. Then, Faustus,[83] stab thine arm courageously,
     And bind thy soul, that at some certain day
     Great Lucifer may claim it as his own;
     And then be thou as great as Lucifer.

     FAUSTUS. [Stabbing his arm] Lo, Mephistophilis, for love of thee,
     I cut mine arm, and with my proper blood
     Assure my soul to be great Lucifer's,
     Chief lord and regent of perpetual night!
     View here the blood that trickles from mine arm,
     And let it be propitious for my wish.

     MEPHIST. But, Faustus, thou must
     Write it in manner of a deed of gift.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, so I will [Writes].  But, Mephistophilis,
     My blood congeals, and I can write no more.

     MEPHIST. I'll fetch thee fire to dissolve it straight.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. What might the staying of my blood portend?
     Is it unwilling I should write this bill?[84]
     Why streams it not, that I may write afresh?
     FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL:  ah, there it stay'd!
     Why shouldst thou not? is not thy soul shine own?
     Then write again, FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with a chafer of coals.

     MEPHIST. Here's fire; come, Faustus, set it on.[85]

     FAUSTUS. So, now the blood begins to clear again;
     Now will I make an end immediately.
          [Writes.]

     MEPHIST. O, what will not I do to obtain his soul?
          [Aside.]

     FAUSTUS. Consummatum est; this bill is ended,
     And Faustus hath bequeath'd his soul to Lucifer.
     But what is this inscription[86] on mine arm?
     Homo, fuge:  whither should I fly?
     If unto God, he'll throw me[87] down to hell.
     My senses are deceiv'd; here's nothing writ:--
     I see it plain; here in this place is writ,
     Homo, fuge:  yet shall not Faustus fly.

     MEPHIST. I'll fetch him somewhat to delight his mind.
          [Aside, and then exit.]

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with DEVILS, who give crowns
          and rich apparel to FAUSTUS, dance, and then depart.

     FAUSTUS. Speak, Mephistophilis, what means this show?

     MEPHIST. Nothing, Faustus, but to delight thy mind withal,
     And to shew thee what magic can perform.

     FAUSTUS. But may I raise up spirits when I please?

     MEPHIST. Ay, Faustus, and do greater things than these.

     FAUSTUS. Then there's enough for a thousand souls.
     Here, Mephistophilis, receive this scroll,
     A deed of gift of body and of soul:
     But yet conditionally that thou perform
     All articles prescrib'd between us both.

     MEPHIST. Faustus, I swear by hell and Lucifer
     To effect all promises between us made!

     FAUSTUS. Then hear me read them.  [Reads] ON THESE CONDITIONS
     FOLLOWING.  FIRST, THAT FAUSTUS MAY BE A SPIRIT IN FORM AND
     SUBSTANCE.  SECONDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL BE HIS SERVANT,
     AND AT HIS COMMAND.  THIRDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL DO FOR HIM,
     AND BRING HIM WHATSOEVER HE DESIRES.[88]  FOURTHLY, THAT HE SHALL
     BE IN HIS CHAMBER OR HOUSE INVISIBLE.  LASTLY, THAT HE SHALL APPEAR
     TO THE SAID JOHN FAUSTUS, AT ALL TIMES, IN WHAT FORM OR SHAPE
     SOEVER HE PLEASE.  I, JOHN FAUSTUS, OF WERTENBERG, DOCTOR, BY
     THESE PRESENTS, DO GIVE BOTH BODY AND SOUL TO LUCIFER PRINCE OF
     THE EAST, AND HIS MINISTER MEPHISTOPHILIS; AND FURTHERMORE GRANT
     UNTO THEM, THAT,[89] TWENTY-FOUR YEARS BEING EXPIRED, THE ARTICLES
     ABOVE-WRITTEN INVIOLATE, FULL POWER TO FETCH OR CARRY THE SAID
     JOHN FAUSTUS, BODY AND SOUL, FLESH, BLOOD, OR GOODS, INTO THEIR
     HABITATION WHERESOEVER.  BY ME, JOHN FAUSTUS.

     MEPHIST. Speak, Faustus, do you deliver this as your deed?

     FAUSTUS. Ay, take it, and the devil give thee good on't!

     MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, ask what thou wilt.

     FAUSTUS. First will I question with thee about hell.
     Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?

     MEPHIST. Under the heavens.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, but whereabout?

     MEPHIST. Within the bowels of these[90] elements,
     Where we are tortur'd and remain for ever:
     Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd
     In one self place; for where we are is hell,
     And where hell is, there[91] must we ever be:
     And, to conclude, when all the world dissolves,
     And every creature shall be purified,
     All places shall be hell that are[92] not heaven.

     FAUSTUS. Come, I think hell's a fable.

     MEPHIST. Ay, think so still, till experience change thy mind.

     FAUSTUS. Why, think'st thou, then, that Faustus shall be damn'd?

     MEPHIST. Ay, of necessity, for here's the scroll
     Wherein thou hast given thy soul to Lucifer.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, and body too:  but what of that?
     Think'st thou that Faustus is so fond[93] to imagine
     That, after this life, there is any pain?
     Tush, these are trifles and mere old wives' tales.

     MEPHIST. But, Faustus, I am an instance to prove the contrary,
     For I am damn'd, and am now in hell.

     FAUSTUS. How! now in hell!
     Nay, an this be hell, I'll willingly be damn'd here:
     What! walking, disputing, &c.[94]
     But, leaving off this, let me have a wife,[95]
     The fairest maid in Germany;
     For I am wanton and lascivious,
     And cannot live without a wife.

     MEPHIST. How! a wife!
     I prithee, Faustus, talk not of a wife.

     FAUSTUS. Nay, sweet Mephistophilis, fetch me one, for I will have
     one.

     MEPHIST. Well, thou wilt have one?  Sit there till I come:  I'll
     fetch thee a wife in the devil's name.
          [Exit.]

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with a DEVIL drest like a WOMAN,
          with fire-works.

     MEPHIST. Tell me,[96] Faustus, how dost thou like thy wife?

     FAUSTUS. A plague on her for a hot whore!

     MEPHIST. Tut, Faustus,
     Marriage is but a ceremonial toy;
     If thou lovest me, think no[97] more of it.
     I'll cull thee out the fairest courtezans,
     And bring them every morning to thy bed:
     She whom thine eye shall like, thy heart shall have,
     Be she as chaste as was Penelope,
     As wise as Saba,[98] or as beautiful
     As was bright Lucifer before his fall.
     Hold, take this book, peruse it thoroughly:
          [Gives book.]

     The iterating[99] of these lines brings gold;
     The framing of this circle on the ground
     Brings whirlwinds, tempests, thunder, and lightning;
     Pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself,
     And men in armour shall appear to thee,
     Ready to execute what thou desir'st.

     FAUSTUS. Thanks, Mephistophilis:  yet fain would I have a book
     wherein I might behold all spells and incantations, that I
     might raise up spirits when I please.

     MEPHIST. Here they are in this book.
          [Turns to them.]

     FAUSTUS. Now would I have a book where I might see all characters
     and planets of the heavens, that I might know their motions and
     dispositions.

     MEPHIST. Here they are too.
          [Turns to them.]

     FAUSTUS. Nay, let me have one book more,--and then I have done,--
     wherein I might see all plants, herbs, and trees, that grow upon
     the earth.

     MEPHIST. Here they be.

     FAUSTUS. O, thou art deceived.

     MEPHIST. Tut, I warrant thee.
          [Turns to them.]

     FAUSTUS. When I behold the heavens, then I repent,
     And curse thee, wicked Mephistophilis,
     Because thou hast depriv'd me of those joys.

     MEPHIST. Why, Faustus,
     Thinkest thou heaven is such a glorious thing?
     I tell thee, 'tis not half so fair as thou,
     Or any man that breathes on earth.

     FAUSTUS. How prov'st thou that?

     MEPHIST. 'Twas made for man, therefore is man more excellent.

     FAUSTUS. If it were made for man, 'twas made for me:
     I will renounce this magic and repent.

          Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     GOOD ANGEL. Faustus, repent; yet God will pity thee.

     EVIL ANGEL. Thou art a spirit; God cannot pity thee.

     FAUSTUS. Who buzzeth in mine ears I am a spirit?
     Be I a devil, yet God may pity me;
     Ay, God will pity me, if I repent.

     EVIL ANGEL. Ay, but Faustus never shall repent.
          [Exeunt ANGELS.]

     FAUSTUS. My heart's so harden'd, I cannot repent:
     Scarce can I name salvation, faith, or heaven,
     But fearful echoes thunder in mine ears,
     "Faustus, thou art damn'd!" then swords, and knives,
     Poison, guns, halters, and envenom'd steel
     Are laid before me to despatch myself;
     And long ere this I should have slain myself,
     Had not sweet pleasure conquer'd deep despair.
     Have not I made blind Homer sing to me
     Of Alexander's love and Oenon's death?
     And hath not he, that built the walls of Thebes
     With ravishing sound of his melodious harp,
     Made music with my Mephistophilis?
     Why should I die, then, or basely despair?
     I am resolv'd; Faustus shall ne'er repent.--
     Come, Mephistophilis, let us dispute again,
     And argue of divine astrology.[100]
     Tell me, are there many heavens above the moon
     Are all celestial bodies but one globe,
     As is the substance of this centric earth?

     MEPHIST. As are the elements, such are the spheres,
     Mutually folded in each other's orb,
     And, Faustus,
     All jointly move upon one axletree,
     Whose terminine is term'd the world's wide pole;
     Nor are the names of Saturn, Mars, or Jupiter
     Feign'd, but are erring[101] stars.

     FAUSTUS. But, tell me, have they all one motion, both situ et
     tempore?

     MEPHIST. All jointly move from east to west in twenty-four hours
     upon the poles of the world; but differ in their motion upon
     the poles of the zodiac.

     FAUSTUS. Tush,
     These slender trifles Wagner can decide:
     Hath Mephistophilis no greater skill?
     Who knows not the double motion of the planets?
     The first is finish'd in a natural day;
     The second thus; as Saturn in thirty years; Jupiter in twelve;
     Mars in four; the Sun, Venus, and Mercury in a year; the Moon in
     twenty-eight days.  Tush, these are freshmen's[102] suppositions.
     But, tell me, hath every sphere a dominion or intelligentia?

     MEPHIST. Ay.

     FAUSTUS. How many heavens or spheres are there?

     MEPHIST. Nine; the seven planets, the firmament, and the empyreal
     heaven.

     FAUSTUS. Well, resolve[103] me in this question; why have we not
     conjunctions, oppositions, aspects, eclipses, all at one time,
     but in some years we have more, in some less?

     MEPHIST. Per inoequalem motum respectu totius.

     FAUSTUS. Well, I am answered.  Tell me who made the world?

     MEPHIST. I will not.

     FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, tell me.

     MEPHIST. Move me not, for I will not tell thee.

     FAUSTUS. Villain, have I not bound thee to tell me any thing?

     MEPHIST. Ay, that is not against our kingdom; but this is.  Think
     thou on hell, Faustus, for thou art damned.

     FAUSTUS. Think, Faustus, upon God that made the world.

     MEPHIST. Remember this.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Ay, go, accursed spirit, to ugly hell!
     'Tis thou hast damn'd distressed Faustus' soul.
     Is't not too late?

          Re-enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     EVIL ANGEL. Too late.

     GOOD ANGEL. Never too late, if Faustus can repent.

     EVIL ANGEL. If thou repent, devils shall tear thee in pieces.

     GOOD ANGEL. Repent, and they shall never raze thy skin.
          [Exeunt ANGELS.]

     FAUSTUS. Ah, Christ, my Saviour,
     Seek to save[104] distressed Faustus' soul!

          Enter LUCIFER, BELZEBUB, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     LUCIFER. Christ cannot save thy soul, for he is just:
     There's none but I have interest in the same.

     FAUSTUS. O, who art thou that look'st so terrible?

     LUCIFER. I am Lucifer,
     And this is my companion-prince in hell.

     FAUSTUS. O, Faustus, they are come to fetch away thy soul!

     LUCIFER. We come to tell thee thou dost injure us;
     Thou talk'st of Christ, contrary to thy promise:
     Thou shouldst not think of God:  think of the devil,
     And of his dam too.

     FAUSTUS. Nor will I henceforth:  pardon me in this,
     And Faustus vows never to look to heaven,
     Never to name God, or to pray to him,
     To burn his Scriptures, slay his ministers,
     And make my spirits pull his churches down.

     LUCIFER. Do so, and we will highly gratify thee.  Faustus, we are
     come from hell to shew thee some pastime:  sit down, and thou
     shalt see all the Seven Deadly Sins appear in their proper shapes.

     FAUSTUS. That sight will be as pleasing unto me,
     As Paradise was to Adam, the first day
     Of his creation.

     LUCIFER. Talk not of Paradise nor creation; but mark this show:
     talk of the devil, and nothing else.--Come away!

          Enter the SEVEN DEADLY SINS.[105]

     Now, Faustus, examine them of their several names and dispositions.

     FAUSTUS. What art thou, the first?

     PRIDE. I am Pride.  I disdain to have any parents.  I am like to
     Ovid's flea; I can creep into every corner of a wench; sometimes,
     like a perriwig, I sit upon her brow; or, like a fan of feathers,
     I kiss her lips; indeed, I do--what do I not?  But, fie, what a
     scent is here!  I'll not speak another word, except the ground
     were perfumed, and covered with cloth of arras.

     FAUSTUS. What art thou, the second?

     COVETOUSNESS. I am Covetousness, begotten of an old churl, in an
     old leathern bag:  and, might I have my wish, I would desire that
     this house and all the people in it were turned to gold, that I
     might lock you up in my good chest:  O, my sweet gold!

     FAUSTUS. What art thou, the third?

     WRATH. I am Wrath.  I had neither father nor mother:  I leapt out
     of a lion's mouth when I was scarce half-an-hour old; and ever
     since I have run up and down the world with this case[106]
     of rapiers, wounding myself when I had nobody to fight withal.
     I was born in hell; and look to it, for some of you shall be
     my father.

     FAUSTUS. What art thou, the fourth?

     ENVY. I am Envy, begotten of a chimney-sweeper and an oyster-wife.
     I cannot read, and therefore wish all books were burnt.  I am lean
     with seeing others eat.  O, that there would come a famine through
     all the world, that all might die, and I live alone! then thou
     shouldst see how fat I would be.  But must thou sit, and I stand?
     come down, with a vengeance!

     FAUSTUS. Away, envious rascal!--What art thou, the fifth?

     GLUTTONY. Who I, sir?  I am Gluttony.  My parents are all dead,
     and the devil a penny they have left me, but a bare pension, and
     that is thirty meals a-day and ten bevers,[107]--a small trifle
     to suffice nature.  O, I come of a royal parentage! my grandfather
     was a Gammon of Bacon, my grandmother a Hogshead of Claret-wine;
     my godfathers were these, Peter Pickle-herring and Martin
     Martlemas-beef; O, but my godmother, she was a jolly gentlewoman,
     and well-beloved in every good town and city; her name was Mistress
     Margery March-beer.  Now, Faustus, thou hast heard all my progeny;
     wilt thou bid me to supper?

     FAUSTUS. No, I'll see thee hanged:  thou wilt eat up all my victuals.

     GLUTTONY. Then the devil choke thee!

     FAUSTUS. Choke thyself, glutton!--What art thou, the sixth?

     SLOTH. I am Sloth.  I was begotten on a sunny bank, where I have
     lain ever since; and you have done me great injury to bring me
     from thence:  let me be carried thither again by Gluttony and
     Lechery.  I'll not speak another word for a king's ransom.

     FAUSTUS. What are you, Mistress Minx, the seventh and last?

     LECHERY. Who I, sir?  I am one that loves an inch of raw mutton
     better than an ell of fried stock-fish; and the first letter
     of my name begins with L.[108]

     FAUSTUS. Away, to hell, to hell![109]
          [Exeunt the SINS.]

     LUCIFER. Now, Faustus, how dost thou like this?

     FAUSTUS. O, this feeds my soul!

     LUCIFER. Tut, Faustus, in hell is all manner of delight.

     FAUSTUS. O, might I see hell, and return again,
     How happy were I then!

     LUCIFER. Thou shalt; I will send for thee at midnight.[110]
     In meantime take this book; peruse it throughly,
     And thou shalt turn thyself into what shape thou wilt.

     FAUSTUS. Great thanks, mighty Lucifer!
     This will I keep as chary as my life.

     LUCIFER. Farewell, Faustus, and think on the devil.

     FAUSTUS. Farewell, great Lucifer.
          [Exeunt LUCIFER and BELZEBUB.]

     Come, Mephistophilis.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter CHORUS.[111]

     CHORUS. Learned Faustus,
     To know the secrets of astronomy[112]
     Graven in the book of Jove's high firmament,
     Did mount himself to scale Olympus' top,
     Being seated in a chariot burning bright,
     Drawn by the strength of yoky dragons' necks.
     He now is gone to prove cosmography,
     And, as I guess, will first arrive at Rome,
     To see the Pope and manner of his court,
     And take some part of holy Peter's feast,
     That to this day is highly solemniz'd.
          [Exit.]

          Enter FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS.[113]

     FAUSTUS. Having now, my good Mephistophilis,
     Pass'd with delight the stately town of Trier,[114]
     Environ'd round with airy mountain-tops,
     With walls of flint, and deep-entrenched lakes,
     Not to be won by any conquering prince;
     From Paris next,[115] coasting the realm of France,
     We saw the river Maine fall into Rhine,
     Whose banks are set with groves of fruitful vines;
     Then up to Naples, rich Campania,
     Whose buildings fair and gorgeous to the eye,
     The streets straight forth, and pav'd with finest brick,
     Quarter the town in four equivalents:
     There saw we learned Maro's golden tomb,
     The way he cut,[116] an English mile in length,
     Thorough a rock of stone, in one night's space;
     From thence to Venice, Padua, and the rest,
     In one of which a sumptuous temple stands,[117]
     That threats the stars with her aspiring top.
     Thus hitherto hath Faustus spent his time:
     But tell me now what resting-place is this?
     Hast thou, as erst I did command,
     Conducted me within the walls of Rome?

     MEPHIST. Faustus, I have; and, because we will not be unprovided,
     I have taken up his Holiness' privy-chamber for our use.

     FAUSTUS. I hope his Holiness will bid us welcome.

     MEPHIST.
     Tut, 'tis no matter; man; we'll be bold with his good cheer.
     And now, my Faustus, that thou mayst perceive
     What Rome containeth to delight thee with,
     Know that this city stands upon seven hills
     That underprop the groundwork of the same:
     Just through the midst[118] runs flowing Tiber's stream
     With winding banks that cut it in two parts;
     Over the which four stately bridges lean,
     That make safe passage to each part of Rome:
     Upon the bridge call'd Ponte[119] Angelo
     Erected is a castle passing strong,
     Within whose walls such store of ordnance are,
     And double cannons fram'd of carved brass,
     As match the days within one complete year;
     Besides the gates, and high pyramides,
     Which Julius Caesar brought from Africa.

     FAUSTUS. Now, by the kingdoms of infernal rule,
     Of Styx, of[120] Acheron, and the fiery lake
     Of ever-burning Phlegethon, I swear
     That I do long to see the monuments
     And situation of bright-splendent Rome:
     Come, therefore, let's away.

     MEPHIST. Nay, Faustus, stay:  I know you'd fain see the Pope,
     And take some part of holy Peter's feast,
     Where thou shalt see a troop of bald-pate friars,
     Whose summum bonum is in belly-cheer.

     FAUSTUS. Well, I'm content to compass then some sport,
     And by their folly make us merriment.
     Then charm me, that I[121]
     May be invisible, to do what I please,
     Unseen of any whilst I stay in Rome.
          [Mephistophilis charms him.]

     MEPHIST. So, Faustus; now
     Do what thou wilt, thou shalt not be discern'd.

          Sound a Sonnet.[122] Enter the POPE and the CARDINAL OF
          LORRAIN to the banquet, with FRIARS attending.

     POPE. My Lord of Lorrain, will't please you draw near?

     FAUSTUS. Fall to, and the devil choke you, an you spare!

     POPE. How now! who's that which spake?--Friars, look about.

     FIRST FRIAR. Here's nobody, if it like your Holiness.

     POPE. My lord, here is a dainty dish was sent me from the Bishop
     of Milan.

     FAUSTUS. I thank you, sir.
          [Snatches the dish.]

     POPE. How now! who's that which snatched the meat from me? will
     no man look?--My lord, this dish was sent me from the Cardinal
     of Florence.

     FAUSTUS. You say true; I'll ha't.
          [Snatches the dish.]

     POPE. What, again!--My lord, I'll drink to your grace.

     FAUSTUS. I'll pledge your grace.
          [Snatches the cup.]

     C. OF LOR. My lord, it may be some ghost, newly crept out of
     Purgatory, come to beg a pardon of your Holiness.

     POPE. It may be so.--Friars, prepare a dirge to lay the fury
     of this ghost.--Once again, my lord, fall to.
          [The POPE crosses himself.]

     FAUSTUS. What, are you crossing of yourself?
     Well, use that trick no more, I would advise you.
          [The POPE crosses himself again.]

     Well, there's the second time.  Aware the third;
     I give you fair warning.
          [The POPE crosses himself again, and FAUSTUS hits him a box
           of the ear; and they all run away.]

     Come on, Mephistophilis; what shall we do?

     MEPHIST. Nay, I know not:  we shall be cursed with bell, book,
     and candle.

     FAUSTUS. How! bell, book, and candle,--candle, book, and bell,--
     Forward and backward, to curse Faustus to hell!
     Anon you shall hear a hog grunt, a calf bleat, and an ass bray,
     Because it is Saint Peter's holiday.

          Re-enter all the FRIARS to sing the Dirge.

     FIRST FRIAR.
     Come, brethren, let's about our business with good devotion.

          They sing.

     CURSED BE HE THAT STOLE AWAY HIS HOLINESS' MEAT FROM THE
     TABLE!  maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT STRUCK HIS HOLINESS A BLOW ON THE FACE!
     maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT TOOK FRIAR SANDELO A BLOW ON THE PATE!
     maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT DISTURBETH OUR HOLY DIRGE!  maledicat
     Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT TOOK AWAY HIS HOLINESS' WINE!  maledicat
     Dominus?  ['?' sic]
          Et omnes Sancti!  Amen!

          [MEPHISTOPHILIS and FAUSTUS beat the FRIARS, and fling
           fire-works among them; and so exeunt.]

          Enter CHORUS.

     CHORUS. When Faustus had with pleasure ta'en the view
     Of rarest things, and royal courts of kings,
     He stay'd his course, and so returned home;
     Where such as bear his absence but with grief,
     I mean his friends and near'st companions,
     Did gratulate his safety with kind words,
     And in their conference of what befell,
     Touching his journey through the world and air,
     They put forth questions of astrology,
     Which Faustus answer'd with such learned skill
     As they admir'd and wonder'd at his wit.
     Now is his fame spread forth in every land:
     Amongst the rest the Emperor is one,
     Carolus the Fifth, at whose palace now
     Faustus is feasted 'mongst his noblemen.
     What there he did, in trial of his art,
     I leave untold; your eyes shall see['t] perform'd.
          [Exit.]

          Enter ROBIN[123] the Ostler, with a book in his hand.

     ROBIN. O, this is admirable! here I ha' stolen one of Doctor
     Faustus' conjuring-books, and, i'faith, I mean to search some
     circles for my own use.  Now will I make all the maidens in our
     parish dance at my pleasure, stark naked, before me; and so
     by that means I shall see more than e'er I felt or saw yet.

          Enter RALPH, calling ROBIN.

     RALPH. Robin, prithee, come away; there's a gentleman tarries
     to have his horse, and he would have his things rubbed and made
     clean:  he keeps such a chafing with my mistress about it; and
     she has sent me to look thee out; prithee, come away.

     ROBIN. Keep out, keep out, or else you are blown up, you are
     dismembered, Ralph:  keep out, for I am about a roaring piece
     of work.

     RALPH. Come, what doest thou with that same book? thou canst
     not read?

     ROBIN. Yes, my master and mistress shall find that I can read,
     he for his forehead, she for her private study; she's born to
     bear with me, or else my art fails.

     RALPH. Why, Robin, what book is that?

     ROBIN. What book! why, the most intolerable book for conjuring
     that e'er was invented by any brimstone devil.

     RALPH. Canst thou conjure with it?

     ROBIN. I can do all these things easily with it; first, I can
     make thee drunk with ippocras[124] at any tabern[125] in Europe
     for nothing; that's one of my conjuring works.

     RALPH. Our Master Parson says that's nothing.

     ROBIN. True, Ralph:  and more, Ralph, if thou hast any mind to
     Nan Spit, our kitchen-maid, then turn her and wind her to thy own
     use, as often as thou wilt, and at midnight.

     RALPH. O, brave, Robin! shall I have Nan Spit, and to mine own
     use?  On that condition I'll feed thy devil with horse-bread as
     long as he lives, of free cost.

     ROBIN. No more, sweet Ralph:  let's go and make clean our boots,
     which lie foul upon our hands, and then to our conjuring in the
     devil's name.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter ROBIN and RALPH[126] with a silver goblet.

     ROBIN. Come, Ralph:  did not I tell thee, we were for ever made
     by this Doctor Faustus' book? ecce, signum! here's a simple
     purchase[127] for horse-keepers:  our horses shall eat no hay as
     long as this lasts.

     RALPH. But, Robin, here comes the Vintner.

     ROBIN. Hush!  I'll gull him supernaturally.

          Enter VINTNER.

     Drawer,[128] I hope all is paid; God be with you!--Come, Ralph.

     VINTNER. Soft, sir; a word with you.  I must yet have a goblet paid
     from you, ere you go.

     ROBIN. I a goblet, Ralph, I a goblet!--I scorn you; and you are
     but a, &c.  I a goblet! search me.

     VINTNER. I mean so, sir, with your favour.
          [Searches ROBIN.]

     ROBIN. How say you now?

     VINTNER. I must say somewhat to your fellow.--You, sir!

     RALPH. Me, sir! me, sir! search your fill.  [VINTNER searches him.]
     Now, sir, you may be ashamed to burden honest men with a matter
     of truth.

     VINTNER. Well, tone[129] of you hath this goblet about you.

     ROBIN. You lie, drawer, 'tis afore me [Aside].--Sirrah you, I'll
     teach you to impeach honest men;--stand by;--I'll scour you for
     a goblet;--stand aside you had best, I charge you in the name of
     Belzebub.--Look to the goblet, Ralph [Aside to RALPH].

     VINTNER. What mean you, sirrah?

     ROBIN. I'll tell you what I mean.  [Reads from a book] Sanctobulorum
     Periphrasticon--nay, I'll tickle you, Vintner.--Look to the goblet,
     Ralph [Aside to RALPH].--[Reads] Polypragmos Belseborams framanto
     pacostiphos tostu, Mephistophilis, &c.

          Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS, sets squibs at their backs, and then
          exit.  They run about.

     VINTNER. O, nomine Domini! what meanest thou, Robin? thou hast no
     goblet.

     RALPH. Peccatum peccatorum!--Here's thy goblet, good Vintner.
          [Gives the goblet to VINTNER, who exit.]

     ROBIN. Misericordia pro nobis! what shall I do?  Good devil, forgive
     me now, and I'll never rob thy library more.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     MEPHIST. Monarch of Hell,[130] under whose black survey
     Great potentates do kneel with awful fear,
     Upon whose altars thousand souls do lie,
     How am I vexed with these villains' charms?
     From Constantinople am I hither come,
     Only for pleasure of these damned slaves.

     ROBIN. How, from Constantinople! you have had a great journey:
     will you take sixpence in your purse to pay for your supper, and
     be gone?

     MEPHIST. Well, villains, for your presumption, I transform thee
     into an ape, and thee into a dog; and so be gone!
          [Exit.]

     ROBIN. How, into an ape! that's brave:  I'll have fine sport with
     the boys; I'll get nuts and apples enow.

     RALPH. And I must be a dog.

     ROBIN. I'faith, thy head will never be out of the pottage-pot.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter EMPEROR,[131] FAUSTUS, and a KNIGHT, with ATTENDANTS.

     EMPEROR. Master Doctor Faustus,[132] I have heard strange report
     of thy knowledge in the black art, how that none in my empire
     nor in the whole world can compare with thee for the rare effects
     of magic:  they say thou hast a familiar spirit, by whom thou canst
     accomplish what thou list.  This, therefore, is my request, that
     thou let me see some proof of thy skill, that mine eyes may be
     witnesses to confirm what mine ears have heard reported:  and here
     I swear to thee, by the honour of mine imperial crown, that,
     whatever thou doest, thou shalt be no ways prejudiced or endamaged.

     KNIGHT. I'faith, he looks much like a conjurer.
          [Aside.]

     FAUSTUS. My gracious sovereign, though I must confess myself far
     inferior to the report men have published, and nothing answerable
     to the honour of your imperial majesty, yet, for that love and duty
     binds me thereunto, I am content to do whatsoever your majesty
     shall command me.

     EMPEROR. Then, Doctor Faustus, mark what I shall say.
     As I was sometime solitary set
     Within my closet, sundry thoughts arose
     About the honour of mine ancestors,
     How they had won[133] by prowess such exploits,
     Got such riches, subdu'd so many kingdoms,
     As we that do succeed,[134] or they that shall
     Hereafter possess our throne, shall
     (I fear me) ne'er attain to that degree
     Of high renown and great authority:
     Amongst which kings is Alexander the Great,
     Chief spectacle of the world's pre-eminence,
     The bright[135] shining of whose glorious acts
     Lightens the world with his reflecting beams,
     As when I hear but motion made of him,
     It grieves my soul I never saw the man:
     If, therefore, thou, by cunning of thine art,
     Canst raise this man from hollow vaults below,
     Where lies entomb'd this famous conqueror,
     And bring with him his beauteous paramour,
     Both in their right shapes, gesture, and attire
     They us'd to wear during their time of life,
     Thou shalt both satisfy my just desire,
     And give me cause to praise thee whilst I live.

     FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, I am ready to accomplish your request,
     so far forth as by art and power of my spirit I am able to perform.

     KNIGHT. I'faith, that's just nothing at all.
          [Aside.]

     FAUSTUS. But, if it like your grace, it is not in my ability[136]
     to present before your eyes the true substantial bodies of those
     two deceased princes, which long since are consumed to dust.

     KNIGHT. Ay, marry, Master Doctor, now there's a sign of grace in
     you, when you will confess the truth.
          [Aside.]

     FAUSTUS. But such spirits as can lively resemble Alexander and
     his paramour shall appear before your grace, in that manner that
     they both[137] lived in, in their most flourishing estate; which
     I doubt not shall sufficiently content your imperial majesty.

     EMPEROR. Go to, Master Doctor; let me see them presently.

     KNIGHT. Do you hear, Master Doctor? you bring Alexander and his
     paramour before the Emperor!

     FAUSTUS. How then, sir?

     KNIGHT. I'faith, that's as true as Diana turned me to a stag.

     FAUSTUS. No, sir; but, when Actaeon died, he left the horns for
     you.--Mephistophilis, be gone.
          [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]

     KNIGHT. Nay, an you go to conjuring, I'll be gone.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. I'll meet with you anon for interrupting me so.
     --Here they are, my gracious lord.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with SPIRITS in the shapes of ALEXANDER
          and his PARAMOUR.

     EMPEROR. Master Doctor, I heard this lady, while she lived, had a
     wart or mole in her neck:  how shall I know whether it be so or no?

     FAUSTUS. Your highness may boldly go and see.

     EMPEROR. Sure, these are no spirits, but the true substantial
     bodies of those two deceased princes.
          [Exeunt Spirits.]

     FAUSTUS. Wilt please your highness now to send for the knight
     that was so pleasant with me here of late?

     EMPEROR. One of you call him forth.
          [Exit ATTENDANT.]

          Re-enter the KNIGHT with a pair of horns on his head.

     How now, sir knight! why, I had thought thou hadst been a bachelor,
     but now I see thou hast a wife, that not only gives thee horns,
     but makes thee wear them.  Feel on thy head.

     KNIGHT. Thou damned wretch and execrable dog,
     Bred in the concave of some monstrous rock,
     How dar'st thou thus abuse a gentleman?
     Villain, I say, undo what thou hast done!

     FAUSTUS. O, not so fast, sir! there's no haste:  but, good, are
     you remembered how you crossed me in my conference with the
     Emperor?  I think I have met with you for it.

     EMPEROR. Good Master Doctor, at my entreaty release him:  he hath
     done penance sufficient.

     FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, not so much for the injury he offered
     me here in your presence, as to delight you with some mirth, hath
     Faustus worthily requited this injurious knight; which being all
     I desire, I am content to release him of his horns:--and,
     sir knight, hereafter speak well of scholars.--Mephistophilis,
     transform him straight.[138]  [MEPHISTOPHILIS removes the horns.]
     --Now, my good lord, having done my duty, I humbly take my leave.

     EMPEROR. Farewell, Master Doctor:  yet, ere you go,
     Expect from me a bounteous reward.
          [Exeunt EMPEROR, KNIGHT, and ATTENDANTS.]

     FAUSTUS. Now, Mephistophilis,[139] the restless course
     That time doth run with calm and silent foot,
     Shortening my days and thread of vital life,
     Calls for the payment of my latest years:
     Therefore, sweet Mephistophilis, let us
     Make haste to Wertenberg.

     MEPHIST. What, will you go on horse-back or on foot[?]

     FAUSTUS. Nay, till I'm past this fair and pleasant green,
     I'll walk on foot.

          Enter a HORSE-COURSER.[140]

     HORSE-COURSER. I have been all this day seeking one Master Fustian:
     mass, see where he is!--God save you, Master Doctor!

     FAUSTUS. What, horse-courser! you are well met.

     HORSE-COURSER. Do you hear, sir?  I have brought you forty dollars
     for your horse.

     FAUSTUS. I cannot sell him so:  if thou likest him for fifty, take
     him.

     HORSE-COURSER. Alas, sir, I have no more!--I pray you, speak for
     me.

     MEPHIST. I pray you, let him have him:  he is an honest fellow,
     and he has a great charge, neither wife nor child.

     FAUSTUS. Well, come, give me your money [HORSE-COURSER gives
     FAUSTUS the money]:  my boy will deliver him to you.  But I must
     tell you one thing before you have him; ride him not into the
     water, at any hand.

     HORSE-COURSER. Why, sir, will he not drink of all waters?

     FAUSTUS. O, yes, he will drink of all waters; but ride him not
     into the water:  ride him over hedge or ditch, or where thou wilt,
     but not into the water.

     HORSE-COURSER. Well, sir.--Now am I made man for ever:  I'll not
     leave my horse for forty:[141]  if he had but the quality of
     hey-ding-ding, hey-ding-ding, I'd make a brave living on him:
     he has a buttock as slick as an eel [Aside].--Well, God b'wi'ye,
     sir:  your boy will deliver him me:  but, hark you, sir; if my horse
     be sick or ill at ease, if I bring his water to you, you'll tell
     me what it is?

     FAUSTUS. Away, you villain! what, dost think I am a horse-doctor?
          [Exit HORSE-COURSER.]

     What art thou, Faustus, but a man condemn'd to die?
     Thy fatal time doth draw to final end;
     Despair doth drive distrust into[142] my thoughts:
     Confound these passions with a quiet sleep:
     Tush, Christ did call the thief upon the Cross;
     Then rest thee, Faustus, quiet in conceit.
          [Sleeps in his chair.]

          Re-enter HORSE-COURSER, all wet, crying.

     HORSE-COURSER. Alas, alas!  Doctor Fustian, quoth a? mass, Doctor
     Lopus[143] was never such a doctor:  has given me a purgation, has
     purged me of forty dollars; I shall never see them more.  But yet,
     like an ass as I was, I would not be ruled by him, for he bade me
     I should ride him into no water:  now I, thinking my horse had had
     some rare quality that he would not have had me know of,[144] I,
     like a venturous youth, rid him into the deep pond at the town's
     end.  I was no sooner in the middle of the pond, but my horse
     vanished away, and I sat upon a bottle of hay, never so near
     drowning in my life.  But I'll seek out my doctor, and have my
     forty dollars again, or I'll make it the dearest horse!--O,
     yonder is his snipper-snapper.--Do you hear? you, hey-pass,[145]
     where's your master?

     MEPHIST. Why, sir, what would you? you cannot speak with him.

     HORSE-COURSER. But I will speak with him.

     MEPHIST. Why, he's fast asleep:  come some other time.

     HORSE-COURSER. I'll speak with him now, or I'll break his
     glass-windows about his ears.

     MEPHIST. I tell thee, he has not slept this eight nights.

     HORSE-COURSER. An he have not slept this eight weeks, I'll
     speak with him.

     MEPHIST. See, where he is, fast asleep.

     HORSE-COURSER. Ay, this is he.--God save you, Master Doctor,
     Master Doctor, Master Doctor Fustian! forty dollars, forty dollars
     for a bottle of hay!

     MEPHIST. Why, thou seest he hears thee not.

     HORSE-COURSER. So-ho, ho! so-ho, ho!  [Hollows in his ear.]  No,
     will you not wake?  I'll make you wake ere I go.  [Pulls FAUSTUS
     by the leg, and pulls it away.]  Alas, I am undone! what shall
     I do?

     FAUSTUS. O, my leg, my leg!--Help, Mephistophilis! call the
     officers.--My leg, my leg!

     MEPHIST. Come, villain, to the constable.

     HORSE-COURSER. O Lord, sir, let me go, and I'll give you forty
     dollars more!

     MEPHIST. Where be they?

     HORSE-COURSER. I have none about me:  come to my ostry,[146]
     and I'll give them you.

     MEPHIST. Be gone quickly.
          [HORSE-COURSER runs away.]

     FAUSTUS. What, is he gone? farewell he!  Faustus has his leg again,
     and the Horse-courser, I take it, a bottle of hay for his labour:
     well, this trick shall cost him forty dollars more.

          Enter WAGNER.

     How now, Wagner! what's the news with thee?

     WAGNER. Sir, the Duke of Vanholt doth earnestly entreat your
     company.

     FAUSTUS. The Duke of Vanholt! an honourable gentleman, to whom
     I must be no niggard of my cunning.[147]--Come, Mephistophilis,
     let's away to him.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter the DUKE OF VANHOLT, the DUCHESS, and FAUSTUS.[148]

     DUKE. Believe me, Master Doctor, this merriment hath much pleased
     me.

     FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, I am glad it contents you so well.
     --But it may be, madam, you take no delight in this.  I have heard
     that great-bellied women do long for some dainties or other:  what
     is it, madam? tell me, and you shall have it.

     DUCHESS. Thanks, good Master Doctor:  and, for I see your courteous
     intent to pleasure me, I will not hide from you the thing my heart
     desires; and, were it now summer, as it is January and the dead
     time of the winter, I would desire no better meat than a dish
     of ripe grapes.

     FAUSTUS. Alas, madam, that's nothing!--Mephistophilis, be gone.
     [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.] Were it a greater thing than this, so it
     would content you, you should have it.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with grapes.

     Here they be, madam:  wilt please you taste on them?

     DUKE. Believe me, Master Doctor, this makes me wonder above the
     rest, that being in the dead time of winter and in the month of
     January, how you should come by these grapes.

     FAUSTUS. If it like your grace, the year is divided into two
     circles over the whole world, that, when it is here winter with
     us, in the contrary circle it is summer with them, as in India,
     Saba,[149] and farther countries in the east; and by means of a
     swift spirit that I have, I had them brought hither, as you see.
     --How do you like them, madam? be they good?

     DUCHESS. Believe me, Master Doctor, they be the best grapes that
     e'er I tasted in my life before.

     FAUSTUS. I am glad they content you so, madam.

     DUKE. Come, madam, let us in, where you must well reward this
     learned man for the great kindness he hath shewed to you.

     DUCHESS. And so I will, my lord; and, whilst I live, rest
     beholding[150] for this courtesy.

     FAUSTUS. I humbly thank your grace.

     DUKE. Come, Master Doctor, follow us, and receive your reward.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter WAGNER.[151]

     WAGNER. I think my master means to die shortly,
     For he hath given to me all his goods:[152]
     And yet, methinks, if that death were near,
     He would not banquet, and carouse, and swill
     Amongst the students, as even now he doth,
     Who are at supper with such belly-cheer
     As Wagner ne'er beheld in all his life.
     See, where they come! belike the feast is ended.
          [Exit.]

          Enter FAUSTUS with two or three SCHOLARS, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Master Doctor Faustus, since our conference about
     fair ladies, which was the beautifulest in all the world, we have
     determined with ourselves that Helen of Greece was the admirablest
     lady that ever lived:  therefore, Master Doctor, if you will do us
     that favour, as to let us see that peerless dame of Greece, whom
     all the world admires for majesty, we should think ourselves much
     beholding unto you.

     FAUSTUS. Gentlemen,
     For that I know your friendship is unfeign'd,
     And Faustus' custom is not to deny
     The just requests of those that wish him well,
     You shall behold that peerless dame of Greece,
     No otherways for pomp and majesty
     Than when Sir Paris cross'd the seas with her,
     And brought the spoils to rich Dardania.
     Be silent, then, for danger is in words.
          [Music sounds, and HELEN passeth over the stage.[153]]

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Too simple is my wit to tell her praise,
     Whom all the world admires for majesty.

     THIRD SCHOLAR. No marvel though the angry Greeks pursu'd
     With ten years' war the rape of such a queen,
     Whose heavenly beauty passeth all compare.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Since we have seen the pride of Nature's works,
     And only paragon of excellence,
     Let us depart; and for this glorious deed
     Happy and blest be Faustus evermore!

     FAUSTUS. Gentlemen, farewell:  the same I wish to you.
          [Exeunt SCHOLARS.]

          Enter an OLD MAN.[154]

     OLD MAN. Ah, Doctor Faustus, that I might prevail
     To guide thy steps unto the way of life,
     By which sweet path thou mayst attain the goal
     That shall conduct thee to celestial rest!
     Break heart, drop blood, and mingle it with tears,
     Tears falling from repentant heaviness
     Of thy most vile[155] and loathsome filthiness,
     The stench whereof corrupts the inward soul
     With such flagitious crimes of heinous sin[156]
     As no commiseration may expel,
     But mercy, Faustus, of thy Saviour sweet,
     Whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt.

     FAUSTUS. Where art thou, Faustus? wretch, what hast thou done?
     Damn'd art thou, Faustus, damn'd; despair and die!
     Hell calls for right, and with a roaring voice
     Says, "Faustus, come; thine hour is almost[157] come;"
     And Faustus now[158] will come to do thee right.
          [MEPHISTOPHILIS gives him a dagger.]

     OLD MAN. Ah, stay, good Faustus, stay thy desperate steps!
     I see an angel hovers o'er thy head,
     And, with a vial full of precious grace,
     Offers to pour the same into thy soul:
     Then call for mercy, and avoid despair.

     FAUSTUS. Ah, my sweet friend, I feel
     Thy words to comfort my distressed soul!
     Leave me a while to ponder on my sins.

     OLD MAN. I go, sweet Faustus; but with heavy cheer,
     Fearing the ruin of thy hopeless soul.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Accursed Faustus, where is mercy now?
     I do repent; and yet I do despair:
     Hell strives with grace for conquest in my breast:
     What shall I do to shun the snares of death?

     MEPHIST. Thou traitor, Faustus, I arrest thy soul
     For disobedience to my sovereign lord:
     Revolt, or I'll in piece-meal tear thy flesh.

     FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, entreat thy lord
     To pardon my unjust presumption,
     And with my blood again I will confirm
     My former vow I made to Lucifer.

     MEPHIST. Do it, then, quickly,[159] with unfeigned heart,
     Lest greater danger do attend thy drift.

     FAUSTUS. Torment, sweet friend, that base and crooked age,
     That durst dissuade me from thy Lucifer,
     With greatest torments that our hell affords.

     MEPHIST. His faith is great; I cannot touch his soul;
     But what I may afflict his body with
     I will attempt, which is but little worth.

     FAUSTUS. One thing, good servant,[160] let me crave of thee,
     To glut the longing of my heart's desire,--
     That I might have unto my paramour
     That heavenly Helen which I saw of late,
     Whose sweet embracings may extinguish clean
     Those[161] thoughts that do dissuade me from my vow,
     And keep mine oath I made to Lucifer.

     MEPHIST. Faustus, this,[162] or what else thou shalt desire,
     Shall be perform'd in twinkling of an eye.

          Re-enter HELEN.

     FAUSTUS. Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships,
     And burnt the topless[163] towers of Ilium--
     Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.--
          [Kisses her.]
     Her lips suck forth my soul:  see, where it flies!--
     Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.
     Here will I dwell, for heaven is[164] in these lips,
     And all is dross that is not Helena.
     I will be Paris, and for love of thee,
     Instead of Troy, shall Wertenberg be sack'd;
     And I will combat with weak Menelaus,
     And wear thy colours on my plumed crest;
     Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel,
     And then return to Helen for a kiss.
     O, thou art fairer than the evening air
     Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;
     Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter
     When he appear'd to hapless Semele;
     More lovely than the monarch of the sky
     In wanton Arethusa's azur'd arms;
     And none but thou shalt[165] be my paramour!
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter the OLD MAN.[166]

     OLD MAN. Accursed Faustus, miserable man,
     That from thy soul exclud'st the grace of heaven,
     And fly'st the throne of his tribunal-seat!

          Enter DEVILS.

     Satan begins to sift me with his pride:
     As in this furnace God shall try my faith,
     My faith, vile hell, shall triumph over thee.
     Ambitious fiends, see how the heavens smile
     At your repulse, and laugh your state to scorn!
     Hence, hell! for hence I fly unto my God.
          [Exeunt,--on one side, DEVILS, on the other, OLD MAN.]

          Enter FAUSTUS,[167] with SCHOLARS.

     FAUSTUS. Ah, gentlemen!

     FIRST SCHOLAR. What ails Faustus?

     FAUSTUS. Ah, my sweet chamber-fellow, had I lived with thee,
     then had I lived still! but now I die eternally.  Look, comes
     he not? comes he not?

     SECOND SCHOLAR. What means Faustus?

     THIRD SCHOLAR. Belike he is grown into some sickness by being
     over-solitary.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. If it be so, we'll have physicians to cure him.
     --'Tis but a surfeit; never fear, man.

     FAUSTUS. A surfeit of deadly sin, that hath damned both body
     and soul.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet, Faustus, look up to heaven; remember God's
     mercies are infinite.

     FAUSTUS. But Faustus' offence can ne'er be pardoned:  the serpent
     that tempted Eve may be saved, but not Faustus.  Ah, gentlemen,
     hear me with patience, and tremble not at my speeches!  Though
     my heart pants and quivers to remember that I have been a student
     here these thirty years, O, would I had never seen Wertenberg,
     never read book! and what wonders I have done, all Germany can
     witness, yea, all the world; for which Faustus hath lost both
     Germany and the world, yea, heaven itself, heaven, the seat of
     God, the throne of the blessed, the kingdom of joy; and must
     remain in hell for ever, hell, ah, hell, for ever!  Sweet friends,
     what shall become of Faustus, being in hell for ever?

     THIRD SCHOLAR. Yet, Faustus, call on God.

     FAUSTUS. On God, whom Faustus hath abjured! on God, whom Faustus
     hath blasphemed!  Ah, my God, I would weep! but the devil draws in
     my tears.  Gush forth blood, instead of tears! yea, life and soul!
     O, he stays my tongue!  I would lift up my hands; but see, they
     hold them, they hold them!

     ALL. Who, Faustus?

     FAUSTUS. Lucifer and Mephistophilis.  Ah, gentlemen, I gave them
     my soul for my cunning![168]

     ALL. God forbid!

     FAUSTUS. God forbade it, indeed; but Faustus hath done it:  for
     vain pleasure of twenty-four years hath Faustus lost eternal joy
     and felicity.  I writ them a bill with mine own blood:  the date
     is expired; the time will come, and he will fetch me.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Why did not Faustus tell us of this before,[169]
     that divines might have prayed for thee?

     FAUSTUS. Oft have I thought to have done so; but the devil
     threatened to tear me in pieces, if I named God, to fetch both
     body and soul, if I once gave ear to divinity:  and now 'tis too
     late.  Gentlemen, away, lest you perish with me.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. O, what shall we do to save[170] Faustus?

     FAUSTUS. Talk not of me, but save yourselves, and depart.

     THIRD SCHOLAR. God will strengthen me; I will stay with Faustus.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Tempt not God, sweet friend; but let us into the
     next room, and there pray for him.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, pray for me, pray for me; and what noise soever
     ye hear,[171] come not unto me, for nothing can rescue me.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Pray thou, and we will pray that God may have
     mercy upon thee.

     FAUSTUS. Gentlemen, farewell:  if I live till morning, I'll visit
     you; if not, Faustus is gone to hell.

     ALL. Faustus, farewell.
          [Exeunt SCHOLARS.--The clock strikes eleven.]

     FAUSTUS. Ah, Faustus,
     Now hast thou but one bare hour to live,
     And then thou must be damn'd perpetually!
     Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven,
     That time may cease, and midnight never come;
     Fair Nature's eye, rise, rise again, and make
     Perpetual day; or let this hour be but
     A year, a month, a week, a natural day,
     That Faustus may repent and save his soul!
     O lente,[172] lente currite, noctis equi!
     The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike,
     The devil will come, and Faustus must be damn'd.
     O, I'll leap up to my God!--Who pulls me down?--
     See, see, where Christ's blood streams in the firmament!
     One drop would save my soul, half a drop:  ah, my Christ!--
     Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ!
     Yet will I call on him:  O, spare me, Lucifer!--
     Where is it now? 'tis gone:  and see, where God
     Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows!
     Mountains and hills, come, come, and fall on me,
     And hide me from the heavy wrath of God!
     No, no!
     Then will I headlong run into the earth:
     Earth, gape!  O, no, it will not harbour me!
     You stars that reign'd at my nativity,
     Whose influence hath allotted death and hell,
     Now draw up Faustus, like a foggy mist.
     Into the entrails of yon labouring cloud[s],
     That, when you[173] vomit forth into the air,
     My limbs may issue from your smoky mouths,
     So that my soul may but ascend to heaven!
          [The clock strikes the half-hour.]
     Ah, half the hour is past! 'twill all be past anon
     O God,
     If thou wilt not have mercy on my soul,
     Yet for Christ's sake, whose blood hath ransom'd me,
     Impose some end to my incessant pain;
     Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years,
     A hundred thousand, and at last be sav'd!
     O, no end is limited to damned souls!
     Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul?
     Or why is this immortal that thou hast?
     Ah, Pythagoras' metempsychosis, were that true,
     This soul should fly from me, and I be chang'd
     Unto some brutish beast![174] all beasts are happy,
     For, when they die,
     Their souls are soon dissolv'd in elements;
     But mine must live still to be plagu'd in hell.
     Curs'd be the parents that engender'd me!
     No, Faustus, curse thyself, curse Lucifer
     That hath depriv'd thee of the joys of heaven.
          [The clock strikes twelve.]
     O, it strikes, it strikes!  Now, body, turn to air,
     Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell!
          [Thunder and lightning.]
     O soul, be chang'd into little water-drops,
     And fall into the ocean, ne'er be found!

          Enter DEVILS.

     My God, my god, look not so fierce on me!
     Adders and serpents, let me breathe a while!
     Ugly hell, gape not! come not, Lucifer!
     I'll burn my books!--Ah, Mephistophilis!
          [Exeunt DEVILS with FAUSTUS.]  [175]

          Enter CHORUS.

     CHORUS. Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight,
     And burned is Apollo's laurel-bough,
     That sometime grew within this learned man.
     Faustus is gone:  regard his hellish fall,
     Whose fiendful fortune may exhort the wise,
     Only to wonder at unlawful things,
     Whose deepness doth entice such forward wits
     To practice more than heavenly power permits.
          [Exit.]

[Footnote 29: the fiery keel at Antwerp's bridge-- During the blockade
of Antwerp by the Prince of Parma in 1585, "They of Antuerpe
knowing that the bridge and the Stocadoes were finished,
made a great shippe, to be a meanes to breake all this worke
of the prince of Parmaes:  this great shippe was made of masons
worke within, in the manner of a vaulted caue:  vpon the hatches
there were layed myll-stones, graue-stones, and others of great
weight; and within the vault were many barrels of powder, ouer
the which there were holes, and in them they had put matches,
hanging at a thred, the which burning vntill they came vnto
the thred, would fall into the powder, and so blow vp all.
And for that they could not haue any one in this shippe to
conduct it, Lanckhaer, a sea captaine of the Hollanders, being
then in Antuerpe, gaue them counsell to tye a great beame at the
end of it, to make it to keepe a straight course in the middest
of the streame.  In this sort floated this shippe the fourth of
Aprill, vntill that it came vnto the bridge; where (within a
while after) the powder wrought his effect, with such violence,
as the vessell, and all that was within it, and vpon it, flew in
pieces, carrying away a part of the Stocado and of the bridge.
The marquesse of Roubay Vicont of Gant, Gaspar of Robles lord of
Billy, and the Seignior of Torchies, brother vnto the Seignior
of Bours, with many others, were presently slaine; which were

Mephistophilis in "a thicke wood neere to Wittenberg, called
in the German tongue Spisser Wolt.....  Presently, not three
fathom above his head, fell a flame in manner of a lightning,
and changed itselfe into a globe.....  Suddenly the globe opened,
and sprung up in the height of a man; so burning a time, in the
end it converted to the shape of a fiery man[?-- This pleasant
beast ran about the circle a great while, and, lastly, appeared
in the manner of a Gray Fryer, asking Faustus what was his
request?" Sigs. A 2, A 3, ed. 1648.  Again; "After Doctor Faustus
had made his promise to the devill, in the morning betimes he
called the spirit before him, and commanded him that he should
alwayes come to him like a fryer after the order of Saint Francis,
with a bell in his hand like Saint Anthony, and to ring it once
or twice before he appeared, that he might know of his certaine

of a beare," &c.--"after him came Beelzebub, in curled haire of
a horseflesh colour," &c.--"then came Astaroth, in the forme of

of Maine falls into the Rhine:  notwithstanding he tarried not
long there, but went into Campania, in the kingdome of Neapol,
in which he saw an innumerable sort of cloysters, nunries, and
churches, and great houses of stone, the streets faire and large,
and straight forth from one end of the towne to the other as a
line; and all the pavement of the city was of bricke, and the
more it rained into the towne, the fairer the streets were:
there saw he the tombe of Virgill, and the highway that he cu[t]

of an English mile," &c. Sig. E 2, ed. 1648.]

[Footnote 116: The way he cut, &c.-- During the middle ages Virgil was
regarded as a great magician, and much was written concerning
his exploits in that capacity.  The LYFE OF VIRGILIUS, however,
(see Thoms's EARLY PROSE ROMANCES, vol. ii.,) makes no mention
of the feat in question.  But Petrarch speaks of it as follows.
"Non longe a Puteolis Falernus collis attollitur, famoso palmite
nobilis.  Inter Falernum et mare mons est saxeus, hominum manibus
confossus, quod vulgus insulsum a Virgilio magicis cantaminibus

[Footnote 136: But, if it like your grace, it is not in my ability, &c.]
"D. Faustus answered, My most excellent lord, I am ready to
accomplish your request in all things, so farre forth as I and
my spirit are able to performe:  yet your majesty shall know that
their dead bodies are not able substantially to be brought before
you; but such spirits as have seene Alexander and his Paramour
alive shall appeare unto you, in manner and form as they both
lived in their most flourishing time; and herewith I hope to
please your Imperiall Majesty.  Then Faustus went a little aside
to speake to his spirit; but he returned againe presently, saying,
Now, if it please your Majesty, you shall see them; yet, upon this
condition, that you demand no question of them, nor speake unto
them; which the Emperor agreed unto.  Wherewith Doctor Faustus opened
the privy-chamber doore, where presently entered the great and mighty
emperor Alexander Magnus, in all things to looke upon as if he
had beene alive; in proportion, a strong set thicke man, of a
middle stature, blacke haire, and that both thicke and curled,
head and beard, red cheekes, and a broad face, with eyes like
a basiliske; he had a compleat harnesse (i.e. suit of armour)
burnished and graven, exceeding rich to look upon:  and so,
passing towards the Emperor Carolus, he made low and reverend
courtesie:  whereat the Emperour Carolus would have stood up to
receive and greet him with the like reverence; but Faustus tooke
hold on him, and would not permit him to doe it.  Shortly after,
Alexander made humble reverence, and went out againe; and comming
to the doore, his paramour met him.  She comming in made the Emperour
likewise reverence:  she was cloathed in blew velvet, wrought and
imbroidered with pearls and gold; she was also excellent faire,
like milke and blood mixed, tall and slender, with a face round
as an apple.  And thus passed [she-- certaine times up and downe
the house; which the Emperor marking, said to himselfe, Now have
I seene two persons which my heart hath long wished to behold;
and sure it cannot otherwise be (said he to himselfe) but that
the spirits have changed themselves into these formes, and have
but deceived me, calling to minde the woman that raised the prophet
Samuel:  and for that the Emperor would be the more satisfied in
the matter, he said, I have often heard that behind, in her neck,
she had a great wart or wen; wherefore he tooke Faustus by the
hand without any words, and went to see if it were also to be
seene on her or not; but she, perceiving that he came to her,
bowed downe her neck, when he saw a great wart; and hereupon she
vanished, leaving the Emperor and the rest well contented."

[Footnote 137: both-- Old ed. "best."]

[Footnote 138: Mephistophilis, transform him straight-- According to THE
HISTORY OF DR. FAUSTUS, the knight was not present during Faustus's
"conference" with the Emperor; nor did he offer the doctor any
insult by doubting his skill in magic.  We are there told that
Faustus happening to see the knight asleep, "leaning out of a
window of the great hall," fixed a huge pair of hart's horns on
his head; "and, as the knight awaked, thinking to pull in his head,
he hit his hornes against the glasse, that the panes thereof flew
about his eares:  thinke here how this good gentleman was vexed,
for he could neither get backward nor forward."  After the emperor
and the courtiers, to their great amusement, had beheld the poor
knight in this condition, Faustus removed the horns.  When Faustus,
having taken leave of the emperor, was a league and a half from
the city, he was attacked in a wood by the knight and some of his
companions:  they were in armour, and mounted on fair palfreys;
but the doctor quickly overcame them by turning all the bushes
into horsemen, and "so charmed them, that every one, knight and
other, for the space of a whole moneth, did weare a paire of
goates hornes on their browes, and every palfry a paire of oxe
hornes on his head; and this was their penance appointed by
Faustus."  A second attempt of the knight to revenge himself on
Faustus proved equally unsuccessful.  Sigs. G 2, I 3, ed. 1648.]

chapter (the 34th) of THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS:  "After this

In the later 4tos a scene intervenes between the "Exeunt" of
Faustus, Mephistophilis, and Wagner, and the entrance of the Duke
of Vanholt, &c.--We are to suppose that Faustus is now at the court
of the Duke of Vanholt:  this is plain, not only from the later 4tos,
--in which Wagner tells Faustus that the Duke "hath sent some of
his men to attend him, with provision fit for his journey,"--but
from THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS, the subjoined portion of which
is closely followed in the present scene.  "Chap. xxxix. HOW DOCTOR
FAUSTUS PLAYED A MERRY JEST WITH THE DUKE OF ANHOLT IN HIS COURT.
Doctor Faustus on a time went to the Duke of Anholt, who welcommed
him very courteously; this was the moneth of January; where sitting
at the table, he perceived the dutchess to be with child; and
forbearing himselfe untill the meat was taken from the table,
and that they brought in the banqueting dishes [i.e. the dessert--,
Doctor Faustus said to the dutchesse, Gratious lady, I have alwayes
heard that great-bellied women doe alwayes long for some dainties;
I beseech therefore your grace, hide not your minde from me, but
tell me what you desire to eat.  She answered him, Doctor Faustus,
now truly I will not hide from you what my heart doth most desire;
namely, that, if it were now harvest, I would eat my bellyfull of
grapes and other dainty fruit.  Doctor Faustus answered hereupon,
Gracious lady, this is a small thing for me to doe, for I can doe
more than this.  Wherefore he tooke a plate, and set open one of
the casements of the window, holding it forth; where incontinent
he had his dish full of all manner of fruit, as red and white
grapes, peares, and apples, the which came from out of strange
countries:  all these he presented the dutchesse, saying, Madam,
I pray you vouchsafe to taste of this dainty fruit, the which
came from a farre countrey, for there the summer is not yet ended.
The dutchesse thanked Faustus highly, and she fell to her fruit
with full appetite.  The Duke of Anholt notwithstanding could not
withhold to ask Faustus with what reason there were such young
fruit to be had at that time of the yeare.  Doctor Faustus told
him, May it please your grace to understand that the year is
divided into two circles of the whole world, that when with us it
is winter, in the contrary circle it is notwithstanding summer;
for in India and Saba there falleth or setteth the sunne, so that
it is so warm that they have twice a yeare fruit; and, gracious
lord, I have a swift spirit, the which can in the twinkling of
an eye fulfill my desire in any thing; wherefore I sent him into
those countries, who hath brought this fruit as you see:  whereat
the duke was in great admiration."]

[Footnote 153: HELEN passeth over the stage-- In THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR
FAUSTUS we have the following description of Helen.  "This lady
appeared before them in a most rich gowne of purple velvet, costly
imbrodered; her haire hanged downe loose, as faire as the beaten
gold, and of such length that it reached downe to her hammes;
having most amorous cole-black eyes, a sweet and pleasant round
face, with lips as red as a cherry; her cheekes of a rose colour,
her mouth small, her neck white like a swan; tall and slender of
personage; in summe, there was no imperfect place in her:  she
looked round about with a rolling hawkes eye, a smiling and
wanton countenance, which neere-hand inflamed the hearts of all
the students; but that they perswaded themselves she was a spirit,

wrote the second time with his owne blood, and gave it to the
Devill."]

[Footnote 160: One thing, good servant, &c.-- "To the end that this miserable
Faustus might fill the lust of his flesh and live in all manner
of voluptuous pleasure, it came in his mind, after he had slept
his first sleepe, and in the 23 year past of his time, that he
had a great desire to lye with faire Helena of Greece, especially
her whom he had seen and shewed unto the students at Wittenberg:
wherefore he called unto his spirit Mephostophiles, commanding him
to bring to him the faire Helena; which he also did.  Whereupon he
fell in love with her, and made her his common concubine and
bed-fellow; for she was so beautifull and delightfull a peece,
that he could not be one houre from her, if he should therefore
have suffered death, she had so stoln away his heart:  and, to
his seeming, in time she was with childe, whom Faustus named
Justus Faustus.  The childe told Doctor Faustus many things which
were don in forraign countrys; but in the end, when Faustus lost
his life, the mother and the childe vanished away both together."

[Footnote 166: Enter the OLD MAN-- Scene, a room in the Old Man's house.
--In THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS the Old Man makes himself very
merry with the attempts of the evil powers to hurt him.  "About
two dayes after that he had exhorted Faustus, as the poore man
lay in his bed, suddenly there was a mighty rumbling in the
chamber, the which he was never wont to heare, and he heard as
it had beene the groaning of a sow, which lasted long:  whereupon
the good old man began to jest and mocke, and said, Oh, what a
barbarian cry is this?  Oh faire bird, what foul musicke is this?
A[h--, faire angell, that could not tarry two dayes in his place!
beginnest thou now to runne into a poore mans house, where thou
hast no power, and wert not able to keepe thy owne two dayes?
With these and such like words the spirit departed," &c.

[Footnote 168: cunning-- i.e. knowledge, skill.]

[Footnote 169: Why did not Faustus tell us of this before, &c.-- "Wherefore
one of them said unto him, Ah, friend Faustus, what have you done
to conceale this matter so long from us?  We would, by the helpe
of good divines and the grace of God, have brought you out of this
net, and have torne you out of the bondage and chaines of Satan;
whereas now we feare it is too late, to the utter ruine both of
your body and soule.  Doctor Faustus answered, I durst never doe
it, although I often minded to settle my life [myself?-- to godly
people to desire counsell and helpe; and once mine old neighbour
counselled me that I should follow his learning and leave all my
conjurations:  yet, when I was minded to amend and to follow that
good mans counsell, then came the Devill and would have had me
away, as this night he is like to doe, and said, so soone as I
turned againe to God, he would dispatch me altogether."  THE

[Footnote 175: Exeunt DEVILS with FAUSTUS-- In THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS,
his "miserable and lamentable end" is described as follows:  it
took place, we are informed, at "the village called Rimlich,
halfe a mile from Wittenberg."--"The students and the other that
were there, when they had prayed for him, they wept, and so went
forth; but Faustus tarried in the hall; and when the gentlemen
were laid in bed, none of them could sleepe, for that they att[e--nded
to heare if they might be privy of his end.  It happened that
betweene twelve and one a clocke at midnight, there blew a mighty
storme of winde against the house, as though it would have blowne
the foundation thereof out of his place.  Hereupon the students
began to feare and goe out of their beds, comforting one another;
but they would not stirre out of the chamber; and the host of
the house ran out of doores, thinking the house would fall.  The
students lay neere unto the hall wherein Doctor Faustus lay, and
they heard a mighty noyse and hissing, as if the hall had beene
full of snakes and adders.  With that, the hall-doore flew open,
wherein Doctor Faustus was, that he began to cry for helpe,
saying, Murther, murther! but it came forth with halfe a voyce,
hollowly:  shortly after, they heard him no more.  But when it was
day, the students, that had taken no rest that night, arose and
went into the hall, in the which they left Doctor Faustus; where
notwithstanding they found not Faustus, but all the hall lay
sprinkled with blood, his braines cleaving to the wall, for the
devill had beaten him from one wall against another; in one corner
lay his eyes, in another his teeth; a pittifull and fearefull
sight to behold.  Then began the students to waile and weepe for
him, and sought for his body in many places.  Lastly, they came
into the yard, where they found his body lying on the horse-dung,
most monstrously torne and fearefull to behold, for his head and
all his joynts were dashed in peeces.  The fore-named students and
masters that were at his death, have obtained so much, that they
buried him in the village where he was so grievously tormented.
After the which they returned to Wittenberg; and comming into the
house of Faustus, they found the servant of Faustus very sad,
unto whom they opened all the matter, who tooke it exceeding
heavily.  There found they also this history of Doctor Faustus
noted and of him written, as is before declared, all save only
his end, the which was after by the students thereto annexed;
further, what his servant had noted thereof, was made in another
booke.  And you have heard that he held by him in his life the
spirit of faire Helena, the which had by him one sonne, the which
he named Justus Faustus:  even the same day of his death they
vanished away, both mother and sonne.  The house before was so
darke that scarce any body could abide therein.  The same night
Doctor Faustus appeared unto his servant lively, and shewed unto
him many secret things, the which he had done and hidden in his
lifetime.  Likewise there were certaine which saw Doctor Faustus
looke out of the window by night, as they passed by the house."

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

TO MY WORTHY FRIEND, MASTER THOMAS HAMMON, of GRAY'S INN, ETC.

This play, composed by so worthy an author as Master Marlowe, and the
part of the Jew presented by so unimitable an actor as Master Alleyn,
being in this later age commended to the stage; as I ushered it unto the
court, and presented it to the Cock-pit, with these Prologues and
Epilogues here inserted, so now being newly brought to the press, I was
loath it should be published without the ornament of an Epistle; making
choice of you unto whom to devote it; than whom (of all those gentlemen
and acquaintance within the compass of my long knowledge) there is none
more able to tax ignorance, or attribute right to merit. Sir, you have
been pleased to grace some of mine own works [1] with your courteous
patronage:  I hope this will not be the worse accepted, because
commended by me; over whom none can claim more power or privilege than
yourself.  I had no better a new-year's gift to present you with;
receive it therefore as a continuance of that inviolable obligement, by
which he rests still engaged, who, as he ever hath, shall always remain,

     Tuissimus,
          Tho. Heywood. [2]





THE PROLOGUE SPOKEN AT COURT.

     Gracious and great, that we so boldly dare
     ('Mongst other plays that now in fashion are)
     To present this, writ many years agone,
     And in that age thought second unto none,
     We humbly crave your pardon.  We pursue
     The story of a rich and famous Jew
     Who liv'd in Malta:  you shall find him still,
     In all his projects, a sound Machiavill;
     And that's his character.  He that hath past
     So many censures [3] is now come at last
     To have your princely ears:  grace you him; then
     You crown the action, and renown the pen.




EPILOGUE SPOKEN AT COURT.

     It is our fear, dread sovereign, we have bin [4]
     Too tedious; neither can't be less than sin
     To wrong your princely patience:  if we have,
     Thus low dejected, we your pardon crave;
     And, if aught here offend your ear or sight,
     We only act and speak what others write.




THE PROLOGUE TO THE STAGE, AT THE COCK-PIT.

     We know not how our play may pass this stage,
     But by the best of poets [5] in that age
     THE MALTA-JEW had being and was made;
     And he then by the best of actors [6] play'd:
     In HERO AND LEANDER [7] one did gain
     A lasting memory; in Tamburlaine,
     This Jew, with others many, th' other wan
     The attribute of peerless, being a man
     Whom we may rank with (doing no one wrong)
     Proteus for shapes, and Roscius for a tongue,--
     So could he speak, so vary; nor is't hate
     To merit in him [8] who doth personate
     Our Jew this day; nor is it his ambition
     To exceed or equal, being of condition
     More modest:  this is all that he intends,
     (And that too at the urgence of some friends,)
     To prove his best, and, if none here gainsay it,
     The part he hath studied, and intends to play it.




EPILOGUE TO THE STAGE, AT THE COCK-PIT.

     In graving with Pygmalion to contend,
     Or painting with Apelles, doubtless the end
     Must be disgrace:  our actor did not so,--
     He only aim'd to go, but not out-go.
     Nor think that this day any prize was play'd; [9]
     Here were no bets at all, no wagers laid: [10]
     All the ambition that his mind doth swell,
     Is but to hear from you (by me) 'twas well.

THE JEW OF MALTA.

          Enter MACHIAVEL.

     MACHIAVEL. Albeit the world think Machiavel is dead,
     Yet was his soul but flown beyond the Alps;
     And, now the Guise [11] is dead, is come from France,
     To view this land, and frolic with his friends.
     To some perhaps my name is odious;
     But such as love me, guard me from their tongues,
     And let them know that I am Machiavel,
     And weigh not men, and therefore not men's words.
     Admir'd I am of those that hate me most:
     Though some speak openly against my books,
     Yet will they read me, and thereby attain
     To Peter's chair; and, when they cast me off,
     Are poison'd by my climbing followers.
     I count religion but a childish toy,
     And hold there is no sin but ignorance.
     Birds of the air will tell of murders past!
     I am asham'd to hear such fooleries.
     Many will talk of title to a crown:
     What right had Caesar to the empery? [12]
     Might first made kings, and laws were then most sure
     When, like the Draco's, [13] they were writ in blood.
     Hence comes it that a strong-built citadel
     Commands much more than letters can import:
     Which maxim had [14] Phalaris observ'd,
     H'ad never bellow'd, in a brazen bull,
     Of great ones' envy:  o' the poor petty wights
     Let me be envied and not pitied.
     But whither am I bound?  I come not, I,
     To read a lecture here [15] in Britain,
     But to present the tragedy of a Jew,
     Who smiles to see how full his bags are cramm'd;
     Which money was not got without my means.
     I crave but this,--grace him as he deserves,
     And let him not be entertain'd the worse
     Because he favours me.
          [Exit.]




ACT I. [16]

          BARABAS discovered in his counting-house, with heaps
          of gold before him.

     BARABAS. So that of thus much that return was made;
     And of the third part of the Persian ships
     There was the venture summ'd and satisfied.
     As for those Samnites, [17] and the men of Uz,
     That bought my Spanish oils and wines of Greece,
     Here have I purs'd their paltry silverlings. [18]
     Fie, what a trouble 'tis to count this trash!
     Well fare the Arabians, who so richly pay
     The things they traffic for with wedge of gold,
     Whereof a man may easily in a day
     Tell [19] that which may maintain him all his life.
     The needy groom, that never finger'd groat,
     Would make a miracle of thus much coin;
     But he whose steel-barr'd coffers are cramm'd full,
     And all his life-time hath been tired,
     Wearying his fingers' ends with telling it,
     Would in his age be loath to labour so,
     And for a pound to sweat himself to death.
     Give me the merchants of the Indian mines,
     That trade in metal of the purest mould;
     The wealthy Moor, that in the eastern rocks
     Without control can pick his riches up,
     And in his house heap pearl like pebble-stones,
     Receive them free, and sell them by the weight;
     Bags of fiery opals, sapphires, amethysts,
     Jacinths, hard topaz, grass-green emeralds,
     Beauteous rubies, sparkling diamonds,
     And seld-seen [20] costly stones of so great price,
     As one of them, indifferently rated,
     And of a carat of this quantity,
     May serve, in peril of calamity,
     To ransom great kings from captivity.
     This is the ware wherein consists my wealth;
     And thus methinks should men of judgment frame
     Their means of traffic from the vulgar trade,
     And, as their wealth increaseth, so inclose
     Infinite riches in a little room.
     But now how stands the wind?
     Into what corner peers my halcyon's bill? [21]
     Ha! to the east? yes.  See how stand the vanes--
     East and by south:  why, then, I hope my ships
     I sent for Egypt and the bordering isles
     Are gotten up by Nilus' winding banks;
     Mine argosy from Alexandria,
     Loaden with spice and silks, now under sail,
     Are smoothly gliding down by Candy-shore
     To Malta, through our Mediterranean sea.--
     But who comes here?

          Enter a MERCHANT.

                         How now!

     MERCHANT. Barabas, thy ships are safe,
     Riding in Malta-road; and all the merchants
     With other merchandise are safe arriv'd,
     And have sent me to know whether yourself
     Will come and custom them. [22]

     BARABAS. The ships are safe thou say'st, and richly fraught?

     MERCHANT. They are.

     BARABAS. Why, then, go bid them come ashore,
     And bring with them their bills of entry:
     I hope our credit in the custom-house
     Will serve as well as I were present there.
     Go send 'em threescore camels, thirty mules,
     And twenty waggons, to bring up the ware.
     But art thou master in a ship of mine,
     And is thy credit not enough for that?

     MERCHANT. The very custom barely comes to more
     Than many merchants of the town are worth,
     And therefore far exceeds my credit, sir.

     BARABAS. Go tell 'em the Jew of Malta sent thee, man:
     Tush, who amongst 'em knows not Barabas?

     MERCHANT. I go.

     BARABAS. So, then, there's somewhat come.--
     Sirrah, which of my ships art thou master of?

     MERCHANT. Of the Speranza, sir.

     BARABAS. And saw'st thou not
     Mine argosy at Alexandria?
     Thou couldst not come from Egypt, or by Caire,
     But at the entry there into the sea,
     Where Nilus pays his tribute to the main,
     Thou needs must sail by Alexandria.

     MERCHANT. I neither saw them, nor inquir'd of them:
     But this we heard some of our seamen say,
     They wonder'd how you durst with so much wealth
     Trust such a crazed vessel, and so far.

     BARABAS. Tush, they are wise!  I know her and her strength.
     But [23] go, go thou thy ways, discharge thy ship,
     And bid my factor bring his loading in.
          [Exit MERCHANT.]
     And yet I wonder at this argosy.

          Enter a Second MERCHANT.

     SECOND MERCHANT. Thine argosy from Alexandria,
     Know, Barabas, doth ride in Malta-road,
     Laden with riches, and exceeding store
     Of Persian silks, of gold, and orient pearl.

     BARABAS. How chance you came not with those other ships
     That sail'd by Egypt?

     SECOND MERCHANT. Sir, we saw 'em not.

     BARABAS. Belike they coasted round by Candy-shore
     About their oils or other businesses.
     But 'twas ill done of you to come so far
     Without the aid or conduct of their ships.

     SECOND MERCHANT. Sir, we were wafted by a Spanish fleet,
     That never left us till within a league,
     That had the galleys of the Turk in chase.

     BARABAS. O, they were going up to Sicily.
     Well, go,
     And bid the merchants and my men despatch,
     And come ashore, and see the fraught [24] discharg'd.

     SECOND MERCHANT. I go.
          [Exit.]

     BARABAS. Thus trolls our fortune in by land and sea,
     And thus are we on every side enrich'd:
     These are the blessings promis'd to the Jews,
     And herein was old Abraham's happiness:
     What more may heaven do for earthly man
     Than thus to pour out plenty in their laps,
     Ripping the bowels of the earth for them,
     Making the sea[s] their servants, and the winds
     To drive their substance with successful blasts?
     Who hateth me but for my happiness?
     Or who is honour'd now but for his wealth?
     Rather had I, a Jew, be hated thus,
     Than pitied in a Christian poverty;
     For I can see no fruits in all their faith,
     But malice, falsehood, and excessive pride,
     Which methinks fits not their profession.
     Haply some hapless man hath conscience,
     And for his conscience lives in beggary.
     They say we are a scatter'd nation:
     I cannot tell; but we have scambled [25] up
     More wealth by far than those that brag of faith:
     There's Kirriah Jairim, the great Jew of Greece,
     Obed in Bairseth, Nones in Portugal,
     Myself in Malta, some in Italy,
     Many in France, and wealthy every one;
     Ay, wealthier far than any Christian.
     I must confess we come not to be kings:
     That's not our fault:  alas, our number's few!
     And crowns come either by succession,
     Or urg'd by force; and nothing violent,
     Oft have I heard tell, can be permanent.
     Give us a peaceful rule; make Christians kings,
     That thirst so much for principality.
     I have no charge, nor many children,
     But one sole daughter, whom I hold as dear
     As Agamemnon did his Iphigen;
     And all I have is hers.--But who comes here?

          Enter three JEWS. [26]

     FIRST JEW. Tush, tell not me; 'twas done of policy.

     SECOND JEW. Come, therefore, let us go to Barabas;
     For he can counsel best in these affairs:
     And here he comes.

     BARABAS. Why, how now, countrymen!
     Why flock you thus to me in multitudes?
     What accident's betided to the Jews?

     FIRST JEW. A fleet of warlike galleys, Barabas,
     Are come from Turkey, and lie in our road:
     And they this day sit in the council-house
     To entertain them and their embassy.

     BARABAS. Why, let 'em come, so they come not to war;
     Or let 'em war, so we be conquerors.--
     Nay, let 'em combat, conquer, and kill all,
     So they spare me, my daughter, and my wealth.
          [Aside.]

     FIRST JEW. Were it for confirmation of a league,
     They would not come in warlike manner thus.

     SECOND JEW. I fear their coming will afflict us all.

     BARABAS. Fond [27] men, what dream you of their multitudes?
     What need they treat of peace that are in league?
     The Turks and those of Malta are in league:
     Tut, tut, there is some other matter in't.

     FIRST JEW. Why, Barabas, they come for peace or war.

     BARABAS. Haply for neither, but to pass along,
     Towards Venice, by the Adriatic sea,
     With whom they have attempted many times,
     But never could effect their stratagem.

     THIRD JEW. And very wisely said; it may be so.

     SECOND JEW. But there's a meeting in the senate-house,
     And all the Jews in Malta must be there.

     BARABAS. Hum,--all the Jews in Malta must be there!
     Ay, like enough:  why, then, let every man
     Provide him, and be there for fashion-sake.
     If any thing shall there concern our state,
     Assure yourselves I'll look--unto myself.
          [Aside.] [28]

     FIRST JEW. I know you will.--Well, brethren, let us go.

     SECOND JEW. Let's take our leaves.--Farewell, good Barabas.

     BARABAS. [29] Farewell, Zaareth; farewell, Temainte.
          [Exeunt JEWS.]
     And, Barabas, now search this secret out;
     Summon thy senses, call thy wits together:
     These silly men mistake the matter clean.
     Long to the Turk did Malta contribute;
     Which tribute all in policy, I fear,
     The Turk has [30] let increase to such a sum
     As all the wealth of Malta cannot pay;
     And now by that advantage thinks, belike,
     To seize upon the town; ay, that he seeks.
     Howe'er the world go, I'll make sure for one,
     And seek in time to intercept the worst,
     Warily guarding that which I ha' got:
     Ego mihimet sum semper proximus: [31]
     Why, let 'em enter, let 'em take the town.
          [Exit.] [32]

          Enter FERNEZE governor of Malta, KNIGHTS, and OFFICERS;
          met by CALYMATH, and BASSOES of the TURK.

     FERNEZE. Now, bassoes, [33] what demand you at our hands?

     FIRST BASSO. Know, knights of Malta, that we came from Rhodes,
     ]From Cyprus, Candy, and those other isles
     That lie betwixt the Mediterranean seas.

     FERNEZE. What's Cyprus, Candy, and those other isles
     To us or Malta? what at our hands demand ye?

     CALYMATH. The ten years' tribute that remains unpaid.

     FERNEZE. Alas, my lord, the sum is over-great!
     I hope your highness will consider us.

     CALYMATH. I wish, grave governor, [34] 'twere in my power
     To favour you; but 'tis my father's cause,
     Wherein I may not, nay, I dare not dally.

     FERNEZE. Then give us leave, great Selim Calymath.

     CALYMATH. Stand all aside, [35] and let the knights determine;
     And send to keep our galleys under sail,
     For happily [36] we shall not tarry here.--
     Now, governor, how are you resolv'd?

     FERNEZE. Thus; since your hard conditions are such
     That you will needs have ten years' tribute past,
     We may have time to make collection
     Amongst the inhabitants of Malta for't.

     FIRST BASSO. That's more than is in our commission.

     CALYMATH. What, Callapine! a little courtesy:
     Let's know their time; perhaps it is not long;
     And 'tis more kingly to obtain by peace
     Than to enforce conditions by constraint.--
     What respite ask you, governor?

     FERNEZE. But a month.

     CALYMATH. We grant a month; but see you keep your promise.
     Now launch our galleys back again to sea,
     Where we'll attend the respite you have ta'en,
     And for the money send our messenger.
     Farewell, great governor, and brave knights of Malta.

     FERNEZE. And all good fortune wait on Calymath!
          [Exeunt CALYMATH and BASSOES.]
     Go one and call those Jews of Malta hither:
     Were they not summon'd to appear to-day?

     FIRST OFFICER. They were, my lord; and here they come.

          Enter BARABAS and three JEWS.

     FIRST KNIGHT. Have you determin'd what to say to them?

     FERNEZE. Yes; give me leave:--and, Hebrews, now come near.
     ]From the Emperor of Turkey is arriv'd
     Great Selim Calymath, his highness' son,
     To levy of us ten years' tribute past:
     Now, then, here know that it concerneth us.

     BARABAS. Then, good my lord, to keep your quiet still,
     Your lordship shall do well to let them have it.

     FERNEZE. Soft, Barabas! there's more 'longs to't than so.
     To what this ten years' tribute will amount,
     That we have cast, but cannot compass it
     By reason of the wars, that robb'd our store;
     And therefore are we to request your aid.

     BARABAS. Alas, my lord, we are no soldiers!
     And what's our aid against so great a prince?

     FIRST KNIGHT. Tut, Jew, we know thou art no soldier:
     Thou art a merchant and a money'd man,
     And 'tis thy money, Barabas, we seek.

     BARABAS. How, my lord! my money!

     FERNEZE. Thine and the rest;
     For, to be short, amongst you't must be had.

     FIRST JEW. Alas, my lord, the most of us are poor!

     FERNEZE. Then let the rich increase your portions.

     BARABAS. Are strangers with your tribute to be tax'd?

     SECOND KNIGHT. Have strangers leave with us to get their wealth?
     Then let them with us contribute.

     BARABAS. How! equally?

     FERNEZE. No, Jew, like infidels;
     For through our sufferance of your hateful lives,
     Who stand accursed in the sight of heaven,
     These taxes and afflictions are befall'n,
     And therefore thus we are determined.--
     Read there the articles of our decrees.

     OFFICER. [37] [reads] FIRST, THE TRIBUTE-MONEY OF THE TURKS
     SHALL ALL BE LEVIED AMONGST THE JEWS, AND EACH OF THEM TO PAY
     ONE HALF OF HIS ESTATE.

     BARABAS. How! half his estate!--I hope you mean not mine.
          [Aside.]

     FERNEZE. Read on.

     OFFICER. [reads] SECONDLY, HE THAT DENIES [38] TO PAY, SHALL
     STRAIGHT-BECOME A CHRISTIAN.

     BARABAS. How! a Christian!--Hum,--what's here to do?
          [Aside.]

     OFFICER. [reads] LASTLY, HE THAT DENIES THIS, SHALL ABSOLUTELY
     LOSE ALL HE HAS.

     THREE JEWS. O my lord, we will give half!

     BARABAS. O earth-mettled villains, and no Hebrews born!
     And will you basely thus submit yourselves
     To leave your goods to their arbitrement?

     FERNEZE. Why, Barabas, wilt thou be christened?

     BARABAS. No, governor, I will be no convertite. [39]

     FERNEZE. Then pay thy half.

     BARABAS. Why, know you what you did by this device?
     Half of my substance is a city's wealth.
     Governor, it was not got so easily;
     Nor will I part so slightly therewithal.

     FERNEZE. Sir, half is the penalty of our decree;
     Either pay that, or we will seize on all.

     BARABAS. Corpo di Dio! stay:  you shall have half;
     Let me be us'd but as my brethren are.

     FERNEZE. No, Jew, thou hast denied the articles,
     And now it cannot be recall'd.
          [Exeunt OFFICERS, on a sign from FERNEZE]

     BARABAS. Will you, then, steal my goods?
     Is theft the ground of your religion?

     FERNEZE. No, Jew; we take particularly thine,
     To save the ruin of a multitude:
     And better one want for a common good,
     Than many perish for a private man:
     Yet, Barabas, we will not banish thee,
     But here in Malta, where thou gott'st thy wealth,
     Live still; and, if thou canst, get more.

     BARABAS. Christians, what or how can I multiply?
     Of naught is nothing made.

     FIRST KNIGHT. From naught at first thou cam'st to little wealth,
     ]From little unto more, from more to most:
     If your first curse fall heavy on thy head,
     And make thee poor and scorn'd of all the world,
     'Tis not our fault, but thy inherent sin.

     BARABAS. What, bring you Scripture to confirm your wrongs?
     Preach me not out of my possessions.
     Some Jews are wicked, as all Christians are:
     But say the tribe that I descended of
     Were all in general cast away for sin,
     Shall I be tried by their transgression?
     The man that dealeth righteously shall live;
     And which of you can charge me otherwise?

     FERNEZE. Out, wretched Barabas!
     Sham'st thou not thus to justify thyself,
     As if we knew not thy profession?
     If thou rely upon thy righteousness,
     Be patient, and thy riches will increase.
     Excess of wealth is cause of covetousness;
     And covetousness, O, 'tis a monstrous sin!

     BARABAS. Ay, but theft is worse:  tush! take not from me, then,
     For that is theft; and, if you rob me thus,
     I must be forc'd to steal, and compass more.

     FIRST KNIGHT. Grave governor, list not to his exclaims:
     Convert his mansion to a nunnery;
     His house will harbour many holy nuns.

     FERNEZE. It shall be so.

          Re-enter OFFICERS.

                         Now, officers, have you done?

     FIRST OFFICER. Ay, my lord, we have seiz'd upon the goods
     And wares of Barabas, which, being valu'd,
     Amount to more than all the wealth in Malta:
     And of the other we have seized half.

     FERNEZE. Then we'll take [40] order for the residue.

     BARABAS. Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?
     You have my goods, my money, and my wealth,
     My ships, my store, and all that I enjoy'd;
     And, having all, you can request no more,
     Unless your unrelenting flinty hearts
     Suppress all pity in your stony breasts,
     And now shall move you to bereave my life.

     FERNEZE. No, Barabas; to stain our hands with blood
     Is far from us and our profession.

     BARABAS.  Why, I esteem the injury far less,
     To take the lives of miserable men
     Than be the causers of their misery.
     You have my wealth, the labour of my life,
     The comfort of mine age, my children's hope;
     And therefore ne'er distinguish of the wrong.

     FERNEZE. Content thee, Barabas; thou hast naught but right.

     BARABAS. Your extreme right does me exceeding wrong:
     But take it to you, i'the devil's name!

     FERNEZE. Come, let us in, and gather of these goods
     The money for this tribute of the Turk.

     FIRST KNIGHT. 'Tis necessary that be look'd unto;
     For, if we break our day, we break the league,
     And that will prove but simple policy.
          [Exeunt all except BARABAS and the three JEWS.]

     BARABAS. Ay, policy! that's their profession,
     And not simplicity, as they suggest.--
     The plagues of Egypt, and the curse of heaven,
     Earth's barrenness, and all men's hatred,
     Inflict upon them, thou great Primus Motor!
     And here upon my knees, striking the earth,
     I ban their souls to everlasting pains,
     And extreme tortures of the fiery deep,
     That thus have dealt with me in my distress!

     FIRST JEW. O, yet be patient, gentle Barabas!

     BARABAS. O silly brethren, born to see this day,
     Why stand you thus unmov'd with my laments?
     Why weep you not to think upon my wrongs?
     Why pine not I, and die in this distress?

     FIRST JEW. Why, Barabas, as hardly can we brook
     The cruel handling of ourselves in this:
     Thou seest they have taken half our goods.

     BARABAS. Why did you yield to their extortion?
     You were a multitude, and I but one;
     And of me only have they taken all.

     FIRST JEW. Yet, brother Barabas, remember Job.

     BARABAS. What tell you me of Job? I wot his wealth
     Was written thus; he had seven thousand sheep,
     Three thousand camels, and two hundred yoke
     Of labouring oxen, and five hundred
     She-asses:  but for every one of those,
     Had they been valu'd at indifferent rate,
     I had at home, and in mine argosy,
     And other ships that came from Egypt last,
     As much as would have bought his beasts and him,
     And yet have kept enough to live upon;
     So that not he, but I, may curse the day,
     Thy fatal birth-day, forlorn Barabas;
     And henceforth wish for an eternal night,
     That clouds of darkness may inclose my flesh,
     And hide these extreme sorrows from mine eyes;
     For only I have toil'd to inherit here
     The months of vanity, and loss of time,
     And painful nights, have been appointed me.

     SECOND JEW. Good Barabas, be patient.

     BARABAS. Ay, I pray, leave me in my patience.  You, that
     Were ne'er possess'd of wealth, are pleas'd with want;
     But give him liberty at least to mourn,
     That in a field, amidst his enemies,
     Doth see his soldiers slain, himself disarm'd,
     And knows no means of his recovery:
     Ay, let me sorrow for this sudden chance;
     'Tis in the trouble of my spirit I speak:
     Great injuries are not so soon forgot.

     FIRST JEW. Come, let us leave him; in his ireful mood
     Our words will but increase his ecstasy. [41]

     SECOND JEW. On, then:  but, trust me, 'tis a misery
     To see a man in such affliction.--
     Farewell, Barabas.

     BARABAS. Ay, fare you well.
          [Exeunt three JEWS.] [42]
     See the simplicity of these base slaves,
     Who, for the villains have no wit themselves,
     Think me to be a senseless lump of clay,
     That will with every water wash to dirt!
     No, Barabas is born to better chance,
     And fram'd of finer mould than common men,
     That measure naught but by the present time.
     A reaching thought will search his deepest wits,
     And cast with cunning for the time to come;
     For evils are apt to happen every day.

          Enter ABIGAIL.

     But whither wends my beauteous Abigail?
     O, what has made my lovely daughter sad?
     What, woman! moan not for a little loss;
     Thy father has enough in store for thee.

     ABIGAIL. Nor for myself, but aged Barabas,
     Father, for thee lamenteth Abigail:
     But I will learn to leave these fruitless tears;
     And, urg'd thereto with my afflictions,
     With fierce exclaims run to the senate-house,
     And in the senate reprehend them all,
     And rent their hearts with tearing of my hair,
     Till they reduce [43] the wrongs done to my father.

     BARABAS. No, Abigail; things past recovery
     Are hardly cur'd with exclamations:
     Be silent, daughter; sufferance breeds ease,
     And time may yield us an occasion,
     Which on the sudden cannot serve the turn.
     Besides, my girl, think me not all so fond [44]
     As negligently to forgo so much
     Without provision for thyself and me:
     Ten thousand portagues, [45] besides great pearls,
     Rich costly jewels, and stones infinite,
     Fearing the worst of this before it fell,
     I closely hid.

     ABIGAIL. Where, father?

     BARABAS. In my house, my girl.

     ABIGAIL. Then shall they ne'er be seen of Barabas;
     For they have seiz'd upon thy house and wares.

     BARABAS. But they will give me leave once more, I trow,
     To go into my house.

     ABIGAIL. That may they not;
     For there I left the governor placing nuns,
     Displacing me; and of thy house they mean
     To make a nunnery, where none but their own sect [46]
     Must enter in; men generally barr'd.

     BARABAS. My gold, my gold, and all my wealth is gone!--
     You partial heavens, have I deserv'd this plague?
     What, will you thus oppose me, luckless stars,
     To make me desperate in my poverty?
     And, knowing me impatient in distress,
     Think me so mad as I will hang myself,
     That I may vanish o'er the earth in air,
     And leave no memory that e'er I was?
     No, I will live; nor loathe I this my life:
     And, since you leave me in the ocean thus
     To sink or swim, and put me to my shifts,
     I'll rouse my senses, and awake myself.--
     Daughter, I have it:  thou perceiv'st the plight
     Wherein these Christians have oppressed me:
     Be rul'd by me, for in extremity
     We ought to make bar of no policy.

     ABIGAIL. Father, whate'er it be, to injure them
     That have so manifestly wronged us,
     What will not Abigail attempt?

     BARABAS. Why, so.
     Then thus:  thou told'st me they have turn'd my house
     Into a nunnery, and some nuns are there?

     ABIGAIL. I did.

     BARABAS. Then, Abigail, there must my girl
     Entreat the abbess to be entertain'd.

     ABIGAIL. How! as a nun?

     BARABAS. Ay, daughter; for religion
     Hides many mischiefs from suspicion.

     ABIGAIL. Ay, but, father, they will suspect me there.

     BARABAS. Let 'em suspect; but be thou so precise
     As they may think it done of holiness:
     Entreat 'em fair, and give them friendly speech,
     And seem to them as if thy sins were great,
     Till thou hast gotten to be entertain'd.

     ABIGAIL. Thus, father, shall I much dissemble.

     BARABAS. Tush!
     As good dissemble that thou never mean'st,
     As first mean truth and then dissemble it:
     A counterfeit profession is better
     Than unseen hypocrisy.

     ABIGAIL. Well, father, say I be entertain'd,
     What then shall follow?

     BARABAS. This shall follow then.
     There have I hid, close underneath the plank
     That runs along the upper-chamber floor,
     The gold and jewels which I kept for thee:--
     But here they come:  be cunning, Abigail.

     ABIGAIL. Then, father, go with me.

     BARABAS. No, Abigail, in this
     It is not necessary I be seen;
     For I will seem offended with thee for't:
     Be close, my girl, for this must fetch my gold.
          [They retire.]

          Enter FRIAR JACOMO, [47] FRIAR BARNARDINE, ABBESS, and a NUN.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Sisters,
     We now are almost at the new-made nunnery.

     ABBESS. [48] The better; for we love not to be seen:
     'Tis thirty winters long since some of us
     Did stray so far amongst the multitude.

     FRIAR JACOMO. But, madam, this house
     And waters of this new-made nunnery
     Will much delight you.

     ABBESS. It may be so.--But who comes here?

          [ABIGAIL comes forward.]

     ABIGAIL. Grave abbess, and you happy virgins' guide,
     Pity the state of a distressed maid!

     ABBESS. What art thou, daughter?

     ABIGAIL. The hopeless daughter of a hapless Jew,
     The Jew of Malta, wretched Barabas,
     Sometimes [49] the owner of a goodly house,
     Which they have now turn'd to a nunnery.

     ABBESS. Well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us?

     ABIGAIL. Fearing the afflictions which my father feels
     Proceed from sin or want of faith in us,
     I'd pass away my life in penitence,
     And be a novice in your nunnery,
     To make atonement for my labouring soul.

     FRIAR JACOMO. No doubt, brother, but this proceedeth of
     the spirit.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE.
     Ay, and of a moving spirit too, brother:  but come,
     Let us entreat she may be entertain'd.

     ABBESS. Well, daughter, we admit you for a nun.

     ABIGAIL. First let me as a novice learn to frame
     My solitary life to your strait laws,
     And let me lodge where I was wont to lie:
     I do not doubt, by your divine precepts
     And mine own industry, but to profit much.

     BARABAS. As much, I hope, as all I hid is worth.
          [Aside.]

     ABBESS. Come, daughter, follow us.

     BARABAS. [coming forward] Why, how now, Abigail!
     What mak'st thou 'mongst these hateful Christians?

     FRIAR JACOMO. Hinder her not, thou man of little faith,
     For she has mortified herself.

     BARABAS. How! mortified!

     FRIAR JACOMO. And is admitted to the sisterhood.

     BARABAS. Child of perdition, and thy father's shame!
     What wilt thou do among these hateful fiends?
     I charge thee on my blessing that thou leave
     These devils and their damned heresy!

     ABIGAIL. Father, forgive me-- [50]

     BARABAS. Nay, back, Abigail,
     And think upon the jewels and the gold;
     The board is marked thus that covers it.--
          [Aside to ABIGAIL in a whisper.]
     Away, accursed, from thy father's sight!

     FRIAR JACOMO. Barabas, although thou art in misbelief,
     And wilt not see thine own afflictions,
     Yet let thy daughter be no longer blind.

     BARABAS. Blind friar, I reck not thy persuasions,--
     The board is marked thus [51] that covers it--
          [Aside to ABIGAIL in a whisper.]
     For I had rather die than see her thus.--
     Wilt thou forsake me too in my distress,
     Seduced daughter?--Go, forget not.-- [52]
          [Aside to her in a whisper.]
     Becomes it Jews to be so credulous?--
     To-morrow early I'll be at the door.--
          [Aside to her in a whisper.]
     No, come not at me; if thou wilt be damn'd,
     Forget me, see me not; and so, be gone!--
     Farewell; remember to-morrow morning.--
          [Aside to her in a whisper.]
     Out, out, thou wretch!
          [Exit, on one side, BARABAS.  Exeunt, on the other side,
          FRIARS, ABBESS, NUN, and ABIGAIL:  and, as they are going
          out,]

          Enter MATHIAS.

     MATHIAS. Who's this? fair Abigail, the rich Jew's daughter,
     Become a nun! her father's sudden fall
     Has humbled her, and brought her down to this:
     Tut, she were fitter for a tale of love,
     Than to be tired out with orisons;
     And better would she far become a bed,
     Embraced in a friendly lover's arms,
     Than rise at midnight to a solemn mass.

          Enter LODOWICK.

     LODOWICK. Why, how now, Don Mathias! in a dump?

     MATHIAS. Believe me, noble Lodowick, I have seen
     The strangest sight, in my opinion,
     That ever I beheld.

     LODOWICK. What was't, I prithee?

     MATHIAS. A fair young maid, scarce fourteen years of age,
     The sweetest flower in Cytherea's field,
     Cropt from the pleasures of the fruitful earth,
     And strangely metamorphos'd [to a] nun.

     LODOWICK. But say, what was she?

     MATHIAS. Why, the rich Jew's daughter.

     LODOWICK. What, Barabas, whose goods were lately seiz'd?
     Is she so fair?

     MATHIAS. And matchless beautiful,
     As, had you seen her, 'twould have mov'd your heart,
     Though countermin'd with walls of brass, to love,
     Or, at the least, to pity.

     LODOWICK. An if she be so fair as you report,
     'Twere time well spent to go and visit her:
     How say you? shall we?

     MATHIAS. I must and will, sir; there's no remedy.

     LODOWICK. And so will I too, or it shall go hard.
     Farewell, Mathias.

     MATHIAS. Farewell, Lodowick.
          [Exeunt severally.]




ACT II.

          Enter BARABAS, with a light. [53]

     BARABAS. Thus, like the sad-presaging raven, that tolls
     The sick man's passport in her hollow beak, [54]
     And in the shadow of the silent night
     Doth shake contagion from her sable wings,
     Vex'd and tormented runs poor Barabas
     With fatal curses towards these Christians.
     The incertain pleasures of swift-footed time
     Have ta'en their flight, and left me in despair;
     And of my former riches rests no more
     But bare remembrance; like a soldier's scar,
     That has no further comfort for his maim.--
     O Thou, that with a fiery pillar ledd'st
     The sons of Israel through the dismal shades,
     Light Abraham's offspring; and direct the hand
     Of Abigail this night! or let the day
     Turn to eternal darkness after this!--
     No sleep can fasten on my watchful eyes,
     Nor quiet enter my distemper'd thoughts,
     Till I have answer of my Abigail.

          Enter ABIGAIL above.

     ABIGAIL. Now have I happily espied a time
     To search the plank my father did appoint;
     And here, behold, unseen, where I have found
     The gold, the pearls, and jewels, which he hid.

     BARABAS. Now I remember those old women's words,
     Who in my wealth would tell me winter's tales,
     And speak of spirits and ghosts that glide by night
     About the place where treasure hath been hid:
     And now methinks that I am one of those;
     For, whilst I live, here lives my soul's sole hope,
     And, when I die, here shall my spirit walk.

     ABIGAIL. Now that my father's fortune were so good
     As but to be about this happy place!
     'Tis not so happy:  yet, when we parted last,
     He said he would attend me in the morn.
     Then, gentle Sleep, where'er his body rests,
     Give charge to Morpheus that he may dream
     A golden dream, and of [55] the sudden wake, [56]
     Come and receive the treasure I have found.

     BARABAS. Bueno para todos mi ganado no era: [57]
     As good go on, as sit so sadly thus.--
     But stay:  what star shines yonder in the east? [58]
     The loadstar of my life, if Abigail.--
     Who's there?

     ABIGAIL. Who's that?

     BARABAS. Peace, Abigail! 'tis I.

     ABIGAIL. Then, father, here receive thy happiness.

     BARABAS. Hast thou't?

     ABIGAIL. Here.[throws down bags]  Hast thou't?
     There's more, and more, and more.

     BARABAS. O my girl,
     My gold, my fortune, my felicity,
     Strength to my soul, death to mine enemy;
     Welcome the first beginner of my bliss!
     O Abigail, Abigail, that I had thee here too!
     Then my desires were fully satisfied:
     But I will practice thy enlargement thence:
     O girl! O gold! O beauty! O my bliss!
          [Hugs the bags.]

     ABIGAIL. Father, it draweth towards midnight now,
     And 'bout this time the nuns begin to wake;
     To shun suspicion, therefore, let us part.

     BARABAS. Farewell, my joy, and by my fingers take
     A kiss from him that sends it from his soul.
          [Exit ABIGAIL above.]
     Now, Phoebus, ope the eye-lids of the day.
     And, for the raven, wake the morning lark,
     That I may hover with her in the air,
     Singing o'er these, as she does o'er her young.
     Hermoso placer de los dineros. [59]
          [Exit.]

          Enter FERNEZE, [60] MARTIN DEL BOSCO, KNIGHTS, and OFFICERS.

     FERNEZE. Now, captain, tell us whither thou art bound?
     Whence is thy ship that anchors in our road?
     And why thou cam'st ashore without our leave?

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. Governor of Malta, hither am I bound;
     My ship, the Flying Dragon, is of Spain,
     And so am I; Del Bosco is my name,
     Vice-admiral unto the Catholic King.

     FIRST KNIGHT. 'Tis true, my lord; therefore entreat [61] him well.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO.
     Our fraught is Grecians, Turks, and Afric Moors;
     For late upon the coast of Corsica,
     Because we vail'd not [62] to the Turkish [63] fleet,
     Their creeping galleys had us in the chase:
     But suddenly the wind began to rise,
     And then we luff'd and tack'd, [64] and fought at ease:
     Some have we fir'd, and many have we sunk;
     But one amongst the rest became our prize:
     The captain's slain; the rest remain our slaves,
     Of whom we would make sale in Malta here.

     FERNEZE. Martin del Bosco, I have heard of thee:
     Welcome to Malta, and to all of us!
     But to admit a sale of these thy Turks,
     We may not, nay, we dare not give consent,
     By reason of a tributary league.

     FIRST KNIGHT. Del Bosco, as thou lov'st and honour'st us,
     Persuade our governor against the Turk:
     This truce we have is but in hope of gold,
     And with that sum he craves might we wage war.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. Will knights of Malta be in league with Turks,
     And buy it basely too for sums of gold?
     My lord, remember that, to Europe's shame,
     The Christian isle of Rhodes, from whence you came,
     Was lately lost, and you were stated [65] here
     To be at deadly enmity with Turks.

     FERNEZE. Captain, we know it; but our force is small.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. What is the sum that Calymath requires?

     FERNEZE. A hundred thousand crowns.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. My lord and king hath title to this isle,
     And he means quickly to expel you hence;
     Therefore be rul'd by me, and keep the gold:
     I'll write unto his majesty for aid,
     And not depart until I see you free.

     FERNEZE. On this condition shall thy Turks be sold.--
     Go, officers, and set them straight in show.--
          [Exeunt OFFICERS.]
     Bosco, thou shalt be Malta's general;
     We and our warlike knights will follow thee
     Against these barbarous misbelieving Turks.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. So shall you imitate those you succeed;
     For, when their hideous force environ'd Rhodes,
     Small though the number was that kept the town,
     They fought it out, and not a man surviv'd
     To bring the hapless news to Christendom.

     FERNEZE. So will we fight it out:  come, let's away.
     Proud daring Calymath, instead of gold,
     We'll send thee bullets wrapt in smoke and fire:
     Claim tribute where thou wilt, we are resolv'd,--
     Honour is bought with blood, and not with gold.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter OFFICERS, [66] with ITHAMORE and other SLAVES.

     FIRST OFFICER. This is the market-place; here let 'em stand:
     Fear not their sale, for they'll be quickly bought.

     SECOND OFFICER. Every one's price is written on his back,
     And so much must they yield, or not be sold.

     FIRST OFFICER.
     Here comes the Jew:  had not his goods been seiz'd,
     He'd give us present money for them all.

          Enter BARABAS.

     BARABAS. In spite of these swine-eating Christians,
     (Unchosen nation, never circumcis'd,
     Poor villains, such as were [67] ne'er thought upon
     Till Titus and Vespasian conquer'd us,)
     Am I become as wealthy as I was.
     They hop'd my daughter would ha' been a nun;
     But she's at home, and I have bought a house
     As great and fair as is the governor's:
     And there, in spite of Malta, will I dwell,
     Having Ferneze's hand; whose heart I'll have,
     Ay, and his son's too, or it shall go hard.
     I am not of the tribe of Levi, I,
     That can so soon forget an injury.
     We Jews can fawn like spaniels when we please;
     And when we grin we bite; yet are our looks
     As innocent and harmless as a lamb's.
     I learn'd in Florence how to kiss my hand,
     Heave up my shoulders when they call me dog,
     And duck as low as any bare-foot friar;
     Hoping to see them starve upon a stall,
     Or else be gather'd for in our synagogue,
     That, when the offering-basin comes to me,
     Even for charity I may spit into't.--
     Here comes Don Lodowick, the governor's son,
     One that I love for his good father's sake.

          Enter LODOWICK.

     LODOWICK. I hear the wealthy Jew walked this way:
     I'll seek him out, and so insinuate,
     That I may have a sight of Abigail,
     For Don Mathias tells me she is fair.

     BARABAS. Now will I shew myself to have more of the serpent than
     the dove; that is, more knave than fool.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. Yond' walks the Jew:  now for fair Abigail.

     BARABAS. Ay, ay, no doubt but she's at your command.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. Barabas, thou know'st I am the governor's son.

     BARABAS.
     I would you were his father too, sir! that's all the harm
     I wish you.--The slave looks like a hog's cheek new-singed.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. Whither walk'st thou, Barabas?

     BARABAS. No further:  'tis a custom held with us,
     That when we speak with Gentiles like to you,
     We turn into [68] the air to purge ourselves;
     For unto us the promise doth belong.

     LODOWICK. Well, Barabas, canst help me to a diamond?

     BARABAS. O, sir, your father had my diamonds:
     Yet I have one left that will serve your turn.--
     I mean my daughter; but, ere he shall have her,
     I'll sacrifice her on a pile of wood:
     I ha' the poison of the city [69] for him,
     And the white leprosy.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. What sparkle does it give without a foil?

     BARABAS. The diamond that I talk of ne'er was foil'd:--
     But, when he touches it, it will be foil'd.-- [70]
          [Aside.]
     Lord Lodowick, it sparkles bright and fair.

     LODOWICK. Is it square or pointed? pray, let me know.

     BARABAS. Pointed it is, good sir,--but not for you.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. I like it much the better.

     BARABAS. So do I too.

     LODOWICK. How shews it by night?

     BARABAS. Outshines Cynthia's rays:--
     You'll like it better far o' nights than days.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. And what's the price?

     BARABAS. Your life, an if you have it [Aside].--O my lord,
     We will not jar about the price:  come to my house,
     And I will give't your honour--with a vengeance.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. No, Barabas, I will deserve it first.

     BARABAS. Good sir,
     Your father has deserv'd it at my hands,
     Who, of mere charity and Christian ruth,
     To bring me to religious purity,
     And, as it were, in catechising sort,
     To make me mindful of my mortal sins,
     Against my will, and whether I would or no,
     Seiz'd all I had, and thrust me out o' doors,
     And made my house a place for nuns most chaste.

     LODOWICK. No doubt your soul shall reap the fruit of it.

     BARABAS. Ay, but, my lord, the harvest is far off:
     And yet I know the prayers of those nuns
     And holy friars, having money for their pains,
     Are wondrous;--and indeed do no man good;--
          [Aside.]
     And, seeing they are not idle, but still doing,
     'Tis likely they in time may reap some fruit,
     I mean, in fullness of perfection.

     LODOWICK. Good Barabas, glance not at our holy nuns.

     BARABAS. No, but I do it through a burning zeal,--
     Hoping ere long to set the house a-fire;
     For, though they do a while increase and multiply,
     I'll have a saying to that nunnery.-- [71]
          [Aside.]
     As for the diamond, sir, I told you of,
     Come home, and there's no price shall make us part,
     Even for your honourable father's sake,--
     It shall go hard but I will see your death.--
          [Aside.]
     But now I must be gone to buy a slave.

     LODOWICK. And, Barabas, I'll bear thee company.

     BARABAS. Come, then; here's the market-place.--
     What's the price of this slave? two hundred crowns! do the Turks
     weigh so much?

     FIRST OFFICER. Sir, that's his price.

     BARABAS. What, can he steal, that you demand so much?
     Belike he has some new trick for a purse;
     An if he has, he is worth three hundred plates, [72]
     So that, being bought, the town-seal might be got
     To keep him for his life-time from the gallows:
     The sessions-day is critical to thieves,
     And few or none scape but by being purg'd.

     LODOWICK. Rat'st thou this Moor but at two hundred plates?

     FIRST OFFICER. No more, my lord.

     BARABAS. Why should this Turk be dearer than that Moor?

     FIRST OFFICER. Because he is young, and has more qualities.

     BARABAS. What, hast the philosopher's stone? an thou hast, break
     my head with it, I'll forgive thee.

     SLAVE. [73] No, sir; I can cut and shave.

     BARABAS. Let me see, sirrah; are you not an old shaver?

     SLAVE. Alas, sir, I am a very youth!

     BARABAS. A youth! I'll buy you, and marry you to Lady Vanity, [74]
     if you do well.

     SLAVE. I will serve you, sir.

     BARABAS. Some wicked trick or other:  it may be, under colour
     of shaving, thou'lt cut my throat for my goods.  Tell me,
     hast thou thy health well?

     SLAVE. Ay, passing well.

     BARABAS. So much the worse:  I must have one that's sickly, an't
     be but for sparing victuals:  'tis not a stone of beef a-day
     will maintain you in these chops.--Let me see one that's
     somewhat leaner.

     FIRST OFFICER. Here's a leaner; how like you him?

     BARABAS. Where wast thou born?

     ITHAMORE. In Thrace; brought up in Arabia.

     BARABAS. So much the better; thou art for my turn.
     An hundred crowns?  I'll have him; there's the coin.
          [Gives money.]

     FIRST OFFICER. Then mark him, sir, and take him hence.

     BARABAS. Ay, mark him, you were best; for this is he
     That by my help shall do much villany.--
          [Aside.]
     My lord, farewell.--Come, sirrah; you are mine.--
     As for the diamond, it shall be yours:
     I pray, sir, be no stranger at my house;
     All that I have shall be at your command.

          Enter MATHIAS and KATHARINE. [75]

     MATHIAS. What make the Jew and Lodowick so private?
     I fear me 'tis about fair Abigail.
          [Aside.]

     BARABAS. [to LODOWICK.] Yonder comes Don Mathias; let us stay: [76]
     He loves my daughter, and she holds him dear;
     But I have sworn to frustrate both their hopes,
     And be reveng'd upon the--governor.
          [Aside.]
          [Exit LODOWICK.]

     KATHARINE. This Moor is comeliest, is he not? speak, son.

     MATHIAS. No, this is the better, mother, view this well.

     BARABAS. Seem not to know me here before your mother,
     Lest she mistrust the match that is in hand:
     When you have brought her home, come to my house;
     Think of me as thy father:  son, farewell.

     MATHIAS. But wherefore talk'd Don Lodowick with you?

     BARABAS. Tush, man! we talk'd of diamonds, not of Abigail.

     KATHARINE. Tell me, Mathias, is not that the Jew?

     BARABAS. As for the comment on the Maccabees,
     I have it, sir, and 'tis at your command.

     MATHIAS. Yes, madam, and my talk with him was [77]
     About the borrowing of a book or two.

     KATHARINE. Converse not with him; he is cast off from heaven.--
     Thou hast thy crowns, fellow.--Come, let's away.

     MATHIAS. Sirrah Jew, remember the book.

     BARABAS. Marry, will I, sir.
          [Exeunt KATHARlNE and MATHIAS.]

     FIRST OFFICER. Come, I have made a reasonable market; let's away.
          [Exeunt OFFICERS with SLAVES.]

     BARABAS. Now let me know thy name, and therewithal
     Thy birth, condition, and profession.

     ITHAMORE. Faith, sir, my birth is but mean; my name's Ithamore;
     my profession what you please.

     BARABAS. Hast thou no trade? then listen to my words,
     And I will teach [thee] that shall stick by thee:
     First, be thou void of these affections,
     Compassion, love, vain hope, and heartless fear;
     Be mov'd at nothing, see thou pity none,
     But to thyself smile when the Christians moan.

     ITHAMORE. O, brave, master! [78] I worship your nose [79] for this.

     BARABAS. As for myself, I walk abroad o' nights,
     And kill sick people groaning under walls:
     Sometimes I go about and poison wells;
     And now and then, to cherish Christian thieves,
     I am content to lose some of my crowns,
     That I may, walking in my gallery,
     See 'em go pinion'd along by my door.
     Being young, I studied physic, and began
     To practice first upon the Italian;
     There I enrich'd the priests with burials,
     And always kept the sexton's arms in ure [80]
     With digging graves and ringing dead men's knells:
     And, after that, was I an engineer,
     And in the wars 'twixt France and Germany,
     Under pretence of helping Charles the Fifth,
     Slew friend and enemy with my stratagems:
     Then, after that, was I an usurer,
     And with extorting, cozening, forfeiting,
     And tricks belonging unto brokery,
     I fill'd the gaols with bankrupts in a year,
     And with young orphans planted hospitals;
     And every moon made some or other mad,
     And now and then one hang himself for grief,
     Pinning upon his breast a long great scroll
     How I with interest tormented him.
     But mark how I am blest for plaguing them;--
     I have as much coin as will buy the town.
     But tell me now, how hast thou spent thy time?

     ITHAMORE. Faith, master,
     In setting Christian villages on fire,
     Chaining of eunuchs, binding galley-slaves.
     One time I was an hostler in an inn,
     And in the night-time secretly would I steal
     To travellers' chambers, and there cut their throats:
     Once at Jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,
     I strewed powder on the marble stones,
     And therewithal their knees would rankle so,
     That I have laugh'd a-good [81] to see the cripples
     Go limping home to Christendom on stilts.

     BARABAS. Why, this is something:  make account of me
     As of thy fellow; we are villains both;
     Both circumcised; we hate Christians both:
     Be true and secret; thou shalt want no gold.
     But stand aside; here comes Don Lodowick.

          Enter LODOWICK. [82]

     LODOWICK. O, Barabas, well met;
     Where is the diamond you told me of?

     BARABAS. I have it for you, sir:  please you walk in with me.--
     What, ho, Abigail! open the door, I say!

          Enter ABIGAIL, with letters.

     ABIGAIL. In good time, father; here are letters come
     ]From Ormus, and the post stays here within.

     BARABAS. Give me the letters.--Daughter, do you hear?
     Entertain Lodowick, the governor's son,
     With all the courtesy you can afford,
     Provided that you keep your maidenhead:
     Use him as if he were a Philistine;
     Dissemble, swear, protest, vow love to him: [83]
     He is not of the seed of Abraham.--
          [Aside to her.]
     I am a little busy, sir; pray, pardon me.--
     Abigail, bid him welcome for my sake.

     ABIGAIL. For your sake and his own he's welcome hither.

     BARABAS. Daughter, a word more:  kiss him, speak him fair,
     And like a cunning Jew so cast about,
     That ye be both made sure [84] ere you come out.
          [Aside to her.]

     ABIGAIL. O father, Don Mathias is my love!

     BARABAS. I know it:  yet, I say, make love to him;
     Do, it is requisite it should be so.--
          [Aside to her.]
     Nay, on my life, it is my factor's hand;
     But go you in, I'll think upon the account.
          [Exeunt ABIGAIL and LODOWICK into the house.]
     The account is made, for Lodovico [85] dies.
     My factor sends me word a merchant's fled
     That owes me for a hundred tun of wine:
     I weigh it thus much[snapping his fingers]!  I have wealth enough;
     For now by this has he kiss'd Abigail,
     And she vows love to him, and he to her.
     As sure as heaven rain'd manna for the Jews,
     So sure shall he and Don Mathias die:
     His father was my chiefest enemy.

          Enter MATHIAS.

     Whither goes Don Mathias? stay a while.

     MATHIAS. Whither, but to my fair love Abigail?

     BARABAS. Thou know'st, and heaven can witness it is true,
     That I intend my daughter shall be thine.

     MATHIAS. Ay, Barabas, or else thou wrong'st me much.

     BARABAS. O, heaven forbid I should have such a thought!
     Pardon me though I weep:  the governor's son
     Will, whether I will or no, have Abigail;
     He sends her letters, bracelets, jewels, rings.

     MATHIAS. Does she receive them?

     BARABAS. She! no, Mathias, no, but sends them back;
     And, when he comes, she locks herself up fast;
     Yet through the key-hole will he talk to her,
     While she runs to the window, looking out
     When you should come and hale him from the door.

     MATHIAS. O treacherous Lodowick!

     BARABAS. Even now, as I came home, he slipt me in,
     And I am sure he is with Abigail.

     MATHIAS. I'll rouse him thence.

     BARABAS. Not for all Malta; therefore sheathe your sword;
     If you love me, no quarrels in my house;
     But steal you in, and seem to see him not:
     I'll give him such a warning ere he goes,
     As he shall have small hopes of Abigail.
     Away, for here they come.

          Re-enter LODOWICK and ABIGAIL.

     MATHIAS. What, hand in hand! I cannot suffer this.

     BARABAS. Mathias, as thou lov'st me, not a word.

     MATHIAS. Well, let it pass; another time shall serve.
          [Exit into the house.]

     LODOWICK. Barabas, is not that the widow's son?

     BARABAS. Ay, and take heed, for he hath sworn your death.

     LODOWICK. My death! what, is the base-born peasant mad?

     BARABAS. No, no; but happily [86] he stands in fear
     Of that which you, I think, ne'er dream upon,--
     My daughter here, a paltry silly girl.

     LODOWICK. Why, loves she Don Mathias?

     BARABAS. Doth she not with her smiling answer you?

     ABIGAIL. He has my heart; I smile against my will.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. Barabas, thou know'st I have lov'd thy daughter long.

     BARABAS. And so has she done you, even from a child.

     LODOWICK. And now I can no longer hold my mind.

     BARABAS. Nor I the affection that I bear to you.

     LODOWICK. This is thy diamond; tell me, shall I have it?

     BARABAS. Win it, and wear it; it is yet unsoil'd. [87]
     O, but I know your lordship would disdain
     To marry with the daughter of a Jew:
     And yet I'll give her many a golden cross [88]
     With Christian posies round about the ring.

     LODOWICK. 'Tis not thy wealth, but her that I esteem;
     Yet crave I thy consent.

     BARABAS. And mine you have; yet let me talk to her.--
     This offspring of Cain, this Jebusite,
     That never tasted of the Passover,
     Nor e'er shall see the land of Canaan,
     Nor our Messias that is yet to come;
     This gentle maggot, Lodowick, I mean,
     Must be deluded:  let him have thy hand,
     But keep thy heart till Don Mathias comes.
          [Aside to her.]

     ABIGAIL. What, shall I be betroth'd to Lodowick?

     BARABAS. It's no sin to deceive a Christian;
     For they themselves hold it a principle,
     Faith is not to be held with heretics:
     But all are heretics that are not Jews;
     This follows well, and therefore, daughter, fear not.--
          [Aside to her.]
     I have entreated her, and she will grant.

     LODOWICK. Then, gentle Abigail, plight thy faith to me.

     ABIGAIL. I cannot choose, seeing my father bids:
     Nothing but death shall part my love and me.

     LODOWICK. Now have I that for which my soul hath long'd.

     BARABAS. So have not I; but yet I hope I shall.
          [Aside.]

     ABIGAIL. O wretched Abigail, what hast thou [89] done?
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. Why on the sudden is your colour chang'd?

     ABIGAIL. I know not:  but farewell; I must be gone.

     BARABAS. Stay her, but let her not speak one word more.

     LODOWICK. Mute o' the sudden! here's a sudden change.

     BARABAS. O, muse not at it; 'tis the Hebrews' guise,
     That maidens new-betroth'd should weep a while:
     Trouble her not; sweet Lodowick, depart:
     She is thy wife, and thou shalt be mine heir.

     LODOWICK. O, is't the custom? then I am resolv'd: [90]
     But rather let the brightsome heavens be dim,
     And nature's beauty choke with stifling clouds,
     Than my fair Abigail should frown on me.--
     There comes the villain; now I'll be reveng'd.

          Re-enter MATHIAS.

     BARABAS. Be quiet, Lodowick; it is enough
     That I have made thee sure to Abigail.

     LODOWICK. Well, let him go.
          [Exit.]

     BARABAS. Well, but for me, as you went in at doors
     You had been stabb'd:  but not a word on't now;
     Here must no speeches pass, nor swords be drawn.

     MATHIAS. Suffer me, Barabas, but to follow him.

     BARABAS. No; so shall I, if any hurt be done,
     Be made an accessary of your deeds:
     Revenge it on him when you meet him next.

     MATHIAS. For this I'll have his heart.

     BARABAS. Do so.  Lo, here I give thee Abigail!

     MATHIAS. What greater gift can poor Mathias have?
     Shall Lodowick rob me of so fair a love?
     My life is not so dear as Abigail.

     BARABAS. My heart misgives me, that, to cross your love,
     He's with your mother; therefore after him.

     MATHIAS. What, is he gone unto my mother?

     BARABAS. Nay, if you will, stay till she comes herself.

     MATHIAS. I cannot stay; for, if my mother come,
     She'll die with grief.
          [Exit.]

     ABIGAIL. I cannot take my leave of him for tears.
     Father, why have you thus incens'd them both?

     BARABAS. What's that to thee?

     ABIGAIL. I'll make 'em friends again.

     BARABAS.
     You'll make 'em friends! are there not Jews enow in Malta,
     But thou must dote upon a Christian?

     ABIGAIL. I will have Don Mathias; he is my love.

     BARABAS. Yes, you shall have him.--Go, put her in.

     ITHAMORE. Ay, I'll put her in.
          [Puts in ABIGAIL.]

     BARABAS. Now tell me, Ithamore, how lik'st thou this?

     ITHAMORE. Faith, master, I think by this
     You purchase both their lives:  is it not so?

     BARABAS. True; and it shall be cunningly perform'd.

     ITHAMORE. O, master, that I might have a hand in this!

     BARABAS. Ay, so thou shalt; 'tis thou must do the deed:
     Take this, and bear it to Mathias straight,
          [Giving a letter.]
     And tell him that it comes from Lodowick.

     ITHAMORE. 'Tis poison'd, is it not?

     BARABAS. No, no; and yet it might be done that way:
     It is a challenge feign'd from Lodowick.

     ITHAMORE. Fear not; I will so set his heart a-fire,
     That he shall verily think it comes from him.

     BARABAS. I cannot choose but like thy readiness:
     Yet be not rash, but do it cunningly.

     ITHAMORE. As I behave myself in this, employ me hereafter.

     BARABAS. Away, then!
          [Exit ITHAMORE.]
     So; now will I go in to Lodowick,
     And, like a cunning spirit, feign some lie,
     Till I have set 'em both at enmity.
          [Exit.]




ACT III.

          Enter BELLAMIRA. [91]

     BELLAMIRA. Since this town was besieg'd, my gain grows cold:
     The time has been, that but for one bare night
     A hundred ducats have been freely given;
     But now against my will I must be chaste:
     And yet I know my beauty doth not fail.
     ]From Venice merchants, and from Padua
     Were wont to come rare-witted gentlemen,
     Scholars I mean, learned and liberal;
     And now, save Pilia-Borza, comes there none,
     And he is very seldom from my house;
     And here he comes.

          Enter PILIA-BORZA.

     PILIA-BORZA.
     Hold thee, wench, there's something for thee to spend.
          [Shewing a bag of silver.]

     BELLAMIRA. 'Tis silver; I disdain it.

     PILIA-BORZA. Ay, but the Jew has gold,
     And I will have it, or it shall go hard.

     BELLAMIRA. Tell me, how cam'st thou by this?

     PILIA-BORZA. Faith, walking the back-lanes, through the gardens,
     I chanced to cast mine eye up to the Jew's counting-house, where
     I saw some bags of money, and in the night I clambered up with
     my hooks; and, as I was taking my choice, I heard a rumbling in
     the house; so I took only this, and run my way.--But here's the
     Jew's man.

     BELLAMIRA. Hide the bag.

          Enter ITHAMORE.

     PILIA-BORZA. Look not towards him, let's away.  Zoons, what a
     looking thou keepest! thou'lt betray's anon.
          [Exeunt BELLAMIRA and PILIA-BORZA.]

     ITHAMORE. O, the sweetest face that ever I beheld!  I know she
     is a courtezan by her attire:  now would I give a hundred of
     the Jew's crowns that I had such a concubine.
     Well, I have deliver'd the challenge in such sort,
     As meet they will, and fighting die,--brave sport!
          [Exit.]

          Enter MATHIAS.

     MATHIAS. This is the place: [92]  now Abigail shall see
     Whether Mathias holds her dear or no.

          Enter LODOWICK.

     What, dares the villain write in such base terms?
          [Looking at a letter.]

     LODOWICK. I did it; and revenge it, if thou dar'st!
          [They fight.]

          Enter BARABAS above.

     BARABAS. O, bravely fought! and yet they thrust not home.
     Now, Lodovico! [93] now, Mathias!--So;
          [Both fall.]
     So, now they have shew'd themselves to be tall [94] fellows.

          [Cries within] Part 'em, part 'em!

     BARABAS. Ay, part 'em now they are dead.  Farewell, farewell!
          [Exit above.]

          Enter FERNEZE, KATHARINE, and ATTENDANTS.

     FERNEZE. What sight is this! [95] my Lodovico [96] slain!
     These arms of mine shall be thy sepulchre. [97]

     KATHARINE. Who is this? my son Mathias slain!

     FERNEZE. O Lodowick, hadst thou perish'd by the Turk,
     Wretched Ferneze might have veng'd thy death!

     KATHARINE. Thy son slew mine, and I'll revenge his death.

     FERNEZE. Look, Katharine, look! thy son gave mine these wounds.

     KATHARINE. O, leave to grieve me!  I am griev'd enough.

     FERNEZE. O, that my sighs could turn to lively breath,
     And these my tears to blood, that he might live!

     KATHARINE. Who made them enemies?

     FERNEZE. I know not; and that grieves me most of all.

     KATHARINE. My son lov'd thine.

     FERNEZE. And so did Lodowick him.

     KATHARINE. Lend me that weapon that did kill my son,
     And it shall murder me.

     FERNEZE. Nay, madam, stay; that weapon was my son's,
     And on that rather should Ferneze die.

     KATHARINE. Hold; let's inquire the causers of their deaths,
     That we may venge their blood upon their heads.

     FERNEZE. Then take them up, and let them be interr'd
     Within one sacred monument of stone;
     Upon which altar I will offer up
     My daily sacrifice of sighs and tears,
     And with my prayers pierce impartial heavens,
     Till they [reveal] the causers of our smarts,
     Which forc'd their hands divide united hearts.
     Come, Katharine; [98] our losses equal are;
     Then of true grief let us take equal share.
          [Exeunt with the bodies.]

          Enter ITHAMORE. [99]

     ITHAMORE. Why, was there ever seen such villany,
     So neatly plotted, and so well perform'd?
     Both held in hand, [100] and flatly both beguil'd?

          Enter ABIGAIL.

     ABIGAIL. Why, how now, Ithamore! why laugh'st thou so?

     ITHAMORE. O mistress! ha, ha, ha!

     ABIGAIL. Why, what ail'st thou?

     ITHAMORE. O, my master!

     ABIGAIL. Ha!

     ITHAMORE. O mistress, I have the bravest, gravest, secret,
     subtle, bottle-nosed [101] knave to my master, that ever
     gentleman had!

     ABIGAIL. Say, knave, why rail'st upon my father thus?

     ITHAMORE. O, my master has the bravest policy!

     ABIGAIL. Wherein?

     ITHAMORE. Why, know you not?

     ABIGAIL. Why, no.

     ITHAMORE.
     Know you not of Mathia[s'] and Don Lodowick['s] disaster?

     ABIGAIL. No:  what was it?

     ITHAMORE. Why, the devil inverted a challenge, my master
     writ it, and I carried it, first to Lodowick, and imprimis
     to Mathia[s];
     And then they met, [and], as the story says,
     In doleful wise they ended both their days.

     ABIGAIL. And was my father furtherer of their deaths?

     ITHAMORE. Am I Ithamore?

     ABIGAIL. Yes.

     ITHAMORE.
     So sure did your father write, and I carry the challenge.

     ABIGAIL. Well, Ithamore, let me request thee this;
     Go to the new-made nunnery, and inquire
     For any of the friars of Saint Jaques, [102]
     And say, I pray them come and speak with me.

     ITHAMORE. I pray, mistress, will you answer me to one question?

     ABIGAIL. Well, sirrah, what is't?

     ITHAMORE. A very feeling one:  have not the nuns fine sport with
     the friars now and then?

     ABIGAIL. Go to, Sirrah Sauce! is this your question? get ye gone.

     ITHAMORE. I will, forsooth, mistress.
          [Exit.]

     ABIGAIL. Hard-hearted father, unkind Barabas!
     Was this the pursuit of thy policy,
     To make me shew them favour severally,
     That by my favour they should both be slain?
     Admit thou lov'dst not Lodowick for his sire, [103]
     Yet Don Mathias ne'er offended thee:
     But thou wert set upon extreme revenge,
     Because the prior dispossess'd thee once,
     And couldst not venge it but upon his son;
     Nor on his son but by Mathias' means;
     Nor on Mathias but by murdering me:
     But I perceive there is no love on earth,
     Pity in Jews, nor piety in Turks.--
     But here comes cursed Ithamore with the friar.

          Re-enter ITHAMORE with FRIAR JACOMO.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Virgo, salve.

     ITHAMORE. When duck you?

     ABIGAIL. Welcome, grave friar.--Ithamore, be gone.
          [Exit ITHAMORE.]
     Know, holy sir, I am bold to solicit thee.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Wherein?

     ABIGAIL. To get me be admitted for a nun.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Why, Abigail, it is not yet long since
     That I did labour thy admission,
     And then thou didst not like that holy life.

     ABIGAIL. Then were my thoughts so frail and unconfirm'd
     As [104] I was chain'd to follies of the world:
     But now experience, purchased with grief,
     Has made me see the difference of things.
     My sinful soul, alas, hath pac'd too long
     The fatal labyrinth of misbelief,
     Far from the sun that gives eternal life!

     FRIAR JACOMO. Who taught thee this?

     ABIGAIL. The abbess of the house,
     Whose zealous admonition I embrace:
     O, therefore, Jacomo, let me be one,
     Although unworthy, of that sisterhood!

     FRIAR JACOMO. Abigail, I will:  but see thou change no more,
     For that will be most heavy to thy soul.

     ABIGAIL. That was my father's fault.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Thy father's! how?

     ABIGAIL. Nay, you shall pardon me.--O Barabas,
     Though thou deservest hardly at my hands,
     Yet never shall these lips bewray thy life!
          [Aside.]

     FRIAR JACOMO. Come, shall we go?

     ABIGAIL. My duty waits on you.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter BARABAS, [105] reading a letter.

     BARABAS. What, Abigail become a nun again!
     False and unkind! what, hast thou lost thy father?
     And, all unknown and unconstrain'd of me,
     Art thou again got to the nunnery?
     Now here she writes, and wills me to repent:
     Repentance! Spurca! what pretendeth [106] this?
     I fear she knows--'tis so--of my device
     In Don Mathias' and Lodovico's deaths:
     If so, 'tis time that it be seen into;
     For she that varies from me in belief,
     Gives great presumption that she loves me not,
     Or, loving, doth dislike of something done.--
     But who comes here?

          Enter ITHAMORE.

                         O Ithamore, come near;
     Come near, my love; come near, thy master's life,
     My trusty servant, nay, my second self; [107]
     For I have now no hope but even in thee,
     And on that hope my happiness is built.
     When saw'st thou Abigail?

     ITHAMORE. To-day.

     BARABAS. With whom?

     ITHAMORE. A friar.

     BARABAS. A friar! false villain, he hath done the deed.

     ITHAMORE. How, sir!

     BARABAS. Why, made mine Abigail a nun.

     ITHAMORE. That's no lie; for she sent me for him.

     BARABAS. O unhappy day!
     False, credulous, inconstant Abigail!
     But let 'em go:  and, Ithamore, from hence
     Ne'er shall she grieve me more with her disgrace;
     Ne'er shall she live to inherit aught of mine,
     Be bless'd of me, nor come within my gates,
     But perish underneath my bitter curse,
     Like Cain by Adam for his brother's death.

     ITHAMORE. O master--

     BARABAS. Ithamore, entreat not for her; I am mov'd,
     And she is hateful to my soul and me:
     And, 'less [108] thou yield to this that I entreat,
     I cannot think but that thou hat'st my life.

     ITHAMORE. Who, I, master? why, I'll run to some rock,
     And throw myself headlong into the sea;
     Why, I'll do any thing for your sweet sake.

     BARABAS. O trusty Ithamore! no servant, but my friend!
     I here adopt thee for mine only heir:
     All that I have is thine when I am dead;
     And, whilst I live, use half; spend as myself;
     Here, take my keys,--I'll give 'em thee anon;
     Go buy thee garments; but thou shalt not want:
     Only know this, that thus thou art to do--
     But first go fetch me in the pot of rice
     That for our supper stands upon the fire.

     ITHAMORE. I hold my head, my master's hungry [Aside].--I go, sir.
          [Exit.]

     BARABAS. Thus every villain ambles after wealth,
     Although he ne'er be richer than in hope:--
     But, husht!

          Re-enter ITHAMORE with the pot.

     ITHAMORE. Here 'tis, master.

     BARABAS. Well said, [109] Ithamore!  What, hast thou brought
     The ladle with thee too?

     ITHAMORE. Yes, sir; the proverb says, [110] he that eats with the
     devil had need of a long spoon; I have brought you a ladle.

     BARABAS. Very well, Ithamore; then now be secret;
     And, for thy sake, whom I so dearly love,
     Now shalt thou see the death of Abigail,
     That thou mayst freely live to be my heir.

     ITHAMORE. Why, master, will you poison her with a mess of rice-
     porridge? that will preserve life, make her round and plump, and
     batten [111] more than you are aware.

     BARABAS. Ay, but, Ithamore, seest thou this?
     It is a precious powder that I bought
     Of an Italian, in Ancona, once,
     Whose operation is to bind, infect,
     And poison deeply, yet not appear
     In forty hours after it is ta'en.

     ITHAMORE. How, master?

     BARABAS. Thus, Ithamore:
     This even they use in Malta here,--'tis call'd
     Saint Jaques' Even,--and then, I say, they use
     To send their alms unto the nunneries:
     Among the rest, bear this, and set it there:
     There's a dark entry where they take it in,
     Where they must neither see the messenger,
     Nor make inquiry who hath sent it them.

     ITHAMORE. How so?

     BARABAS. Belike there is some ceremony in't.
     There, Ithamore, must thou go place this pot: [112]
     Stay; let me spice it first.

     ITHAMORE. Pray, do, and let me help you, master.
     Pray, let me taste first.

     BARABAS. Prithee, do.[ITHAMORE tastes.]  What say'st thou now?

     ITHAMORE. Troth, master, I'm loath such a pot of pottage should
     be spoiled.

     BARABAS. Peace, Ithamore! 'tis better so than spar'd.
          [Puts the powder into the pot.]
     Assure thyself thou shalt have broth by the eye: [113]
     My purse, my coffer, and myself is thine.

     ITHAMORE. Well, master, I go.

     BARABAS. Stay; first let me stir it, Ithamore.
     As fatal be it to her as the draught
     Of which great Alexander drunk, and died;
     And with her let it work like Borgia's wine,
     Whereof his sire the Pope was poisoned!
     In few, [114] the blood of Hydra, Lerna's bane,
     The juice of hebon, [115] and Cocytus' breath,
     And all the poisons of the Stygian pool,
     Break from the fiery kingdom, and in this
     Vomit your venom, and envenom her
     That, like a fiend, hath left her father thus!

     ITHAMORE. What a blessing has he given't! was ever pot of
     rice-porridge so sauced? [Aside].--What shall I do with it?

     BARABAS. O my sweet Ithamore, go set it down;
     And come again so soon as thou hast done,
     For I have other business for thee.

     ITHAMORE. Here's a drench to poison a whole stable of Flanders
     mares:  I'll carry't to the nuns with a powder.

     BARABAS. And the horse-pestilence to boot:  away!

     ITHAMORE. I am gone:
     Pay me my wages, for my work is done.
          [Exit with the pot.]

     BARABAS. I'll pay thee with a vengeance, Ithamore!
          [Exit.]

          Enter FERNEZE, [116] MARTIN DEL BOSCO, KNIGHTS, and BASSO.

     FERNEZE. Welcome, great basso: [117]  how fares Calymath?
     What wind drives you thus into Malta-road?

     BASSO. The wind that bloweth all the world besides,
     Desire of gold.

     FERNEZE. Desire of gold, great sir!
     That's to be gotten in the Western Inde:
     In Malta are no golden minerals.

     BASSO. To you of Malta thus saith Calymath:
     The time you took for respite is at hand
     For the performance of your promise pass'd;
     And for the tribute-money I am sent.

     FERNEZE. Basso, in brief, shalt have no tribute here,
     Nor shall the heathens live upon our spoil:
     First will we raze the city-walls ourselves,
     Lay waste the island, hew the temples down,
     And, shipping off our goods to Sicily,
     Open an entrance for the wasteful sea,
     Whose billows, beating the resistless banks, [118]
     Shall overflow it with their refluence.

     BASSO. Well, governor, since thou hast broke the league
     By flat denial of the promis'd tribute,
     Talk not of razing down your city-walls;
     You shall not need trouble yourselves so far,
     For Selim Calymath shall come himself,
     And with brass bullets batter down your towers,
     And turn proud Malta to a wilderness,
     For these intolerable wrongs of yours:
     And so, farewell.

     FERNEZE. Farewell.
          [Exit BASSO.]
     And now, you men of Malta, look about,
     And let's provide to welcome Calymath:
     Close your port-cullis, charge your basilisks, [119]
     And, as you profitably take up arms,
     So now courageously encounter them,
     For by this answer broken is the league,
     And naught is to be look'd for now but wars,
     And naught to us more welcome is than wars.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FRIAR JACOMO [120] and FRIAR BARNARDINE.

     FRIAR JACOMO. O brother, brother, all the nuns are sick,
     And physic will not help them! they must die.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. The abbess sent for me to be confess'd:
     O, what a sad confession will there be!

     FRIAR JACOMO. And so did fair Maria send for me:
     I'll to her lodging; hereabouts she lies.
          [Exit.]

          Enter ABIGAIL.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. What, all dead, save only Abigail!

     ABIGAIL. And I shall die too, for I feel death coming.
     Where is the friar that convers'd with me? [121]

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. O, he is gone to see the other nuns.

     ABIGAIL. I sent for him; but, seeing you are come,
     Be you my ghostly father:  and first know,
     That in this house I liv'd religiously,
     Chaste, and devout, much sorrowing for my sins;
     But, ere I came--

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. What then?

     ABIGAIL. I did offend high heaven so grievously
     As I am almost desperate for my sins;
     And one offense torments me more than all.
     You knew Mathias and Don Lodowick?

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Yes; what of them?

     ABIGAIL. My father did contract me to 'em both;
     First to Don Lodowick:  him I never lov'd;
     Mathias was the man that I held dear,
     And for his sake did I become a nun.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. So:  say how was their end?

     ABIGAIL. Both, jealous of my love, envied [122] each other;
     And by my father's practice, [123] which is there
          [Gives writing.]
     Set down at large, the gallants were both slain.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. O, monstrous villany!

     ABIGAIL. To work my peace, this I confess to thee:
     Reveal it not; for then my father dies.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Know that confession must not be reveal'd;
     The canon-law forbids it, and the priest
     That makes it known, being degraded first,
     Shall be condemn'd, and then sent to the fire.

     ABIGAIL. So I have heard; pray, therefore, keep it close.
     Death seizeth on my heart:  ah, gentle friar,
     Convert my father that he may be sav'd,
     And witness that I die a Christian!
          [Dies.]

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Ay, and a virgin too; that grieves me most.
     But I must to the Jew, and exclaim on him,
     And make him stand in fear of me.

          Re-enter FRIAR JACOMO.

     FRIAR JACOMO. O brother, all the nuns are dead! let's bury them.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. First help to bury this; then go with me,
     And help me to exclaim against the Jew.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Why, what has he done?

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. A thing that makes me tremble to unfold.

     FRIAR JACOMO. What, has he crucified a child? [124]

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. No, but a worse thing: 'twas told me in shrift;
     Thou know'st 'tis death, an if it be reveal'd.
     Come, let's away.
          [Exeunt.]




ACT IV.

          Enter BARABAS [125] and ITHAMORE.  Bells within.

     BARABAS. There is no music to [126] a Christian's knell:
     How sweet the bells ring, now the nuns are dead,
     That sound at other times like tinkers' pans!
     I was afraid the poison had not wrought,
     Or, though it wrought, it would have done no good,
     For every year they swell, and yet they live:
     Now all are dead, not one remains alive.

     ITHAMORE.
     That's brave, master:  but think you it will not be known?

     BARABAS. How can it, if we two be secret?

     ITHAMORE. For my part, fear you not.

     BARABAS. I'd cut thy throat, if I did.

     ITHAMORE. And reason too.
     But here's a royal monastery hard by;
     Good master, let me poison all the monks.

     BARABAS. Thou shalt not need; for, now the nuns are dead,
     They'll die with grief.

     ITHAMORE. Do you not sorrow for your daughter's death?

     BARABAS. No, but I grieve because she liv'd so long,
     An Hebrew born, and would become a Christian:
     Cazzo, [127] diabolo!

     ITHAMORE.
     Look, look, master; here come two religious caterpillars.

          Enter FRIAR JACOMO and FRIAR BARNARDINE.

     BARABAS. I smelt 'em ere they came.

     ITHAMORE. God-a-mercy, nose! [128] Come, let's begone.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Stay, wicked Jew; repent, I say, and stay.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Thou hast offended, therefore must be damn'd.

     BARABAS. I fear they know we sent the poison'd broth.

     ITHAMORE. And so do I, master; therefore speak 'em fair.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Barabas, thou hast--

     FRIAR JACOMO. Ay, that thou hast--

     BARABAS. True, I have money; what though I have?

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Thou art a--

     FRIAR JACOMO. Ay, that thou art, a--

     BARABAS. What needs all this? I know I am a Jew.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Thy daughter--

     FRIAR JACOMO. Ay, thy daughter--

     BARABAS. O, speak not of her! then I die with grief.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Remember that--

     FRIAR JACOMO. Ay, remember that--

     BARABAS. I must needs say that I have been a great usurer.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Thou hast committed--

     BARABAS. Fornication:  but that was in another country;
     And besides, the wench is dead.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Ay, but, Barabas,
     Remember Mathias and Don Lodowick.

     BARABAS. Why, what of them?

     FRIAR BARNARDINE.
     I will not say that by a forged challenge they met.

     BARABAS. She has confess'd, and we are both undone,
     My bosom inmate! [129] but I must dissemble.--
          [Aside to ITHAMORE.]
     O holy friars, the burden of my sins
     Lie heavy [130] on my soul! then, pray you, tell me,
     Is't not too late now to turn Christian?
     I have been zealous in the Jewish faith,
     Hard-hearted to the poor, a covetous wretch,
     That would for lucre's sake have sold my soul;
     A hundred for a hundred I have ta'en;
     And now for store of wealth may I compare
     With all the Jews in Malta:  but what is wealth?
     I am a Jew, and therefore am I lost.
     Would penance serve [to atone] for this my sin,
     I could afford to whip myself to death,--

     ITHAMORE. And so could I; but penance will not serve.

     BARABAS. To fast, to pray, and wear a shirt of hair,
     And on my knees creep to Jerusalem.
     Cellars of wine, and sollars [131] full of wheat,
     Warehouses stuff'd with spices and with drugs,
     Whole chests of gold in bullion and in coin,
     Besides, I know not how much weight in pearl
     Orient and round, have I within my house;
     At Alexandria merchandise untold; [132]
     But yesterday two ships went from this town,
     Their voyage will be worth ten thousand crowns;
     In Florence, Venice, Antwerp, London, Seville,
     Frankfort, Lubeck, Moscow, and where not,
     Have I debts owing; and, in most of these,
     Great sums of money lying in the banco;
     All this I'll give to some religious house,
     So I may be baptiz'd, and live therein.

     FRIAR JACOMO. O good Barabas, come to our house!

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. O, no, good Barabas, come to our house!
     And, Barabas, you know--

     BARABAS. I know that I have highly sinn'd:
     You shall convert me, you shall have all my wealth.

     FRIAR JACOMO. O Barabas, their laws are strict!

     BARABAS. I know they are; and I will be with you.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. They wear no shirts, and they go bare-foot too.

     BARABAS. Then 'tis not for me; and I am resolv'd
     You shall confess me, and have all my goods.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Good Barabas, come to me.

     BARABAS. You see I answer him, and yet he stays;
     Rid him away, and go you home with me.

     FRIAR JACOMO. I'll be with you to-night.

     BARABAS. Come to my house at one o'clock this night.

     FRIAR JACOMO. You hear your answer, and you may be gone.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Why, go, get you away.

     FRIAR JACOMO. I will not go for thee.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Not! then I'll make thee go.

     FRIAR JACOMO. How! dost call me rogue?

          [They fight.]

     ITHAMORE. Part 'em, master, part 'em.

     BARABAS. This is mere frailty:  brethren, be content.--
     Friar Barnardine, go you with Ithamore:
     You know my mind; let me alone with him.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Why does he go to thy house? let him be gone. [133]

     BARABAS. I'll give him something, and so stop his mouth.
          [Exit ITHAMORE with Friar BARNARDINE.]
     I never heard of any man but he
     Malign'd the order of the Jacobins:
     But do you think that I believe his words?
     Why, brother, you converted Abigail;
     And I am bound in charity to requite it,
     And so I will.  O Jacomo, fail not, but come.

     FRIAR JACOMO. But, Barabas, who shall be your godfathers?
     For presently you shall be shriv'd.

     BARABAS. Marry, the Turk [134] shall be one of my godfathers,
     But not a word to any of your covent. [135]

     FRIAR JACOMO. I warrant thee, Barabas.
          [Exit.]

     BARABAS. So, now the fear is past, and I am safe;
     For he that shriv'd her is within my house:
     What, if I murder'd him ere Jacomo comes?
     Now I have such a plot for both their lives,
     As never Jew nor Christian knew the like:
     One turn'd my daughter, therefore he shall die;
     The other knows enough to have my life,
     Therefore 'tis not requisite he should live. [136]
     But are not both these wise men, to suppose
     That I will leave my house, my goods, and all,
     To fast and be well whipt?  I'll none of that.
     Now, Friar Barnardine, I come to you:
     I'll feast you, lodge you, give you fair [137] words,
     And, after that, I and my trusty Turk--
     No more, but so:  it must and shall be done. [138]

          Enter ITHAMORE.

     Ithamore, tell me, is the friar asleep?

     ITHAMORE. Yes; and I know not what the reason is,
     Do what I can, he will not strip himself,
     Nor go to bed, but sleeps in his own clothes:
     I fear me he mistrusts what we intend.

     BARABAS. No; 'tis an order which the friars use:
     Yet, if he knew our meanings, could he scape?

     ITHAMORE. No, none can hear him, cry he ne'er so loud.

     BARABAS. Why, true; therefore did I place him there:
     The other chambers open towards the street.

     ITHAMORE. You loiter, master; wherefore stay we thus?
     O, how I long to see him shake his heels!

     BARABAS. Come on, sirrah:
     Off with your girdle; make a handsome noose.--
          [ITHAMORE takes off his girdle, and ties a noose on it.]
     Friar, awake! [139]
          [They put the noose round the FRIAR'S neck.]

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. What, do you mean to strangle me?

     ITHAMORE. Yes, 'cause you use to confess.

     BARABAS. Blame not us, but the proverb,--Confess and be
     hanged.--Pull hard.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. What, will you have [140] my life?

     BARABAS. Pull hard, I say.--You would have had my goods.

     ITHAMORE. Ay, and our lives too:--therefore pull amain.
          [They strangle the FRIAR.]
     'Tis neatly done, sir; here's no print at all.

     BARABAS. Then is it as it should be.  Take him up.

     ITHAMORE. Nay, master, be ruled by me a little.  [Takes the body,
     sets it upright against the wall, and puts a staff in its hand.]
     So, let him lean upon his staff; excellent! he stands as if he
     were begging of bacon.

     BARABAS. Who would not think but that this friar liv'd?
     What time o' night is't now, sweet Ithamore?

     ITHAMORE. Towards one. [141]

     BARABAS. Then will not Jacomo be long from hence.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FRIAR JACOMO. [142]

     FRIAR JACOMO. This is the hour wherein I shall proceed; [143]
     O happy hour, wherein I shall convert
     An infidel, and bring his gold into our treasury!
     But soft! is not this Barnardine? it is;
     And, understanding I should come this way,
     Stands here o' purpose, meaning me some wrong,
     And intercept my going to the Jew.--
     Barnardine!
     Wilt thou not speak? thou think'st I see thee not;
     Away, I'd wish thee, and let me go by:
     No, wilt thou not? nay, then, I'll force my way;
     And, see, a staff stands ready for the purpose.
     As thou lik'st that, stop me another time!
          [Takes the staff, and strikes down the body.]

          Enter BARABAS and ITHAMORE.

     BARABAS. Why, how now, Jacomo! what hast thou done?

     FRIAR JACOMO. Why, stricken him that would have struck at me.

     BARABAS. Who is it? Barnardine! now, out, alas, he is slain!

     ITHAMORE. Ay, master, he's slain; look how his brains drop out
     on's [144] nose.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Good sirs, I have done't:  but nobody knows it but
     you two; I may escape.

     BARABAS. So might my man and I hang with you for company.

     ITHAMORE. No; let us bear him to the magistrates.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Good Barabas, let me go.

     BARABAS. No, pardon me; the law must have his course:
     I must be forc'd to give in evidence,
     That, being importun'd by this Barnardine
     To be a Christian, I shut him out,
     And there he sate:  now I, to keep my word,
     And give my goods and substance to your house,
     Was up thus early, with intent to go
     Unto your friary, because you stay'd.

     ITHAMORE. Fie upon 'em! master, will you turn Christian, when
     holy friars turn devils and murder one another?

     BARABAS. No; for this example I'll remain a Jew:
     Heaven bless me! what, a friar a murderer!
     When shall you see a Jew commit the like?

     ITHAMORE. Why, a Turk could ha' done no more.

     BARABAS. To-morrow is the sessions; you shall to it.--
     Come, Ithamore, let's help to take him hence.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Villains, I am a sacred person; touch me not.

     BARABAS. The law shall touch you; we'll but lead you, we:
     'Las, I could weep at your calamity!--
     Take in the staff too, for that must be shown:
     Law wills that each particular be known.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter BELLAMIRA [145] and PILIA-BORZA.

     BELLAMIRA. Pilia-Borza, didst thou meet with Ithamore?

     PILIA-BORZA. I did.

     BELLAMIRA. And didst thou deliver my letter?

     PILIA-BORZA. I did.

     BELLAMIRA. And what thinkest thou? will he come?

     PILIA-BORZA. I think so:  and yet I cannot tell; for, at the
     reading of the letter, he looked like a man of another world.

     BELLAMIRA. Why so?

     PILIA-BORZA. That such a base slave as he should be saluted by
     such a tall [146] man as I am, from such a beautiful dame as you.

     BELLAMIRA. And what said he?

     PILIA-BORZA. Not a wise word; only gave me a nod, as who should
     say, "Is it even so?" and so I left him, being driven to a
     non-plus at the critical aspect of my terrible countenance.

     BELLAMIRA. And where didst meet him?

     PILIA-BORZA. Upon mine own free-hold, within forty foot of the
     gallows, conning his neck-verse, [147] I take it, looking of [148]
     a friar's execution; whom I saluted with an old hempen proverb,
     Hodie tibi, cras mihi, and so I left him to the mercy of the
     hangman:  but, the exercise [149] being done, see where he comes.

          Enter ITHAMORE.

     ITHAMORE. I never knew a man take his death so patiently as
     this friar; he was ready to leap off ere the halter was about
     his neck; and, when the hangman had put on his hempen tippet,
     he made such haste to his prayers, as if he had had another
     cure to serve.  Well, go whither he will, I'll be none of his
     followers in haste:  and, now I think on't, going to the
     execution, a fellow met me with a muschatoes [150] like a raven's
     wing, and a dagger with a hilt like a warming-pan; and he gave
     me a letter from one Madam Bellamira, saluting me in such sort
     as if he had meant to make clean my boots with his lips; the
     effect was, that I should come to her house:  I wonder what the
     reason is; it may be she sees more in me than I can find in
     myself; for she writes further, that she loves me ever since she
     saw me; and who would not requite such love?  Here's her house;
     and here she comes; and now would I were gone!  I am not worthy
     to look upon her.

     PILIA-BORZA. This is the gentleman you writ to.

     ITHAMORE. Gentleman! he flouts me:  what gentry can be in a poor
     Turk of tenpence? [151]  I'll be gone.
          [Aside.]

     BELLAMIRA. Is't not a sweet-faced youth, Pilia?

     ITHAMORE. Again, sweet youth! [Aside.]--Did not you, sir, bring
     the sweet youth a letter?

     PILIA-BORZA. I did, sir, and from this gentlewoman, who, as
     myself and the rest of the family, stand or fall at your service.

     BELLAMIRA. Though woman's modesty should hale me back,
     I can withhold no longer:  welcome, sweet love.

     ITHAMORE. Now am I clean, or rather foully, out of the way.
          [Aside.]

     BELLAMIRA. Whither so soon?

     ITHAMORE. I'll go steal some money from my master to make me
     handsome [Aside].--Pray, pardon me; I must go see a ship
     discharged.

     BELLAMIRA. Canst thou be so unkind to leave me thus?

     PILIA-BORZA. An ye did but know how she loves you, sir!

     ITHAMORE. Nay, I care not how much she loves me.--Sweet
     Bellamira, would I had my master's wealth for thy sake!

     PILIA-BORZA. And you can have it, sir, an if you please.

     ITHAMORE. If 'twere above ground, I could, and would have it;
     but he hides and buries it up, as partridges do their eggs,
     under the earth.

     PILIA-BORZA. And is't not possible to find it out?

     ITHAMORE. By no means possible.

     BELLAMIRA. What shall we do with this base villain, then?
          [Aside to PILIA-BORZA.]

     PILIA-BORZA. Let me alone; do but you speak him fair.--
          [Aside to her.]
     But you know [152] some secrets of the Jew,
     Which, if they were reveal'd, would do him harm.

     ITHAMORE. Ay, and such as--go to, no more! I'll make him [153]
     send me half he has, and glad he scapes so too:  I'll write unto
     him; we'll have money straight.

     PILIA-BORZA. Send for a hundred crowns at least.

     ITHAMORE. Ten hundred thousand crowns.--[writing] MASTER BARABAS,--

     PILIA-BORZA. Write not so submissively, but threatening him.

     ITHAMORE. [writing] SIRRAH BARABAS, SEND ME A HUNDRED CROWNS.

     PILIA-BORZA. Put in two hundred at least.

     ITHAMORE. [writing] I CHARGE THEE SEND ME THREE HUNDRED BY THIS
     BEARER, AND THIS SHALL BE YOUR WARRANT:  IF YOU DO NOT--NO MORE,
     BUT SO.

     PILIA-BORZA. Tell him you will confess.

     ITHAMORE. [writing] OTHERWISE I'LL CONFESS ALL.--
     Vanish, and return in a twinkle.

     PILIA-BORZA. Let me alone; I'll use him in his kind.

     ITHAMORE. Hang him, Jew!
          [Exit PILIA-BORZA with the letter.]

     BELLAMIRA. Now, gentle Ithamore, lie in my lap.--
     Where are my maids? provide a cunning [154] banquet;
     Send to the merchant, bid him bring me silks;
     Shall Ithamore, my love, go in such rags?

     ITHAMORE. And bid the jeweller come hither too.

     BELLAMIRA. I have no husband; sweet, I'll marry thee.

     ITHAMORE. Content:  but we will leave this paltry land,
     And sail from hence to Greece, to lovely Greece;--
     I'll be thy Jason, thou my golden fleece;--
     Where painted carpets o'er the meads are hurl'd,
     And Bacchus' vineyards overspread the world;
     Where woods and forests go in goodly green;--
     I'll be Adonis, thou shalt be Love's Queen;--
     The meads, the orchards, and the primrose-lanes,
     Instead of sedge and reed, bear sugar-canes:
     Thou in those groves, by Dis above,
     Shalt live with me, and be my love. [155]

     BELLAMIRA. Whither will I not go with gentle Ithamore?

          Re-enter PILIA-BORZA.

     ITHAMORE. How now! hast thou the gold [?]

     PILIA-BORZA. Yes.

     ITHAMORE. But came it freely? did the cow give down her milk
     freely?

     PILIA-BORZA. At reading of the letter, he stared and stamped,
     and turned aside:  I took him by the beard, [156] and looked upon
     him thus; told him he were best to send it:  then he hugged and
     embraced me.

     ITHAMORE. Rather for fear than love.

     PILIA-BORZA. Then, like a Jew, he laughed and jeered, and told
     me he loved me for your sake, and said what a faithful servant
     you had been.

     ITHAMORE. The more villain he to keep me thus:  here's goodly
     'parel, is there not?

     PILIA-BORZA. To conclude, he gave me ten crowns.
          [Delivers the money to ITHAMORE.]

     ITHAMORE. But ten? I'll not leave him worth a grey groat.  Give
     me a ream of paper:  we'll have a kingdom of gold for't. [157]

     PILIA-BORZA. Write for five hundred crowns.

     ITHAMORE. [writing] SIRRAH JEW, AS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE, SEND ME
     FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS, AND GIVE THE BEARER A HUNDRED.--Tell him
     I must have't.

     PILIA-BORZA. I warrant, your worship shall have't.

     ITHAMORE. And, if he ask why I demand so much, tell him I scorn
     to write a line under a hundred crowns.

     PILIA-BORZA. You'd make a rich poet, sir.  I am gone.
          [Exit with the letter.]

     ITHAMORE. Take thou the money; spend it for my sake.

     BELLAMIRA. 'Tis not thy money, but thyself I weigh:
     Thus Bellamira esteems of gold;
          [Throws it aside.]
     But thus of thee.
          [Kisses him.]

     ITHAMORE. That kiss again!--She runs division [158] of my
     lips.  What an eye she casts on me! it twinkles like a star.
          [Aside.]

     BELLAMIRA. Come, my dear love, let's in and sleep together.

     ITHAMORE. O, that ten thousand nights were put in one, that
     we might sleep seven years together afore we wake!

     BELLAMIRA. Come, amorous wag, first banquet, and then sleep.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter BARABAS, [159] reading a letter.

     BARABAS. BARABAS, SEND ME THREE HUNDRED CROWNS;--
     Plain Barabas!  O, that wicked courtezan!
     He was not wont to call me Barabas;--
     OR ELSE I WILL CONFESS;--ay, there it goes:
     But, if I get him, coupe de gorge for that.
     He sent a shaggy, tatter'd, [160] staring slave,
     That, when he speaks, draws out his grisly beard,
     And winds it twice or thrice about his ear;
     Whose face has been a grind-stone for men's swords;
     His hands are hack'd, some fingers cut quite off;
     Who, when he speaks, grunts like a hog, and looks
     Like one that is employ'd in catzery [161]
     And cross-biting; [162] such a rogue
     As is the husband to a hundred whores;
     And I by him must send three hundred crowns.
     Well, my hope is, he will not stay there still;
     And, when he comes--O, that he were but here!

          Enter PILIA-BORZA.

     PILIA-BORZA. Jew, I must ha' more gold.

     BARABAS. Why, want'st thou any of thy tale? [163]

     PILIA-BORZA. No; but three hundred will not serve his turn.

     BARABAS. Not serve his turn, sir!

     PILIA-BORZA.
     No, sir; and therefore I must have five hundred more.

     BARABAS. I'll rather----

     PILIA-BORZA. O, good words, sir, and send it you were best! see,
     there's his letter.
          [Gives letter.]

     BARABAS. Might he not as well come as send? pray, bid him come
     and fetch it:  what he writes for you, [164] ye shall have
     straight.

     PILIA-BORZA. Ay, and the rest too, or else----

     BARABAS. I must make this villain away [Aside].--Please you dine
     with me, sir--and you shall be most heartily poisoned.
          [Aside.]

     PILIA-BORZA. No, God-a-mercy.  Shall I have these crowns?

     BARABAS. I cannot do it; I have lost my keys.

     PILIA-BORZA. O, if that be all, I can pick ope your locks.

     BARABAS.
     Or climb up to my counting-house window:  you know my meaning.

     PILIA-BORZA. I know enough, and therefore talk not to me of
     your counting-house.  The gold! or know, Jew, it is in my power
     to hang thee.

     BARABAS. I am betray'd.--
          [Aside.]
     'Tis not five hundred crowns that I esteem;
     I am not mov'd at that:  this angers me,
     That he, who knows I love him as myself,
     Should write in this imperious vein.  Why, sir,
     You know I have no child, and unto whom
     Should I leave all, but unto Ithamore?

     PILIA-BORZA. Here's many words, but no crowns:  the crowns!

     BARABAS. Commend me to him, sir, most humbly,
     And unto your good mistress as unknown.

     PILIA-BORZA. Speak, shall I have 'em, sir?

     BARABAS. Sir, here they are.--
          [Gives money.]
     O, that I should part [165] with so much gold!--
          [Aside.]
     Here, take 'em, fellow, with as good a will----
     As I would see thee hang'd [Aside].  O, love stops my breath!
     Never lov'd man servant as I do Ithamore.

     PILIA-BORZA. I know it, sir.

     BARABAS. Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?

     PILIA-BORZA. Soon enough to your cost, sir.  Fare you well.
          [Exit.]

     BARABAS. Nay, to thine own cost, villain, if thou com'st!
     Was ever Jew tormented as I am?
     To have a shag-rag knave to come [force from me]
     Three hundred crowns, and then five hundred crowns!
     Well; I must seek a means to rid [166] 'em all,
     And presently; for in his villany
     He will tell all he knows, and I shall die for't.
     I have it:
     I will in some disguise go see the slave,
     And how the villain revels with my gold.
          [Exit.]

          Enter BELLAMIRA, [167] ITHAMORE, and PILIA-BORZA.

     BELLAMIRA. I'll pledge thee, love, and therefore drink it off.

     ITHAMORE. Say'st thou me so? have at it! and do you hear?
          [Whispers to her.]

     BELLAMIRA. Go to, it shall be so.

     ITHAMORE. Of [168] that condition I will drink it up:
     Here's to thee.

     BELLAMIRA. [169] Nay, I'll have all or none.

     ITHAMORE. There, if thou lov'st me, do not leave a drop.

     BELLAMIRA. Love thee! fill me three glasses.

     ITHAMORE. Three and fifty dozen:  I'll pledge thee.

     PILIA-BORZA. Knavely spoke, and like a knight-at-arms.

     ITHAMORE. Hey, Rivo Castiliano! [170] a man's a man.

     BELLAMIRA. Now to the Jew.

     ITHAMORE. Ha! to the Jew; and send me money he [171] were best.

     PILIA-BORZA. What wouldst thou do, if he should send thee none?

     ITHAMORE. Do nothing:  but I know what I know; he's a murderer.

     BELLAMIRA. I had not thought he had been so brave a man.

     ITHAMORE. You knew Mathias and the governor's son; he and I
     killed 'em both, and yet never touched 'em.

     PILIA-BORZA. O, bravely done!

     ITHAMORE. I carried the broth that poisoned the nuns; and he
     and I, snicle hand too fast, strangled a friar. [172]

     BELLAMIRA. You two alone?

     ITHAMORE.
     We two; and 'twas never known, nor never shall be for me.

     PILIA-BORZA. This shall with me unto the governor.
          [Aside to BELLAMIRA.]

     BELLAMIRA. And fit it should:  but first let's ha' more gold.--
          [Aside to PILIA-BORZA.]
     Come, gentle Ithamore, lie in my lap.

     ITHAMORE. Love me little, love me long:  let music rumble,
     Whilst I in thy incony [173] lap do tumble.

          Enter BARABAS, disguised as a French musician, with a lute,
          and a nosegay in his hat.

     BELLAMIRA. A French musician!--Come, let's hear your skill.

     BARABAS. Must tuna my lute for sound, twang, twang, first.

     ITHAMORE. Wilt drink, Frenchman? here's to thee with a--Pox on
     this drunken hiccup!

     BARABAS. Gramercy, monsieur.

     BELLAMIRA. Prithee, Pilia-Borza, bid the fiddler give me the
     posy in his hat there.

     PILIA-BORZA. Sirrah, you must give my mistress your posy.

     BARABAS. A votre commandement, madame.
          [Giving nosegay.]

     BELLAMIRA. How sweet, my Ithamore, the flowers smell!

     ITHAMORE. Like thy breath, sweetheart; no violet like 'em.

     PILIA-BORZA. Foh! methinks they stink like a hollyhock. [174]

     BARABAS. So, now I am reveng'd upon 'em all:
     The scent thereof was death; I poison'd it.
          [Aside.]

     ITHAMORE.
     Play, fiddler, or I'll cut your cat's guts into chitterlings.

     BARABAS.
     Pardonnez moi, be no in tune yet:  so, now, now all be in.

     ITHAMORE. Give him a crown, and fill me out more wine.

     PILIA-BORZA. There's two crowns for thee:  play.
          [Giving money.]

     BARABAS. How liberally the villain gives me mine own gold!
          [Aside, and then plays.]

     PILIA-BORZA. Methinks he fingers very well.

     BARABAS. So did you when you stole my gold.
          [Aside.]

     PILIA-BORZA. How swift he runs!

     BARABAS. You run swifter when you threw my gold out of my window.
          [Aside.]

     BELLAMIRA. Musician, hast been in Malta long?

     BARABAS. Two, three, four month, madam.

     ITHAMORE. Dost not know a Jew, one Barabas?

     BARABAS. Very mush:  monsieur, you no be his man?

     PILIA-BORZA. His man!

     ITHAMORE. I scorn the peasant:  tell him so.

     BARABAS. He knows it already.
          [Aside.]

     ITHAMORE. 'Tis a strange thing of that Jew, he lives upon
     pickled grasshoppers and sauced mushrooms. [175]

     BARABAS. What a slave's this! the governor feeds not as I do.
          [Aside.]

     ITHAMORE. He never put on clean shirt since he was circumcised.

     BARABAS. O rascal! I change myself twice a-day.
          [Aside.]

     ITHAMORE. The hat he wears, Judas left under the elder when he
     hanged himself. [176]

     BARABAS. 'Twas sent me for a present from the Great Cham.
          [Aside.]

     PILIA-BORZA. A nasty [177] slave he is.--Whither now, fiddler?

     BARABAS. Pardonnez moi, monsieur; me [178] be no well.

     PILIA-BORZA. Farewell, fiddler [Exit BARABAS.] One letter more
     to the Jew.

     BELLAMIRA. Prithee, sweet love, one more, and write it sharp.

     ITHAMORE. No, I'll send by word of mouth now.
     --Bid him deliver thee a thousand crowns, by the same token
     that the nuns loved rice, that Friar Barnardine slept in his
     own clothes; any of 'em will do it.

     PILIA-BORZA. Let me alone to urge it, now I know the meaning.

     ITHAMORE. The meaning has a meaning.  Come, let's in:
     To undo a Jew is charity, and not sin.
          [Exeunt.]




ACT V.

          Enter FERNEZE, [179] KNIGHTS, MARTIN DEL BOSCO, and OFFICERS.

     FERNEZE. Now, gentlemen, betake you to your arms,
     And see that Malta be well fortified;
     And it behoves you to be resolute;
     For Calymath, having hover'd here so long,
     Will win the town, or die before the walls.

     FIRST KNIGHT. And die he shall; for we will never yield.

          Enter BELLAMIRA and PILIA-BORZA.

     BELLAMIRA. O, bring us to the governor!

     FERNEZE. Away with her! she is a courtezan.

     BELLAMIRA. Whate'er I am, yet, governor, hear me speak:
     I bring thee news by whom thy son was slain:
     Mathias did it not; it was the Jew.

     PILIA-BORZA. Who, besides the slaughter of these gentlemen,
     Poison'd his own daughter and the nuns,
     Strangled a friar, and I know not what
     Mischief beside.

     FERNEZE. Had we but proof of this----

     BELLAMIRA. Strong proof, my lord:  his man's now at my lodging,
     That was his agent; he'll confess it all.

     FERNEZE. Go fetch him [180] straight [Exeunt OFFICERS].
     I always fear'd that Jew.

          Re-enter OFFICERS with BARABAS and ITHAMORE.

     BARABAS. I'll go alone; dogs, do not hale me thus.

     ITHAMORE.
     Nor me neither; I cannot out-run you, constable.--O, my belly!

     BARABAS. One dram of powder more had made all sure:
     What a damn'd slave was I!
          [Aside.]

     FERNEZE. Make fires, heat irons, let the rack be fetch'd.

     FIRST KNIGHT. Nay, stay, my lord; 't may be he will confess.

     BARABAS. Confess! what mean you, lords? who should confess?

     FERNEZE. Thou and thy Turk; 'twas that slew my son.

     ITHAMORE. Guilty, my lord, I confess.  Your son and Mathias
     were both contracted unto Abigail: [he] forged a counterfeit
     challenge.

     BARABAS. Who carried that challenge?

     ITHAMORE.
     I carried it, I confess; but who writ it? marry, even he that
     strangled Barnardine, poisoned the nuns and his own daughter.

     FERNEZE. Away with him! his sight is death to me.

     BARABAS. For what, you men of Malta? hear me speak.
     She is a courtezan, and he a thief,
     And he my bondman:  let me have law;
     For none of this can prejudice my life.

     FERNEZE. Once more, away with him!--You shall have law.

     BARABAS. Devils, do your worst!--I['ll] live in spite of you.--
          [Aside.]
     As these have spoke, so be it to their souls!--
     I hope the poison'd flowers will work anon.
          [Aside.]
          [Exeunt OFFICERS with BARABAS and ITHAMORE; BELLAMIRA,
          and PILIA-BORZA.]

          Enter KATHARINE.

     KATHARINE. Was my Mathias murder'd by the Jew?
     Ferneze, 'twas thy son that murder'd him.

     FERNEZE. Be patient, gentle madam:  it was he;
     He forg'd the daring challenge made them fight.

     KATHARINE. Where is the Jew? where is that murderer?

     FERNEZE. In prison, till the law has pass'd on him.

          Re-enter FIRST OFFICER.

     FIRST OFFICER. My lord, the courtezan and her man are dead;
     So is the Turk and Barabas the Jew.

     FERNEZE. Dead!

     FIRST OFFICER. Dead, my lord, and here they bring his body.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. This sudden death of his is very strange.

          Re-enter OFFICERS, carrying BARABAS as dead.

     FERNEZE. Wonder not at it, sir; the heavens are just;
     Their deaths were like their lives; then think not of 'em.--
     Since they are dead, let them be buried:
     For the Jew's body, throw that o'er the walls,
     To be a prey for vultures and wild beasts.--
     So, now away and fortify the town.

          Exeunt all, leaving BARABAS on the floor. [181]

     BARABAS. [rising] What, all alone! well fare, sleepy drink!
     I'll be reveng'd on this accursed town;
     For by my means Calymath shall enter in:
     I'll help to slay their children and their wives,
     To fire the churches, pull their houses down,
     Take my goods too, and seize upon my lands.
     I hope to see the governor a slave,
     And, rowing in a galley, whipt to death.

          Enter CALYMATH, BASSOES, [182] and TURKS.

     CALYMATH. Whom have we there? a spy?

     BARABAS. Yes, my good lord, one that can spy a place
     Where you may enter, and surprize the town:
     My name is Barabas; I am a Jew.

     CALYMATH. Art thou that Jew whose goods we heard were sold
     For tribute-money?

     BARABAS. The very same, my lord:
     And since that time they have hir'd a slave, my man,
     To accuse me of a thousand villanies:
     I was imprisoned, but scap [']d their hands.

     CALYMATH. Didst break prison?

     BARABAS. No, no:
     I drank of poppy and cold mandrake juice;
     And being asleep, belike they thought me dead,
     And threw me o'er the walls:  so, or how else,
     The Jew is here, and rests at your command.

     CALYMATH. 'Twas bravely done:  but tell me, Barabas,
     Canst thou, as thou report'st, make Malta ours?

     BARABAS. Fear not, my lord; for here, against the trench, [183]
     The rock is hollow, and of purpose digg'd,
     To make a passage for the running streams
     And common channels [184] of the city.
     Now, whilst you give assault unto the walls,
     I'll lead five hundred soldiers through the vault,
     And rise with them i' the middle of the town,
     Open the gates for you to enter in;
     And by this means the city is your own.

     CALYMATH. If this be true, I'll make thee governor.

     BARABAS. And, if it be not true, then let me die.

     CALYMATH. Thou'st doom'd thyself.--Assault it presently.
          [Exeunt.]

          Alarums within.  Enter CALYMATH, [185] BASSOES, TURKS, and
          BARABAS; with FERNEZE and KNIGHTS prisoners.

     CALYMATH. Now vail [186] your pride, you captive Christians,
     And kneel for mercy to your conquering foe:
     Now where's the hope you had of haughty Spain?
     Ferneze, speak; had it not been much better
     To kept [187] thy promise than be thus surpris'd?

     FERNEZE. What should I say? we are captives, and must yield.

     CALYMATH. Ay, villains, you must yield, and under Turkish yokes
     Shall groaning bear the burden of our ire:--
     And, Barabas, as erst we promis'd thee,
     For thy desert we make thee governor;
     Use them at thy discretion.

     BARABAS. Thanks, my lord.

     FERNEZE. O fatal day, to fall into the hands
     Of such a traitor and unhallow'd Jew!
     What greater misery could heaven inflict?

     CALYMATH. 'Tis our command:--and, Barabas, we give,
     To guard thy person, these our Janizaries:
     Entreat [188] them well, as we have used thee.--
     And now, brave bassoes, [189] come; we'll walk about
     The ruin'd town, and see the wreck we made.--
     Farewell, brave Jew, farewell, great Barabas!

     BARABAS. May all good fortune follow Calymath!
          [Exeunt CALYMATH and BASSOES.]
     And now, as entrance to our safety,
     To prison with the governor and these
     Captains, his consorts and confederates.

     FERNEZE. O villain! heaven will be reveng'd on thee.

     BARABAS. Away! no more; let him not trouble me.
          [Exeunt TURKS with FERNEZE and KNIGHTS.]
     Thus hast thou gotten, [190] by thy policy,
     No simple place, no small authority:
     I now am governor of Malta; true,--
     But Malta hates me, and, in hating me,
     My life's in danger; and what boots it thee,
     Poor Barabas, to be the governor,
     Whenas [191] thy life shall be at their command?
     No, Barabas, this must be look'd into;
     And, since by wrong thou gott'st authority,
     Maintain it bravely by firm policy;
     At least, unprofitably lose it not;
     For he that liveth in authority,
     And neither gets him friends nor fills his bags,
     Lives like the ass that Aesop speaketh of,
     That labours with a load of bread and wine,
     And leaves it off to snap on thistle-tops:
     But Barabas will be more circumspect.
     Begin betimes; Occasion's bald behind:
     Slip not thine opportunity, for fear too late
     Thou seek'st for much, but canst not compass it.--
     Within here! [192]

          Enter FERNEZE, with a GUARD.

     FERNEZE. My lord?

     BARABAS. Ay, LORD; thus slaves will learn.
     Now, governor,--stand by there, wait within,--
          [Exeunt GUARD.]
     This is the reason that I sent for thee:
     Thou seest thy life and Malta's happiness
     Are at my arbitrement; and Barabas
     At his discretion may dispose of both:
     Now tell me, governor, and plainly too,
     What think'st thou shall become of it and thee?

     FERNEZE. This, Barabas; since things are in thy power,
     I see no reason but of Malta's wreck,
     Nor hope of thee but extreme cruelty:
     Nor fear I death, nor will I flatter thee.

     BARABAS. Governor, good words; be not so furious
     'Tis not thy life which can avail me aught;
     Yet you do live, and live for me you shall:
     And as for Malta's ruin, think you not
     'Twere slender policy for Barabas
     To dispossess himself of such a place?
     For sith, [193] as once you said, within this isle,
     In Malta here, that I have got my goods,
     And in this city still have had success,
     And now at length am grown your governor,
     Yourselves shall see it shall not be forgot;
     For, as a friend not known but in distress,
     I'll rear up Malta, now remediless.

     FERNEZE. Will Barabas recover Malta's loss?
     Will Barabas be good to Christians?

     BARABAS. What wilt thou give me, governor, to procure
     A dissolution of the slavish bands
     Wherein the Turk hath yok'd your land and you?
     What will you give me if I render you
     The life of Calymath, surprise his men,
     And in an out-house of the city shut
     His soldiers, till I have consum'd 'em all with fire?
     What will you give him that procureth this?

     FERNEZE. Do but bring this to pass which thou pretendest,
     Deal truly with us as thou intimatest,
     And I will send amongst the citizens,
     And by my letters privately procure
     Great sums of money for thy recompense:
     Nay, more, do this, and live thou governor still.

     BARABAS. Nay, do thou this, Ferneze, and be free:
     Governor, I enlarge thee; live with me;
     Go walk about the city, see thy friends:
     Tush, send not letters to 'em; go thyself,
     And let me see what money thou canst make:
     Here is my hand that I'll set Malta free;
     And thus we cast [194] it:  to a solemn feast
     I will invite young Selim Calymath,
     Where be thou present, only to perform
     One stratagem that I'll impart to thee,
     Wherein no danger shall betide thy life,
     And I will warrant Malta free for ever.

     FERNEZE. Here is my hand; believe me, Barabas,
     I will be there, and do as thou desirest.
     When is the time?

     BARABAS. Governor, presently;
     For Calymath, when he hath view'd the town,
     Will take his leave, and sail toward Ottoman.

     FERNEZE. Then will I, Barabas, about this coin,
     And bring it with me to thee in the evening.

     BARABAS. Do so; but fail not:  now farewell, Ferneze:--
          [Exit FERNEZE.]
     And thus far roundly goes the business:
     Thus, loving neither, will I live with both,
     Making a profit of my policy;
     And he from whom my most advantage comes,
     Shall be my friend.
     This is the life we Jews are us'd to lead;
     And reason too, for Christians do the like.
     Well, now about effecting this device;
     First, to surprise great Selim's soldiers,
     And then to make provision for the feast,
     That at one instant all things may be done:
     My policy detests prevention.
     To what event my secret purpose drives,
     I know; and they shall witness with their lives.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter CALYMATH and BASSOES. [195]

     CALYMATH. Thus have we view'd the city, seen the sack,
     And caus'd the ruins to be new-repair'd,
     Which with our bombards' shot and basilisk[s] [196]
     We rent in sunder at our entry:
     And, now I see the situation,
     And how secure this conquer'd island stands,
     Environ'd with the Mediterranean sea,
     Strong-countermin'd with other petty isles,
     And, toward Calabria, [197] back'd by Sicily
     (Where Syracusian Dionysius reign'd),
     Two lofty turrets that command the town,
     I wonder how it could be conquer'd thus.

          Enter a MESSENGER.

     MESSENGER. From Barabas, Malta's governor, I bring
     A message unto mighty Calymath:
     Hearing his sovereign was bound for sea,
     To sail to Turkey, to great Ottoman,
     He humbly would entreat your majesty
     To come and see his homely citadel,
     And banquet with him ere thou leav'st the isle.

     CALYMATH. To banquet with him in his citadel!
     I fear me, messenger, to feast my train
     Within a town of war so lately pillag'd,
     Will be too costly and too troublesome:
     Yet would I gladly visit Barabas,
     For well has Barabas deserv'd of us.

     MESSENGER. Selim, for that, thus saith the governor,--
     That he hath in [his] store a pearl so big,
     So precious, and withal so orient,
     As, be it valu'd but indifferently,
     The price thereof will serve to entertain
     Selim and all his soldiers for a month;
     Therefore he humbly would entreat your highness
     Not to depart till he has feasted you.

     CALYMATH. I cannot feast my men in Malta-walls,
     Except he place his tables in the streets.

     MESSENGER. Know, Selim, that there is a monastery
     Which standeth as an out-house to the town;
     There will he banquet them; but thee at home,
     With all thy bassoes and brave followers.

     CALYMATH. Well, tell the governor we grant his suit;
     We'll in this summer-evening feast with him.

     MESSENGER. I shall, my lord.
          [Exit.]

     CALYMATH. And now, bold bassoes, let us to our tents,
     And meditate how we may grace us best,
     To solemnize our governor's great feast.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FERNEZE, [198] KNIGHTS, and MARTIN DEL BOSCO.

     FERNEZE. In this, my countrymen, be rul'd by me:
     Have special care that no man sally forth
     Till you shall hear a culverin discharg'd
     By him that bears the linstock, [199] kindled thus;
     Then issue out and come to rescue me,
     For happily I shall be in distress,
     Or you released of this servitude.

     FIRST KNIGHT. Rather than thus to live as Turkish thralls,
     What will we not adventure?

     FERNEZE. On, then; be gone.

     KNIGHTS. Farewell, grave governor.
          [Exeunt, on one side, KNIGHTS and MARTIN DEL BOSCO;
          on the other, FERNEZE.]

          Enter, above, [200] BARABAS, with a hammer, very busy;
          and CARPENTERS.

     BARABAS. How stand the cords? how hang these hinges? fast?
     Are all the cranes and pulleys sure?

     FIRST CARPENTER. [201] All fast.

     BARABAS. Leave nothing loose, all levell'd to my mind.
     Why, now I see that you have art, indeed:
     There, carpenters, divide that gold amongst you;
          [Giving money.]
     Go, swill in bowls of sack and muscadine;
     Down to the cellar, taste of all my wines.

     FIRST CARPENTER. We shall, my lord, and thank you.
          [Exeunt CARPENTERS.]

     BARABAS. And, if you like them, drink your fill and die;
     For, so I live, perish may all the world!
     Now, Selim Calymath, return me word
     That thou wilt come, and I am satisfied.

          Enter MESSENGER.

     Now, sirrah; what, will he come?

     MESSENGER. He will; and has commanded all his men
     To come ashore, and march through Malta-streets,
     That thou mayst feast them in thy citadel.

     BARABAS. Then now are all things as my wish would have 'em;
     There wanteth nothing but the governor's pelf;
     And see, he brings it.

          Enter FERNEZE.

                             Now, governor, the sum?

     FERNEZE. With free consent, a hundred thousand pounds.

     BARABAS. Pounds say'st thou, governor? well, since it is no more,
     I'll satisfy myself with that; nay, keep it still,
     For, if I keep not promise, trust not me:
     And, governor, now partake my policy.
     First, for his army, they are sent before,
     Enter'd the monastery, and underneath
     In several places are field-pieces pitch'd,
     Bombards, whole barrels full of gunpowder,
     That on the sudden shall dissever it,
     And batter all the stones about their ears,
     Whence none can possibly escape alive:
     Now, as for Calymath and his consorts,
     Here have I made a dainty gallery,
     The floor whereof, this cable being cut,
     Doth fall asunder, so that it doth sink
     Into a deep pit past recovery.
     Here, hold that knife; and, when thou seest he comes,
          [Throws down a knife.]
     And with his bassoes shall be blithely set,
     A warning-piece shall be shot off [202] from the tower,
     To give thee knowledge when to cut the cord,
     And fire the house.  Say, will not this be brave?

     FERNEZE. O, excellent! here, hold thee, Barabas;
     I trust thy word; take what I promis'd thee.

     BARABAS. No, governor; I'll satisfy thee first;
     Thou shalt not live in doubt of any thing.
     Stand close, for here they come.
          [FERNEZE retires.]
                                       Why, is not this
     A kingly kind of trade, to purchase towns
     By treachery, and sell 'em by deceit?
     Now tell me, worldlings, underneath the sun [203]
     If greater falsehood ever has been done?

          Enter CALYMATH and BASSOES.

     CALYMATH. Come, my companion-bassoes:  see, I pray,
     How busy Barabas is there above
     To entertain us in his gallery:
     Let us salute him.--Save thee, Barabas!

     BARABAS. Welcome, great Calymath!

     FERNEZE. How the slave jeers at him!
          [Aside.]

     BARABAS. Will't please thee, mighty Selim Calymath,
     To ascend our homely stairs?

     CALYMATH. Ay, Barabas.--
     Come, bassoes, ascend. [204]

     FERNEZE. [coming forward] Stay, Calymath;
     For I will shew thee greater courtesy
     Than Barabas would have afforded thee.

     KNIGHT. [within] Sound a charge there!
          [A charge sounded within:  FERNEZE cuts the cord; the floor
          of the gallery gives way, and BARABAS falls into a caldron
          placed in a pit.

          Enter KNIGHTS and MARTIN DEL BOSCO. [205]

     CALYMATH. How now! what means this?

     BARABAS. Help, help me, Christians, help!

     FERNEZE. See, Calymath! this was devis'd for thee.

     CALYMATH. Treason, treason! bassoes, fly!

     FERNEZE. No, Selim, do not fly:
     See his end first, and fly then if thou canst.

     BARABAS. O, help me, Selim! help me, Christians!
     Governor, why stand you all so pitiless?

     FERNEZE. Should I in pity of thy plaints or thee,
     Accursed Barabas, base Jew, relent?
     No, thus I'll see thy treachery repaid,
     But wish thou hadst behav'd thee otherwise.

     BARABAS. You will not help me, then?

     FERNEZE. No, villain, no.

     BARABAS. And, villains, know you cannot help me now.--
     Then, Barabas, breathe forth thy latest fate,
     And in the fury of thy torments strive
     To end thy life with resolution.--
     Know, governor, 'twas I that slew thy son,--
     I fram'd the challenge that did make them meet:
     Know, Calymath, I aim'd thy overthrow:
     And, had I but escap'd this stratagem,
     I would have brought confusion on you all,
     Damn'd Christian [206] dogs, and Turkish infidels!
     But now begins the extremity of heat
     To pinch me with intolerable pangs:
     Die, life! fly, soul! tongue, curse thy fill, and die!
          [Dies.]

     CALYMATH. Tell me, you Christians, what doth this portend?

     FERNEZE. This train [207] he laid to have entrapp'd thy life;
     Now, Selim, note the unhallow'd deeds of Jews;
     Thus he determin'd to have handled thee,
     But I have rather chose to save thy life.

     CALYMATH. Was this the banquet he prepar'd for us?
     Let's hence, lest further mischief be pretended. [208]

     FERNEZE. Nay, Selim, stay; for, since we have thee here,
     We will not let thee part so suddenly:
     Besides, if we should let thee go, all's one,
     For with thy galleys couldst thou not get hence,
     Without fresh men to rig and furnish them.

     CALYMATH. Tush, governor, take thou no care for that;
     My men are all aboard,
     And do attend my coming there by this.

     FERNEZE. Why, heard'st thou not the trumpet sound a charge?

     CALYMATH. Yes, what of that?

     FERNEZE. Why, then the house was fir'd,
     Blown up, and all thy soldiers massacred.

     CALYMATH. O, monstrous treason!

     FERNEZE. A Jew's courtesy;
     For he that did by treason work our fall,
     By treason hath deliver'd thee to us:
     Know, therefore, till thy father hath made good
     The ruins done to Malta and to us,
     Thou canst not part; for Malta shall be freed,
     Or Selim ne'er return to Ottoman.

     CALYMATH. Nay, rather, Christians, let me go to Turkey,
     In person there to mediate [209] your peace:
     To keep me here will naught advantage you.

     FERNEZE. Content thee, Calymath, here thou must stay,
     And live in Malta prisoner; for come all [210] the world
     To rescue thee, so will we guard us now,
     As sooner shall they drink the ocean dry,
     Than conquer Malta, or endanger us.
     So, march away; and let due praise be given
     Neither to Fate nor Fortune, but to Heaven.
          [Exeunt.]

passage happens to be mispointed in the old ed. thus,

and hence Mr. Collier, in his HIST. OF ENG. DRAM. POET. iii.
114, understood the words,

    "in Tamburlaine,
     This Jew, with others many,"

as applying to Marlowe:  he afterwards, however, in his MEMOIRS
OF ALLEYN, p. 9, suspected that the punctuation of the old ed.

[Footnote 8: him: "Perkins."  Marg. note in old ed.--"This was Richard
Perkins, one of the performers belonging to the Cock-pit theatre
in Drury-Lane.  His name is printed among those who acted in
HANNIBAL AND SCIPIO by Nabbes, THE WEDDING by Shirley, and
THE FAIR MAID OF THE WEST by Heywood.  After the play-houses
were shut up on account of the confusion arising from the civil
wars, Perkins and Sumner, who belonged to the same house, lived
together at Clerkenwell, where they died and were buried.  They
both died some years before the Restoration.  See THE DIALOGUE
ON PLAYS AND PLAYERS [Dodsley's OLD PLAYS, 1. clii., last ed.]."
REED (apud Dodsley's O. P.).  Perkins acted a prominent part in
Webster's WHITE DEVIL, when it was first brought on the stage,
--perhaps Brachiano (for Burbadge, who was celebrated in
Brachiano, does not appear to have played it originally):  in a
notice to the reader at the end of that tragedy Webster says;
"In particular I must remember the well-approved industry of my
friend Master Perkins, and confess the worth of his action did
crown both the beginning and end."  About 1622-3 Perkins belonged
to the Red Bull theatre:  about 1637 he joined the company at
Salisbury Court:  see Webster's WORKS, note, p. 51, ed. Dyce,
1857.]

     Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
     Sound ONE into the drowsy ear of NIGHT," &c.]

[Footnote 142: Enter FRIAR JACOMO: The scene is now before Barabas's
house,--the audience having had to SUPPOSE that the body of
Barnardine, which Ithamore had set upright, was standing
outside the door.]

[Footnote 143: proceed: Seems to be used here as equivalent to--succeed.]

[Footnote 144: on's: i.e. of his.]

[Footnote 145: Enter BELLAMIRA, &c.: The scene, as in p. 160, a veranda
or open portico of Bellamira's house.

    "     Enter BELLAMIRA. (91)

[Footnote 146: tall: Which our early dramatists generally use in the

our early writers.  So Taylor in some verses on Coriat;

    "I'le make him send me half he has, & glad he scapes so too.
     PEN AND INKE:
     I'll write vnto him, we'le haue mony strait."

There can be no doubt that the words "Pen and inke" were a
direction to the property-man to have those articles on the
stage.]

[Footnote 154: cunning: i.e. skilfully prepared.--Old ed. "running."
(The MAIDS are supposed to hear their mistress' orders WITHIN.)]

[Footnote 155: Shalt live with me, and be my love: A line, slightly
varied, of Marlowe's well-known song.  In the preceding line,
the absurdity of "by Dis ABOVE" is, of course, intentional.]

[Footnote 156: beard: Old ed. "sterd."]

[Footnote 157: give me a ream of paper:  we'll have a kingdom of gold
for't: A quibble.  REALM was frequently written ream;  and
frequently (as the following passages shew), even when the
former spelling was given, the L was not sounded;

    "Vpon the siluer bosome of the STREAME
     First gan faire Themis shake her amber locks,
     Whom all the Nimphs that waight on Neptunes REALME
     Attended from the hollowe of the rocks."
          Lodge's SCILLAES METAMORPHOSIS, &c. 1589, Sig. A 2.

    "How he may surest stablish his new conquerd REALME,
     How of his glorie fardest to deriue the STREAME."
          A HERINGS TAYLE, &c. 1598, Sig. D 3.

    "Learchus slew his brother for the crowne;
     So did Cambyses fearing much the DREAME;
     Antiochus, of infamous renowne,
     His brother slew, to rule alone the REALME."
          MIROUR FOR MAGISTRATES, p. 78, ed. 1610.]

[Footnote 158: runs division: "A musical term [of very common
occurrence]."  STEEVENS (apud Dodsley's O. P.).]

[Footnote 159: Enter BARABAS: The scene certainly seems to be now the
interior of Barabas's house, notwithstanding what he presently
says to Pilia-Borza (p. 171, sec. col.), "Pray, when, sir, shall
I see you at my house?"]

[Footnote 160: tatter'd: Old ed. "totter'd":  but in a passage of our
author's EDWARD THE SECOND the two earliest 4tos have "TATTER'D
robes":--and yet Reed in a note on that passage (apud Dodsley's
OLD PLAYS, where the reading of the third 4to, "tottered robes",
is followed) boldly declares that "in every writer of this
period the word was spelt TOTTERED"! The truth is, it was spelt
sometimes one way, sometimes the other.]

[Footnote 161: catzery: i.e. cheating, roguery.  It is formed from CATSO
(CAZZO, see note *, p. 166  i.e. note 127), which our early
writers used, not only as an exclamation, but as an opprobrious
term.]

[Footnote 162: cross-biting: i.e. swindling (a cant term).--Something has
dropt out here.]

[Footnote 163: tale: i.e. reckoning.]

[Footnote 164: what he writes for you: i.e. the hundred crowns to be
given to the bearer:  see p. 170, sec. col.

     p. 170, second column, this play:

    "ITHAMORE. [writing: SIRRAH JEW, AS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE,
     SEND ME FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS, AND GIVE THE BEARER A HUNDRED.
     --Tell him I must have't."]

[Footnote 165: I should part: Qy. "I E'ER should part"?]

[Footnote 166: rid: i.e. despatch, destroy.]

[Footnote 167: Enter BELLAMIRA, &c.: They are supposed to be sitting in
a veranda or open portico of Bellamira's house:  see note *,
p. 168. [i.e. note 145.]

[Footnote 168: Of: i.e. on.]

[Footnote 169: BELLAMIRA.: Old ed. "Pil."]

[Footnote 170: Rivo Castiliano: The origin of this Bacchanalian
exclamation has not been discovered.  RIVO generally is used
alone; but, among passages parallel to that of our text, is
the following one (which has been often cited),--

    "And RYUO will he cry and CASTILE too."
          LOOKE ABOUT YOU, 1600, Sig. L. 4.

A writer in THE WESTMINSTER REVIEW, vol. xliii. 53, thinks that
it "is a misprint for RICO-CASTELLANO, meaning a Spaniard
belonging to the class of RICOS HOMBRES, and the phrase
therefore is--

    'Hey, NOBLE CASTILIAN, a man's a man!'
'I can pledge like a man and drink like a man, MY WORTHY TROJAN;'
as some of our farce-writers would say." But the frequent
occurrence of RIVO in various authors proves that it is NOT
a misprint.]

[Footnote 171: he: Old ed. "you".]

[Footnote 172: and he and I, snicle hand too fast, strangled a friar]
There is surely some corruption here.  Steevens (apud Dodsley's
O. P.) proposes to read "hand TO FIST".  Gilchrist (ibid.)
observes, "a snicle is a north-country word for a noose, and
when a person is hanged, they say he is snicled."  See too,
in V. SNICKLE, Forby's VOC. OF EAST ANGLIA, and the CRAVEN
DIALECT.--The Rev. J. Mitford proposes the following (very
violent) alteration of this passage;

    "Itha. I carried the broth that poisoned the nuns; and he
   and I--
     Pilia. Two hands snickle-fast--
     Itha. Strangled a friar."]

[Footnote 173: incony: i.e. fine, pretty, delicate.--Old ed. "incoomy."]

[Footnote 174: they stink like a hollyhock: "This flower, however, has
no offensive smell.  STEEVENS (apud Dodsley's O. P.).  Its
odour resembles that of the poppy.]

[Footnote 175: mushrooms: For this word (as, indeed, for most words) our
early writers had no fixed spelling.  Here the old ed. has
"Mushrumbs":  and in our author's EDWARD THE SECOND, the 4tos
have "mushrump."]

[Footnote 176: under the elder when he hanged himself: That Judas hanged
himself on an elder-tree, was a popular legend.  Nay, the very
tree was exhibited to the curious in Sir John Mandeville's days:
"And faste by, is zit the Tree of Eldre, that Judas henge him
self upon, for despeyt that he hadde, whan he solde and betrayed
oure Lorde."  VOIAGE AND TRAVAILE, &c. p. 112. ed. 1725.  But,
according to Pulci, Judas had recourse to a carob-tree:

    "Era di sopra a la fonte UN CARRUBBIO,
     L'ARBOR, SI DICE, OVE S'IMPICCO GIUDA," &c.

SQUARE BRACKETS:
The square brackets, i.e. [ ] are copied from the printed book,
without change, except that the stage directions usually do not
have closing brackets.  These have been added.

FOOTNOTES:
For this E-Text version of the book, the footnotes have been
consolidated at the end of the play.

Numbering of the footnotes has been changed, and each footnote
is given a unique identity in the form  [XXX].


CHANGES TO THE TEXT:
Character names were expanded.  For Example, BARABAS was BARA.,
FERNEZE was FERN., etc.

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

[Scene i]


        Enter Charles the French King, [Catherine] the Queene Mother,
        the King of Navarre, the Prince of Condye, the Lord high
        Admirall, and [Margaret] the Queene of Navarre, with others.

   CHARLES. Prince of Navarre my honourable brother,
   Prince Condy, and my good Lord Admirall,
   wishe this union and religious league,
   Knit in these hands, thus joyn'd in nuptiall rites,
   May not desolve, till death desolve our lives,
   And that the native sparkes of princely love,
   That kindled first this motion in our hearts,
   May still be feweld in our progenye.

   NAVAREE. The many favours which your grace has showne,
   From time to time, but specially in this,
   Shall binde me ever to your highnes will,
   In what Queen Mother or your grace commands.

   QUEENE MOTHER. Thanks sonne Navarre, you see we love you well,
   That linke you in mariage with our daughter heer:
   And as you know, our difference in Religion
   Might be a meanes to crosse you in your love.

   CHARLES. Well Madam, let that rest:
   And now my Lords the mariage rites perfourm'd,
   We think it good to goe and consumate
   The rest, with hearing of an holy Masse:
   Sister, I think your selfe will beare us company.

   QUEENE MARGARET. I will my good Lord.

   CHARLES. The rest that will not goe (my Lords) may stay:
   Come Mother,
   Let us goe to honor this solemnitie.

   QUEENE MOTHER. Which Ile desolve with bloud and crueltie.

       [Aside.]

        Exit [Charles] the King, Queene Mother, and [Margaret]
        the Queene of Navar [with others], and manet Navar,
        the Prince of Condy, and the Lord high Admirall.

   NAVARRE. Prince Condy and my good Lord Admiral,
   Now Guise may storme but does us little hurt:
   Having the King, Queene Mother on our side,
   To stop the mallice of his envious heart,
   That seekes to murder all the Protestants:
   Have you not heard of late how he decreed,
   If that the King had given consent thereto,
   That all the protestants that are in Paris,
   Should have been murdered the other night?

   ADMIRALL. My Lord I mervaile that th'aspiring Guise
   Dares once adventure without the Kings assent,
   To meddle or attempt such dangerous things.

   CONDY. My Lord you need not mervaile at the Guise,
   For what he doth the Pope will ratifie:
   In murder, mischeefe, or in tiranny.

   NAVARRE. But he that sits and rules above the clowdes,
   Doth heare and see the praiers of the just:
   And will revenge the bloud of innocents,
   That Guise hath slaine by treason of his heart,
   And brought by murder to their timeles ends.

   ADMIRALL. My Lord, but did you mark the Cardinall
   The Guises brother, and the Duke Dumain:
   How they did storme at these your nuptiall rites,
   Because the house of Burbon now comes in,
   And joynes your lineage to the crowne of France?

   NAVARRE. And thats the cause that Guise so frowns at us,
   And beates his braines to catch us in his trap,
   Which he hath pitcht within his deadly toyle.
   Come my Lords lets go to the Church and pray,
   That God may still defend the right of France:
   And make his Gospel flourish in this land.

        Exeunt.





[Scene ii]


        Enter the Duke of Guise.

   GUISE. If ever Hymen lowr'd at marriage rites,
   And had his alters decks with duskie lightes:
   If ever sunne stainde heaven with bloudy clowdes,
   And made it look with terrour on the worlde:
   If ever day were turnde to ugly night,
   And night made semblance of the hue of hell,
   This day, this houre, this fatall night,
   Shall fully shew the fury of them all.
   Apothecarie.--

        Enter the Pothecarie.

   POTHECARIE. My Lord.

   GUISE. Now shall I prove and guerdon to the ful,
   The love thou bear'st unto the house of Guise:
   Where are those perfumed gloves which late I sent
   To be poysoned, hast thou done them? speake,
   Will every savour breed a pangue of death?

   POTHECARIE. See where they be my Lord, and he that smelles
   but to them, dyes.

   GUISE. Then thou remainest resolute.

   POTHECARIE. I am my Lord, in what your grace commaundes till death.

   GUISE. Thankes my good freend, I wil requite thy love.
   Goe then, present them to the Queene Navarre:
   For she is that huge blemish in our eye,
   That makes these upstart heresies in Fraunce:
   Be gone my freend, present them to her straite.
   Souldyer.--

        Exit Pothecaier.

        Enter a Souldier.

   SOULDIER. My Lord.

   GUISE. Now come thou forth and play thy tragick part,
   Stand in some window opening neere the street,
   And when thou seest the Admirall ride by,
   Discharge thy musket and perfourme his death:
   And then Ile guerdon thee with store of crownes.

   SOULDIER. I will my Lord.

        Exit Souldier.

   GUISE. Now Guise, begin those deepe ingendred thoughts
   To burst abroad, those never dying flames,
   Which cannot be extinguisht but by bloud.
   Oft have I leveld, and at last have learnd,
   That perill is the cheefest way to happines,
   And resolution honors fairest aime.
   What glory is there in a common good,
   That hanges for every peasant to atchive?
   That like I best that flyes beyond my reach.
   Set me to scale the high Peramides,
   And thereon set the Diadem of Fraunce,
   Ile either rend it with my nayles to naught,
   Or mount the top with my aspiring winges,
   Although my downfall be the deepest hell.
   For this, I wake, when others think I sleepe,
   For this, I waite, that scorn attendance else:
   For this, my quenchles thirst whereon I builde,
   Hath often pleaded kindred to the King.
   For this, this head, this heart, this hand and sworde,
   Contrive, imagine and fully execute
   Matters of importe, aimed at by many,
   Yet understoode by none.
   For this, hath heaven engendred me of earth,
   For this, the earth sustaines my bodies weight,
   And with this wait Ile counterpoise a Crowne,
   Or with seditions weary all the worlde:
   For this, from Spaine the stately Catholic
   Sends Indian golde to coyne me French ecues:
   For this have I a largesse from the Pope,
   A pension and a dispensation too:
   And by that priviledge to worke upon,
   My policye hath framde religion.
   Religion: O Diabole.
   Fye, I am ashamde, how ever that I seeme,
   To think a word of such a simple sound,
   Of so great matter should be made the ground.
   The gentle King whose pleasure uncontrolde,
   Weakneth his body, and will waste his Realme,
   If I repaire not what he ruinates:
   Him as a childe I dayly winne with words,
   So that for proofe, he barely beares the name:
   I execute, and he sustaines the blame.
   The Mother Queene workes wonders for my sake,
   And in my love entombes the hope of Fraunce:
   Rifling the bowels of her treasurie,
   To supply my wants and necessitie.
   Paris hath full five hundred Colledges,
   As Monestaries, Priories, Abbyes and halles,
   Wherein are thirtie thousand able men,
   Besides a thousand sturdy student Catholicks,
   And more: of my knowledge in one cloyster keep,
   Five hundred fatte Franciscan Fryers and priestes.
   All this and more, if more may be comprisde,
   To bring the will of our desires to end.
   Then Guise,
   Since thou hast all the Cardes within thy hands
   To shuffle or to cut, take this as surest thing:
   That right or wrong, thou deal'st thy selfe a King.
   I but, Navarre. Tis but a nook of France.
   Sufficient yet for such a pettie King:
   That with a rablement of his hereticks,
   Blindes Europs eyes and troubleth our estate:
   Him will we--

        Pointing to his Sworde.

   But first lets follow those in France.
   That hinder our possession to the crowne:
   As Caesar to his souldiers, so say I:
   Those that hate me, will I learn to loath.
   Give me a look, that when I bend the browes,
   Pale death may walke in furrowes of my face:
   A hand, that with a graspe may gripe the world,
   An eare, to heare what my detractors say,
   A royall seate, a scepter and a crowne:
   That those which doe behold them may become
   As men that stand and gase against the Sunne.
   The plot is laide, and things shall come to passe,
   Where resolution strives for victory.

        Exit.





[Scene iii]


        Enter the King of Navar and Queen [Margaret], and his [olde]
        Mother Queen [of Navarre], the Prince of Condy, the Admirall,
        and the Pothecary with the gloves, and gives them to the olde
        Queene.

   POTHECARIE. Maddame, I beseech your grace to except this simple gift.

   OLD QUEENE. Thanks my good freend, holde, take thou this reward.

   POTHECARIE. I humbly thank your Majestie.

        Exit Pothecary.

   OLD QUEENE. Me thinkes the gloves have a very strong perfume,
   The sent whereof doth make my head to ake.

   NAVARRE. Doth not your grace know the man that gave them you?

   OLD QUEENE. Not wel, but do remember such a man.

   ADMIRALL. Your grace was ill advisde to take them then,
   Considering of these dangerous times.

   OLD QUEENE. Help sonne Navarre, I am poysoned.

   QUEENE MARGARET. The heavens forbid your highnes such mishap.

   NAVARRE. The late suspition of the Duke of Guise,
   Might well have moved your highnes to beware
   How you did meddle with such dangerous giftes.

   QUEENE MARGARET. Too late it is my Lord if that be true
   To blame her highnes, but I hope it be
   Only some naturall passion makes her sicke.

   OLD QUEENE. O no, sweet Margaret, the fatall poyson
   Doth work within my heart, my brain pan breakes,
   My heart doth faint, I dye.

        She dyes.

   NAVARRE. My Mother poysoned heere before my face:
   O gracious God, what times are these?
   O graunt sweet God my daies may end with hers,
   That I with her may dye and live againe.

   QUEENE MARGARET. Let not this heavy chaunce my dearest Lord,
   (For whose effects my soule is massacred)
   Infect thy gracious brest with fresh supply,
   To agravate our sodaine miserie.

   ADMIRALL. Come my Lords let us beare her body hence,
   And see it honoured with just solemnitie.

        As they are going, [enter] the Souldier [above, who] dischargeth
        his musket at the Lord Admirall [and exit].

   CONDY. What are you hurt my Lord high Admiral?

   ADMIRALL. I my good Lord, shot through the arme.

   NAVARRE. We are betraide, come my Lords, and let us goe tell
   the King of this.

   ADMIRALL. These are the cursed Guisians that doe seeke our death.
   Oh fatall was this mariage to us all.

        They beare away the [olde] Queene [of Navarre] and goe out.





[Scene iv]


        Enter [Charles] the King, [Catherine] the Queene Mother, Duke of Guise,
        Duke Anjou, Duke Demayne [and Cossin, Captain of the Kings Guard].

   QUEENE MOTHER. My noble sonne, and princely Duke of Guise,
   Now have we got the fatall stragling deere,
   Within the compasse of a deadly toyle,
   And as we late decreed we may perfourme.

   CHARLES. Madam, it wilbe noted through the world,
   An action bloudy and tirannicall:
   Cheefely since under safetie of our word,
   They justly challenge their protection:
   Besides my heart relentes that noble men,
   Onely corrupted in religion,
   Ladies of honor, Knightes and Gentlemen,
   Should for their conscience taste such rutheles ends.

   ANJOY. Though gentle minces should pittie others paines,
   Yet will the wisest note their proper greefes:
   And rather seeke to scourge their enemies,
   Then be themselves base subjects to the whip.

   GUISE. Me thinkes my Lord, Anjoy hath well advisde
   Your highnes to consider of the thing,
   And rather chuse to seek your countries good,
   Then pittie or releeve these upstart hereticks.

   QUEENE MOTHER. I hope these reasons mayserve my princely, Sonne,
   To have some care for feare of enemies.

   CHARLES. Well Madam, I referre it to your Majestie,
   And to my Nephew heere the Duke of Guise:
   What you determine, I will ratifie.

   QUEENE MOTHER. Thankes to my princely sonne, then tell me Guise,
   What order wil you set downe for the Massacre?

   GUISE. Thus Madame.
   They that shalbe actors in this Massacre,
   Shall weare white crosses on their Burgonets,
   And tye white linnen scarfes about their armes.
   He that wantes these, and is suspect of heresie,
   Shall dye, or be he King or Emperour.
   Then Ile have a peale of ordinance shot from the tower,
   At which they all shall issue out and set the streetes.
   And then the watchword being given, a bell shall ring,
   Which when they heare, they shall begin to kill:
   And never cease untill that bell shall cease,
   Then breath a while.

        Enter the Admirals man.

   CHARLES. How now fellow, what newes?

   MAN. And it please your grace the Lord high Admirall,
   Riding the streetes was traiterously shot,
   And most humbly intreates your Majestie
   To visite him sick in his bed.

   CHARLES. Messenger, tell him I will see him straite.

        Exit Messenger.

   What shall we doe now with the Admirall?

   QUEENE MOTHER. Your Majesty had best goe visite him,
   And make a shew as if all were well.

   CHARLES. Content, I will goe visite the Admirall.

   GUISE. And I will goe take order for his death.

        Exit Guise.

        Enter the Admirall in his bed.

   CHARLES. How fares it with my Lord high Admiral,
   Hath he been hurt with villaines in the street?
   I vow and sweare as I am King of France,
   To finde and to repay the man with death:
   With death delay'd and torments never usde,
   That durst presume for hope of any gaine,
   To hurt the noble man his sovereign loves.

   ADMIRALL. Ah my good Lord, these are the Guisians,
   That seeke to massacre our guiltles lives.

   CHARLES. Assure your selfe my good Lord Admirall,
   I deepely sorrow for your trecherous wrong:
   And that I am not more secure my selfe,
   Then I am carefull you should be preserved.
   Cossin, take twenty of our strongest guarde,
   And under your direction see they keep
   All trecherous violence from our noble freend,
   Repaying all attempts with present death,
   Upon the cursed breakers of our peace.
   And so be pacient good Lord Admirall,
   And every hower I will visite you.

          Exeunt omnes.






[Scene v]


        Enter Guise, Anjoy, Dumaine, Gonzago, Retes, Montsorrell, and
        Souldiers to the massacre.

   GUISE. Anjoy, Dumaine, Gonzago, Retes, sweare by
   The argent crosses on your burgonets,
   To kill all that you suspect of heresie.

   DUMAINE. I sweare by this to be unmercifull.

   ANJOY. I am disguisde and none nows who I am,
   And therfore meane to murder all I meet.

   GONZAGO. And so will I.

   RETES. And I.

   GUISE. Away then, break into the Admirals house.

   GETES. I let the Admirall be first dispatcht.

   GUISE. The Admirall,
   Cheefe standard bearer to the Lutheranes,
   Shall in the entrance of this Massacre,
   Be murdered in his bed.
   Gonzago conduct them hither, and then
   Beset his house that not a man may live.

   ANJOY. That charge is mine. Swizers keepe you the streetes,
   And at ech corner shall the Kings garde stand.

   GONZAGO. Come sirs follow me.

        Exit Gonzago and others with him.

   ANJOY. Cossin, the Captaine of the Admirals guarde,
   Plac'd by my brother, will betray his Lord:
   Now Guise shall catholiques flourish once againe,
   The head being of, the members cannot stand.

   RETES. But look my Lord, ther's some in the Admirals house.

        Enter [above Gonzago and others] into the Admirals house,
        and he in his bed.

   ANJOY. In lucky time, come let us keep this lane,
   And slay his servants that shall issue out.

   GONZAGO. Where is the Admirall?

   ADMIRALL. O let me pray before I dye.

   GONZAGO. Then pray unto our Ladye, kisse this crosse.

        Stab him.

   ADMIRALL. O God forgive my sins.

   GUISE. What, is he dead Gonzago?

   GONZAGO. I my Lord.

   GUISE. Then throw him down.

        [The body is thrown down. Exeunt Gonzago and rest above.]

   ANJOY. Now cosin view him well,
   It may be it is some other, and he escapte.

   GUISE. Cosin tis he, I know him by his look.
   See where my Souldier shot him through the arm.
   He mist him neer, but we have strook him now.
   Ah base Shatillian and degenerate,
   Cheef standard bearer to the Lutheranes,
   Thus in despite of thy Religion,
   The Duke of Guise stampes on thy liveles bulke.

   Away with him, cut of his head and handes,
   And send them for a present to the Pope:
   And when this just revenge is finished,
   Unto mount Faucon will we dragge his coarse:
   And he that living hated so the crosse,
   Shall being dead, be hangd thereon in chaines.

   GUISE. Anjoy, Gonzago, Retes, if that you three,
   Will be as resolute as I and Dumaine:
   There shall not a Hugonet breath in France.

   ANJOY. I sweare by this crosse, wee'l not be partiall,
   But slay as many as we can come neer.

   GUISE. Mountsorrett, go and shoote the ordinance of,
   That they which have already set the street
   May know their watchword, and then tole the bell,
   And so lets forward to the Massacre.

   MOUNTSORRELL. I will my Lord.

        Exit Mountsorrell.

   GUISE. And now my Lords let us closely to our busines.

   ANJOY. Anjoy will follow thee.

   DUMAINE. And so will Dumaine.

        The ordinance being shot of, the bell tolles.

   GUISE. Come then, lets away.

        Exeunt.

        The Guise enters againe, with all the rest, with their Swords drawne,
        chasing the Protestants.

   GUISE. Tue, tue, tue,
   Let none escape, murder the Hugonets.

   ANJOY. Kill them, kill them.

        Exeunt.

        Enter Loreine running, the Guise and the rest pursuing him.

   GUISE. Loreine, Loreine, follow Loreine.. Sirra,
   Are you a preacher of these heresies?

   LOREINE. I am a preacher of the word of God,
   And thou a traitor to thy soule and him.

   GUISE. Dearely beloved brother, thus tis written.

        He stabs him.

   ANJOY. Stay my Lord, let me begin the psalme.

   GUISE. Come dragge him away and throw him in a ditch.

        Exeunt [omnes].





[Scene vi]


        Enter Mountsorrell and knocks at Serouns doore.

   SEROUNS WIFE. Who is't that knocks there?

        [Within.]

   MOUNTSORRELL. Mountsorrett from the Duke of Guise.

   SEROUNS WIFE. Husband come down, heer's one would speak with
   you from the Duke of Guise.

        Enter Seroune.

   SEROUNE. To speek with me from such a man as he?

   MOUNTSORRELL. I, I, for this Seroune, and thou shalt ha't.

        Shewing his dagger.

   SEROUNE. O let me pray before I take my death.

   MOUNTSORRELL. Despatch then quickly.

   SEROUNE. O Christ my Saviour--

   MOUNTSORRELL. Christ, villaine?
   Why, darst thou presume to call on Christ,
   Without the intercession of some Saint?
   Sanctus Jacobus hee was my Saint, pray to him.

   SEROUNE. O let me pray unto my God.

   MOUNTSORRELL. Then take this with you.

        Stab him [and he falls within and dies].

        Exit.





[Scene vii]


        Enter Ramus in his studie.

   RAMUS. What fearfull cries come from the river Sene,
   That fright poore Ramus sitting at his book?
   I feare the Guisians have past the bridge,
   And meane once more to menace me.

        Enter Taleus.

   TALEUS. Flye Ramus flye, if thou wilt save thy life.

   RAMUS. Tell me Taleus, wherfore should I flye?

   TALEUS. The Guisians are hard at thy doore,
   And meane to murder us:
   Harke, harke they come, Ile leap out at the window.

        [Runs out from studie.]

   RAMUS. Sweet Taleus stay.

        Enter Gonzago and Retes.

   GONZAGO. Who goes there?

   RETES. Tis Taleus, Ramus bedfellow.

   GONZAGO. What art thou?

   TALEUS. I am as Ramus is, a Christian.

   RETES. O let him goe, he is a catholick.

        Exit Taleus.

        Enter Ramus [out of his studie].

   GONZAGO. Come Ramus, more golde, or thou shalt have the stabbe.

   RAMUS. Alas I am a scholler, how should I have golde?
   All that I have is but my stipend from the King,
   Which is no sooner receiv'd but it is spent.

        Enter the Guise and Anjoy [, Dumaine, Mountsorrell,
        with soldiers].

   ANJOY. Whom have you there?

   RETES. Tis Ramus, the Kings professor of Logick.

   GUISE. Stab him.

   RAMUS. O good my Lord,
   Wherein hath Ramus been so offencious?

   GUISE. Marry sir, in having a smack in all,
   And yet didst never sound any thing to the depth.
   Was it not thou that scoff'dst the Organon,
   And said it was a heape of vanities?
   He that will be a flat decotamest,
   And seen in nothing but Epitomies:
   Is in your judgment thought a learned man.
   And he forsooth must goe and preach in Germany:
   Excepting against Doctors actions,
   And ipse dixi with this quidditie,
   Argumentum testimonis est in arte partialis.
   To contradict which, I say Ramus shall dye:
   How answere you that? your nego argumentum
   Cannot serve, Sirrah, kill him.

   RAMUS. O good my Lord, let me but speak a word.

   ANJOY. Well, say on.

   RAMUS. Not for my life doe I desire this pause,
   But in my latter houre to purge my selfe,
   In that I know the things that I have wrote,
   Which as I heare one Shekins takes it ill,
   Because my places being but three, contain all his:
   I knew the Organon to be confusde,
   And I reduc'd it into better forme.
   And this for Aristotle will I say,
   That he that despiseth him, can nere
   Be good in Logick or Philosophie.
   And thats because the blockish Sorbonests
   Attribute as much unto their workes,
   As to the service of the eternall God.

   GUISE. Why suffer you that peasant to declaime?
   Stab him I say and send him to his freends in hell.

   ANJOY. Nere was there Colliars sonne so full of pride.

        Kill him. [Close the studie.]

   GUISE. My Lord Anjoy, there are a hundred Protestants,
   Which we have chaste into the river Sene,
   That swim about and so preserve their lives:
   How may we doe? I feare me they will live.

   DUMAINE. Goe place some men upon the bridge,
   With bowes and cartes to shoot at them they see,
   And sinke them in the river as they swim.

   GUISE. Tis well advisde Dumain, goe see it done.

        Exit Dumaine.

   And in the mean time my Lord, could we devise,
   To get those pedantes from the King Navarre,
   That are tutors to him and the prince of Condy--

   ANJOY. For that let me alone, Cousin stay heer,
   And when you see me in, then follow hard.

        He knocketh, and enter the King of Navarre and Prince
        of Condy, with their scholmaisters.

   How now my Lords, how fare you?

   NAVARRE. My Lord, they say
   That all the protestants are massacred.

   ANJOY. I, so they are, but yet what remedy:
   I have done all I could to stay this broile.

   NAVARRE. But yet my Lord the report doth run,
   That you were one that made this Massacre.

   ANJOY. Who I? you are deceived, I rose but now

        Enter [to them] Guise.

   GUISE. Murder the Hugonets, take those pedantes hence.

   NAVARRE. Thou traitor Guise, lay of thy bloudy hands.

   CONDY. Come let us goe tell the King.

        Exeunt [Condy and Navarre].

   GUISE. Come sirs, Ile whip you to death with my punniards point.

        He kils them.

   ANJOY. Away with them both.

        Exit Anjoy [and soldiers with bodies].

   GUISE. And now sirs for this night let our fury stay.
   Yet will we not the Massacre shall end:
   Gonzago posse you to Orleance, Retes to Deep,
   Mountsorrell unto Roan, and spare not one
   That you suspect of heresy. And now stay
   That bel that to the devils mattins rings.
   Now every man put of his burgonet,
   And so convey him closely to his bed.

        Exeunt.





[Scene viii]


        Enter Anjoy, with two Lords of Poland.

   ANJOY. My Lords of Poland I must needs confesse,
   The offer of your Prince Elector's, farre
   Beyond the reach of my desertes:
   For Poland is as I have been enformde,
   A martiall people, worthy such a King,
   As hath sufficient counsaile in himselfe,
   To lighten doubts and frustrate subtile foes.
   And such a King whom practice long hath taught,
   To please himselfe with mannage of the warres,
   The greatest warres within our Christian bounds,
   I meane our warres against the Muscovites:
   And on the other side against the Turke,
   Rich Princes both, and mighty Emperours:
   Yet by my brother Charles our King of France,
   And by his graces councell it is thought,
   That if I undertake to weare the crowne
   Of Poland, it may prejudice their hope
   Of my inheritance to the crowne of France:
   For if th'almighty take my brother hence,
   By due discent the Regall seat is mine.
   With Poland therfore must I covenant thus,
   That if by death of Charles, the diadem
   Of France be cast on me, then with your leaves
   I may retire me to my native home.
   If your commission serve to warrant this,
   I thankfully shall undertake the charge
   Of you and yours, and carefully maintaine
   The wealth and safety of your kingdomes right.

   LORD. All this and more your highnes shall commaund,
   For Polands crowne and kingly diadem.

   ANJOY. Then come my Lords, lets goe.

        Exeunt.






[Scene ix]



        Enter two with the Admirals body.

   1. Now sirra, what shall we doe with the Admirall?

   2. Why let us burne him for a heretick.

   1. O no, his bodye will infect the fire, and the fire the aire, and
   so we shall be poysoned with him.

   2. What shall we doe then?

   1. Lets throw him into the river.

   2. Oh twill corrupt the water, and the water the fish, and the
   fish our selves when we eate them.

   1. Then throw him into the ditch.

   2. No, no, to decide all doubts, be rulde by me, lets hang him
   upon this tree.

   1. Agreede.

        They hang him.

        Enter the Duke of Guise, and Queene Mother, and the
        Cardinall [of Loraine].

   GUISE. Now Madame, how like you our lusty Admirall?

   QUEENE MOTHER. Beleeve me Guise he becomes the place so well,
   That I could long ere this have wisht him there.
   But come lets walke aside, th'airs not very sweet.

   GUISE. No by my faith Madam.
   Sirs, take him away and throw him in some ditch.

        Carry away the dead body.

   And now Madam as I understand,
   There anre a hundred Hugonets and more,
   Which in the woods doe horde their synagogue:
   And dayly meet about this time of day,
   thither will I to put them to the sword.

   QUEENE MOTHER. Doe so sweet Guise, let us delay no time,
   For if these straglers gather head againe,
   And disperse themselves throughout the Realme of France,
   It will be hard for us to worke their deaths.

   GUISE. Madam,
   I goe as whirl-winces rage before a storme.

        Exit Guise.

   QUEENE MOTHER. My Lord of Loraine have you marks of late,
   How Charles our sonne begins for to lament
   For the late nights worke which my Lord of Guise
   Did make in Paris amongst the Hugonites?

   CARDINALL. Madam, I have heard him solemnly vow,
   With the rebellious King of Navarre,
   For to revenge their deaths upon us all.

   QUEENE MOTHER. I, but my Lord, let me alone for that,
   For Katherine must have her will in France:
   As I doe live, so surely shall he dye,
   And Henry then shall weare the diadem.
   And if he grudge or crosse his Mothers will,
   Ile disinherite him and all the rest:
   For Ile rule France, but they shall weare the crowne:
   And if they storme, I then may pull them downe.
   Come my Lord let's goe.

        Exeunt.






[Scene x]


        Enter five or sixe Protestants with bookes, and kneele together.

        Enter also the Guise [and others].

   GUISE. Downe with the Hugonites, murder them.

   PROTESTANT. O Mounser de Guise, heare me but speake.

   GUISE. No villain, no that toung of thine,
   That hath blasphemde the holy Church of Rome,
   Shall drive no plaintes into the Guises eares,
   To make the justice of my heart relent:
   Tue, tue, tue, let none escape:

        Kill them.

   So, dragge them away.

        Exeunt.





[Scene xi]


        Enter [Charles] the King of France, Navar and Epernoune
        staying him: enter Queene Mother, and the Cardinall [of
        Loraine, and Pleshe].

   CHARLES. O let me stay and rest me heer a while,
   A griping paine hath ceasde upon my heart:
   A sodaine pang, the messenger of death.

   QUEENE MOTHER. O say not so, thou kill'st thy mothers heart.

   CHARLES. I must say so, paine forceth me to complain.

   NAVARRE. Comfort your selfe my Lord I have no doubt,
   But God will sure restore you to your health.

   CHARLES. O no, my loving brother of Navarre.
   I have deserv'd a scourge I must confesse,
   Yet is there pacience of another sort,
   Then to misdoe the welfare of their King:
   God graunt my neerest freends may prove no worse.
   O horde me up, my sight begins to faire,
   My sinnewes shrinke, my brain turns upside downe,
   My heart doth break, I faint and dye.

        He dies.

   QUEENE MOTHER. What art thou dead, sweet sonne? speak to thy Mother.
   O no, his soule is fled from out his breast,
   And he nor heares, nor sees us what we doe:
   My Lords, what resteth now for to be done?
   But that we presently despatch Embassadours
   To Poland, to call Henry back againe,
   To weare his brothers crowne and dignity.
   Epernoune, goe see it presently be done,
   And bid him come without delay to us.

   Epernoune  Madam, I will.

        Exit Epernoune.

   QUEENE MOTHER. And now my Lords after these funerals be done,
   We will with all the speed we can, provide
   For Henries coronation from Polonia:
   Come let us take his body hence.

        All goe out, but Navarre and Pleshe.

   NAVARRE. And now Navarre whilste that these broiles doe last,
   My opportunity may serve me fit,
   To steale from France, and hye me to my home.
   For heers no saftie in the Realme for me,
   And now that Henry is cal'd from Polland,
   It is my due by just succession:
   And therefore as speedily as I can perfourme,
   Ile muster up an army secretdy,
   For feare that Guise joyn'd with the King of Spaine,
   Might seek to crosse me in mine enterprise.
   But God that alwaies doth defend the right,
   Will shew his mercy and preserve us still.

   PLESHE. The vertues of our poor Religion,
   Cannot but march with many graces more:
   Whose army shall discomfort all your foes,
   And at the length in Pampelonia crowne,
   In spite of Spaine and all the popish power,
   That hordes it from your highnesse wrongfully:
   Your Majestie her rightfull Lord and Soveraigne.

   Navarre  Truth Pleshe, and God so prosper me in all,
   As I entend to labour for the truth,
   And true profession of his holy word:
   Come Pleshe, lets away while time doth serve.

        Exeunt.





[Scene xii]


        Sound Trumpets within, and then all crye vive le Roy two or
        three times.

        Enter Henry crowned: Queene [Mother], Cardinall [of Loraine],
        Duke of Guise, Epernoone, [Mugeroun,] the kings Minions, with
        others, and the Cutpurse.

   ALL. Vive le Roy, vive le Roy.

        Sound Trumpets.

   QUEENE MOTHER. Welcome from Poland Henry once agayne,
   Welcome to France thy fathers royall seate,
   Heere hast thou a country voice of feares,
   A warlike people to maintaine thy right,
   A watchfull Senate for ordaining lawes,
   A loving mother to preserve thy state,
   And all things that a King may wish besides:
   All this and more hath Henry with his crowne.

   CARDINALL. And long may Henry enjoy all this and more.

   ALL. Vive le Roy, vive le Roy.

        Sound trumpets.

   KING. Thanks to you al. The guider of all crownes,
   Graunt that our deeds may wel deserve your loves:
   And so they shall, if fortune speed my will,
   And yeeld our thoughts to height of my desertes.
   What say our Minions, think they Henries heart
   Will not both harbour love and Majestie?
   Put of that feare, they are already joynde,
   No person, place, or time, or circumstance,
   Shall slacke my loves affection from his bent.
   As now you are, so shall you still persist,
   Remooveles from the favours of your King.

   MUGEROUN. We know that noble minces change not their thoughts
   For wearing of a crowne: in that your grace,
   Hath worne the Poland diadem, before
   You were withvested in the crowne of France.

   KING. I tell thee Mugeroun we will be freends,
   And fellowes to, what ever stormes arise.

   MUGEROUN. Then may it please your Majestie to give me leave,
   To punish those that doe prophane this holy feast.

        He cuts of the Cutpurse eare, for cutting of the golde
        buttons off his cloake.

   KING. How meanst thou that?

   CUTPURSE. O Lord, mine eare.

   MUGEROUN. Come sir, give me my buttons and heers your eare.

   GUISE. Sirra, take him away.

   KING. Hands of good fellow, I will be his baile
   For this offence: goe sirra, worke no more,
   Till this our Coronation day be past:
   And now,
   Our rites of Coronation done,
   What now remaines, but for a while to feast,
   And spend some daies in barriers, tourny, tylte,
   And like disportes, such as doe fit the Coutr?
   Lets goe my Lords, our dinner staies for us.

        Goe out all, but the Queene [Mother] and the Cardinall.

   QUEENE MOTHER. My Lord Cardinall of Loraine, tell me,
   How likes your grace my sonnes pleasantnes?
   His mince you see runnes on his minions,
   And all his heaven is to delight himselfe:
   And whilste he sleepes securely thus in ease,
   Thy brother Guise and we may now provide,
   To plant our selves with such authoritie,
   That not a man may live without our leaves.
   Then shall the Catholick faith of Rome,
   Flourish in France, and none deny the same.

   Cardinall  Madam, as I in secresy was tolde,
   My brother Guise hath gathered a power of men,
   Which are he saith, to kill the Puritans,
   But tis the house of Burbon that he meanest
   Now Madam must you insinuate with the King,
   And tell him that tis for his Countries good,
   And common profit of Religion.

   QUEENE MOTHER. Tush man, let me alone with him,
   To work the way to bring this thing to passe:
   And if he doe deny what I doe say,
   Ile dispatch him with his brother presently.
   And then shall Mounser weare the diadem.
   Tush, all shall dye unles I have my will:
   For while she lives Katherine will be Queene.
   Come my Lord, let us goe to seek the Guise,
   And then determine of this enterprise.

        Exeunt.





[Scene xiii]


        Enter the Duchesse of Guise, and her Maide.

   DUCHESSE. Goe fetch me pen and inke.

   MAID. I will Madam.

        Exit Maid.

   DUCHESSE. That I may write unto my dearest Lord.
   Sweet Mugeroune, tis he that hath my heart,
   And Guise usurpes it, cause I am his wife:
   Faine would I finde some means to speak with him
   But cannot, and therfore am enforst to write,
   That he may come and meet me in some place,
   Where we may one injoy the others sight.

        Enter the Maid with Inke and Paper.

   So, set it down and leave me to my selfe.
   O would to God this quill that heere doth write,

        She writes.

   Had late been plucks from out faire Cupids wing:
   That it might print these lines within his heart.

        Enter the Guise.

   GUISE. What, all alone my love, and writing too:
   I prethee say to whome thou writes?

   DUCHESSE. To such a one, as when she reads my lines,
   Will laugh I feare me at their good aray.

   GUISE. I pray thee let me see.

   DUCHESSE. O no my Lord, a woman only must
   Partake the secrets of my heart.

   GUISE. But Madam I must see.

        He takes it.

   Are these your secrets that no man must know?

   DUCHESSE. O pardon me my Lord.

   GUISE. Thou trothles and unjust, what lines are these?
   Am I growne olde, or is thy lust growne yong,
   Or hath my love been so obscurde in thee,
   That others need to comment on my text?
   Is all my love forgot which helde thee deare?
   I, dearer then the apple of mine eye?
   Is Guises glory but a clowdy mist,
   In sight and judgement of thy lustfull eye?
   Mor du, were not the fruit within thy wombe,
   On whose encrease I set some longing hope:
   This wrathfull hand should strike thee to the hart
   Hence strumpet, hide thy head for shame,
   And fly my presence if thou look'st to live.

        Exit [Duchesse].

   O wicked sexe, perjured and unjust,
   Now doe I see that from the very first,
   Her eyes and lookes sow'd seeds of perjury,
   But villaine he to whom these lines should goe,
   Shall buy her love even with his dearest bloud.

        Exit.





[Scene xiv]


        Enter the King of Navarre, Pleshe and Bartus, and their train,
        with drums and trumpets.

   NAVARRE. Now Lords, since in a quarrell just and right,
   We undertake to mannage these our warres
   Against the proud disturbers of the faith,
   I meane the Guise, the Pope, and King of Spaine,
   Who set themselves to tread us under foot,
   And rend our true religion from this land:
   But for you know our quarrell is no more,
   But to defend their strange inventions,
   Which they will put us to with sword and fire:
   We must with resolute minces resolve to fight,
   In honor of our God and countries good.
   Spaine is the counsell chamber of the pope,
   Spaine is the place where he makes peace and warre,
   And Guise for Spaine hath now incenst the King,
   To send his power to meet us in the field.

   BARTUS. Then in this bloudy brunt they may beholde,
   The sole endevour of your princely care,
   To plant the true succession of the faith,
   In spite of Spaine and all his heresies.

   NAVARRE. The power of vengeance now implants it selfe,
   Upon the hauty mountains of my brest:
   Plaies with her goary coulours of revenge,
   Whom I respect as leaves of boasting greene,
   That change their coulour when the winter comes,
   When I shall vaunt as victor in revenge.

        Enter a Messenger.

   How now sirra, what newes?

   MESSENGER. My Lord, as by our scoutes we understande,
   A mighty army comes from France with speed:
   Which is already mustered in the land,
   And meanesto meet your highnes in the field.

   NAVARRE. In Gods name, let them come.
   This is the Guise that hath incenst the King,
   To leavy armes and make these civill broyles:
   But canst thou tell me who is their generall?

   MESSENGER. Not yet my Lord, for thereon doe they stay:
   But as report doth goe, the Duke of Joyeux
   Hath made great sute unto the King therfore.

   NAVARRE. It will not countervaile his paines I hope,
   I would the Guise in his steed might have come,
   But he doth lurke within his drousie couch,
   And makes his footstoole on securitie:
   So he be safe he cares not what becomes,
   Of King or Country, no not for them both.
   But come my Lords, let us away with speed,
   And place our selves in order for the fight.

        Exeunt.





[Scene xv]


        Enter [Henry] the King of France, Duke of Guise, Epernoune,
        and Duke Joyeux.

   KING. My sweet Joyeux, I make thee Generall,
   Of all my army now in readines,
   To march against the rebellious King Navarre:
   At thy request I am content thou go'st,
   Although my love to thee can hardly suffer't,
   Regarding still the danger of thy life.

   JOYEUX. Thanks to your Majestie, and so I take my leave.
   Farwell my Lord of Guise and Epernoune.

   GUISE. Health and harty farwell to my Lord Joyeux.

        Exit Joyeux.

   KING. How kindely Cosin of Guise you and your wife
   Doe both salute our lovely Minions.

        He makes hornes at the Guise.

   Remember you the letter gentle sir,
   Which your wife writ to my deare Minion,
   And her chosen freend?

   GUISE. How now my Lord, faith this is more then need,
   Am I to be thus jested at and scornde?
   Tis more then kingly or Emperious.
   And sure if all the proudest kings beside
   In Christendome, should beare me such derision,
   They should know I scornde them and their mockes.
   I love your Minions? dote on them your selfe,
   I know none els but hordes them in disgrace:
   And heer by all the Saints in heaven I sweare,
   That villain for whom I beare this deep disgrace,
   Even for your words that have incenst me so,
   Shall buy that strumpets favour with his blood,
   Whether he have dishonoured me or no.
   Par la mor du, Il mora.

        Exit.

   KING. Beleeve me, Epernoune this jest bites sore.

   EPERNOUNE. My Lord, twere good to make them frends,
   For his othes are seldome spent in vaine.

        Enter Mugeroun.

   KING. How now Mugeroun, metst thou not the Guise at the doore?

   MUGEROUN. Not I my Lord, what if I had?

   KING. Marry if thou hadst, thou mightst have had the stab,
   For he hath solemnely sworne thy death.

   MUGEROUN. I may be stabd, and live till he be dead,
   But wherfore beares he me such deadly hate?

   KING. Because his wife beares thee such kindely love.

   MUGEROUN. If that be all, the next time that I meet her,
   Ile make her shake off love with her heeles.
   But which way is he gone? Ile goe take a walk
   On purpose from the Court to meet with him.

        Exit.

   KING. I like not this, come Epernoune
   Lets goe seek the Duke and make them freends.

        Exeunt.





[Scene xvi]


        Alarums within. The Duke Joyeux slaine.

        Enter the King of Navarre [, Bartus,] and his traine.

   NAVARRE. The Duke is slaine and all his power dispearst,
   And we are grac'd with wreathes of victory:
   Thus God we see doth ever guide the right,
   To make his glory great upon the earth.

   BARTUS. The terrour of this happy victory,
   I hope will make the King surcease his hate:
   And either never mannage army more,
   Or else employ them in some better cause.

   NAVARRE. How many noble men have lost their lives,
   In prosecution of these quell armes,
   Is ruth and almost death to call to mince:
   Put God we know will alwaies put them downe,
   That lift themselves against the perfect truth,
   Which Ile maintaine as long as life doth last:
   And with the Queene of England joyne my force,
   To beat the papall Monarck from our lands,
   And keep those relicks from our countries coastes.
   Come my Lords, now that the storme is overpass,
   Let us away with triumph to our tents.

        Exeunt.





[Scene xvii]


      Enter a Souldier.

   SOULDIER. Sir, to you sir, that dare make the Duke a cuckolde,
   and use a counterfeite key to his privie Chamber doore: And
   although you take out nothing but your owne, yet you put in
   that which displeaseth him, and so forestall his market, and set up
   your standing where you should not: and whereas tree is your
   Landlord, you would take upon you to be his, and tyll the ground
   that he himself should occupy, which is his own free land. If it be
   not too free there's the question: and though I come not to take
   possession (as I would I might) yet I meane to keepe you out,
   which I will if this geare horde: what are ye come so soone?
   have at ye sir.

        Enter Mugeroun.

        He shootes at him and killes him.

        Enter the Guise [attended].

   GUISE. Holde thee tall Souldier, take thou this and flye.

        Exit Souldier.

   Lye there the Kings delight, and Guises scorne.
   Revenge it Henry as thou list'st or dar'st,
   I did it only in despite of thee.

        Take him away.

        Enter the King and Epernoune.

   KING. My Lord of Guise, we understand that you
   Have gathered a power of men.
   What your intent is yet we cannot learn,
   But we presume it is not for our good.

   GUISE. Why I am no traitor to the crowne of France.
   What I have done tis for the Gospel's sake.

   EPERNOUNE. Nay for the Popes sake, and shine owne benefite.
   What Peere in France but thou (aspiring Guise)
   Durst be in armes without the Kings consent?
   I challenge thee for treason in the cause.

   GUISE. Oh base Epernoune, were not his highnes heere,
   Thou shouldst perceive the Duke of Guise is mov'd.

   KING. Be patient Guise and threat not Epernoune,
   Least thou perceive the King of France be mov'd.

   GUISE. Why? I am a Prince of the Valoyses line,
   Therfore an enemy to the Burbonites.
   I am a juror in the holy league,
   And therfore hated of the Protestants.
   What should I doe but stand upon my guarde?
   And being able, Ile keep an hoast in pay.

   EPERNOUNE. Thou able to maintaine an hoast in pay,
   That livest by forraine exhibition?
   The Pope and King of Spaine are thy good frends,
   Else all France knowes how poor a Duke thou art.

   KING. I, those are they that feed him with their golde,
   To countermaund our will and check our freends.

   GUISE. My Lord, to speak more plainely, thus it is:
   Being animated by Religious zeale,
   I meane to muster all the power I can,
   To overthrow those factious Puritans:
   And know, the Pope will sell his triple crowne,
   I, and the catholick Philip King of Spaine,
   Ere I shall want, will cause his Indians,
   To rip the golden bowels of America.
   Navarre that cloakes them underneath his wings,
   Shall feele the house of Lorayne is his foe:
   Your highnes need not feare mine armies force,
   Tis for your safetie and your enemies wrack.

   KING. Guise, weare our crowne, and be thou King of France,
   And as Dictator make or warre or peace,
   Whilste I cry placet like a Senator.
   I cannot brook thy hauty insolence,
   Dismisse thy campe or else by our Edict,
   Be thou proclaimde a traitor throughout France.

   GUISE. The choyse is hard, I must dissemble.

        [Aside.]

   My Lord, in token of my true humilitie,
   And simple meaning to your Majestie,
   I kisse your graces hand, and take my leave,
   Intending to dislodge my campe with speed.

   KING. Then farwell Guise, the King and thou art freends.

        Exit Guise.

   EPERNOUNE. But trust him not my Lord,
   For had your highnesse seene with what a pompe
   He entred Paris, and how the Citizens
   With gifts and shewes did entertaine him
   And promised to be at his commaund:
   Nay, they fear'd not to speak in the streetes,
   That Guise ch, durst stand in armes against the King,
   For not effecting of his holines will.

   KING. Did they of Paris entertaine him so?
   Then meanes he present treason to our state.
   Well, let me alone, whose within there?

       Enter one with e pen and inke.

   Make a discharge of all my counsell straite,
   And Ile subscribe my name and seale it straight.
   My head shall be my counsell, they are false:
   And Epernoune I will be rulde by thee.

   EPERNOUNE. My Lord,
   I think for safety of your person,
   It would be good the Guise were made away,
   And so to quite your grace of all suspect.

   KING. First let us set our hand and seale to this,
   And then Ile tell thee what I meane to doe.

        He writes.

   So, convey this to the counsell presently.

        Exit one.

   And Epernoune though I seeme milde and calme,
   Thinke not but I am tragicall within:
   Ile secretly convey me unto Bloyse,
   For now that Paris takes the Guises parse,
   Heere is not staying for the King of France,
   Unles he means to be betraide and dye:
   But as I live, so sure the Guise shall dye.

        Exeunt.





[Scene xviii]


        Enter the King of Navarre reading of a letter, and Bartus.

   NAVARRE. My Lord, I am advertised from France,
   That the Guise hath taken armes against the King,
   And that Paris is revolted from his grace.

   BARTUS. Then hath your grace fit oportunitie,
   To shew your love unto the King of France:
   Offering him aide against his enemies,
   Which cannot but be thankfully receiv'd.

   NAVARRE. Bartus, it shall be so, poast then to Fraunce,
   And there salute his highnesse in our name,
   Assure him all the aide we can provide,
   Against the Guisians and their complices.
   Bartus be gone, commend me to his grace,
   And tell him ere it be long, Ile visite him.

   BARTUS. I will my Lord.

        Exit.

   NAVARRE. Pleshe.

        Enter Pleshe.

   PLESHE. My Lord.

   NAVARRE. Pleshe, goe muster up our men with speed,
   And let them march away to France amaine:
   For we must aide the King against the Guise.
   Be gone I say, tis time that we were there.

   PLESHE. I goe my Lord.

        [Exit.]

   NAVARRE. That wicked Guise I feare me much will be,
   The wine of that famous Realme of France:
   For his aspiring thoughts aime at the crowne,
   He takes his vantage on Religion,
   To plant the Pope and popelings in the Realme,
   And binde it wholy to the Sea of Rome:
   But if that God doe prosper mine attempts,
   And send us safely to arrive in France:
   Wee'l beat him back, and drive him to his death,
   That basely seekes the wine of his Realme.

        Exit.





[Scene xix]


        Enter the Captaine of the guarde, and three murtherers.

   CAPTAINE. Come on sirs, what, are you resolutely bent,
   Hating the life and honour of the Guise?
   What, will you not feare when you see him come?

   1. Feare him said you? tush, were he heere, we would kill him
   presently.

   2. O that his heart were leaping in my hand.

   31. But when will he come that we may murther him?

   CAPTAINE. Well then, I see you are resolute.

   1. Let us alone, I warrant you.

   CAPTAINE. Then sirs take your standings within this Chamber,
   For anon the Guise will come.

   ALL. You will give us our money?

   CAPTAINE. I, I, feare not: stand close, be resolute:

        [The murtherers go aside as if in the next room.]

   Now fals the star whose influence governes France,
   Whose light was deadly to the Protestants:
   Now must he fall and perish in his height.

        Enter the King and Epernoune.

   KING. Now Captain of my guarde, are these murtherers ready?

   CAPTAINE. They be my good Lord.

   KING. But are they resolute and armde to kill,
   Hating the life and honour of the Guise?

   CAPTAINE. I warrant you my Lord.

        [Exit.]

   KING. Then come proud Guise and heere disgordge thy brest,
   Surchargde with surfet of ambitious thoughts:
   Breath out that life wherein my death was hid,
   And end thy endles treasons with thy death.

        Enter the Guise [within] and knocketh.

   GUISE. Holla varlet, hey: Epernoune, where is the King?

   EPERNOUNE. Mounted his royall Cabonet.

   GUISE. I prethee tell him that the Guise is heere.

   EPERNOUNE. And please your grace the Duke of Guise doth crave
   Accesse unto your highnes.

   KING. Let him come in.
   Come Guise and see thy traiterous guile outreacht,
   And perish in the pit thou mad'st for me.

        The Guise comes to the King.

   GUISE. Good morrow to your Majestie.

   KING. Good morrow to my loving Cousin of Guise.
   How fares it this morning with your excellence?

   GUISE. I heard your Majestie was scarcely pleasde,
   That in the Court I bear so great a traine.

   KING. They were to blame that said I was displeasde,
   And you good Cosin to imagine it.
   Twere hard with me if I should doubt my kinne,
   Or be suspicious of my deerest freends:
   Cousin, assure you I am resolute,
   Whatever any whisper in mine eares,
   Not to suspect disloyaltye in thee,
   And so sweet Cuz farwell.

        Exit King [and Epernoune].

   GUISE. So,
   Now sues the King for favour to the Guise,
   And all his Minions stoup when I commaund:
   Why this tis to have an army in the fielde.
   Now by the holy sacrament I sweare,
   As ancient Romanes over their Captive Lords,
   So will I triumph over this wanton King,
   And he shall follow my proud Chariots wheeles.
   Now doe I but begin to look about,
   And all my former time was spent in vaine:
   Holde Sworde,
   For in thee is the Guises hope.

        Enter one of the Murtherers.

   Villaine, why cost thou look so gastly? speake.

   3. O pardon me my Lord of Guise.

   GUISE. Pardon thee, why what hast thou done?

   3. O my Lord, I am one of them that is set to murder you.

   GUISE. To murder me, villaine?

   3. I my Lord, the rest have taine their standings in the next
   roome, therefore good my Lord goe not foorth.

   GUISE. Yet Caesar shall goe forth.
   Let mean consaits, and baser men feare death,
   Tut they are pesants, I am Duke of Guise:
   And princes with their lookes ingender feare.

   2 MURD. Stand close, he is comming, I know him by his voice.

   GUISE. As pale as ashes, nay then tis time to look about.

   ALL. Downe with him, downe with him.

        They stabbe him.

   GUISE. Oh I have my death wound, give me leave to speak.

   2. Then pray to God, and aske forgivenes of the King.

   GUISE. Trouble me not, I neare offended him,
   Nor will I aske forgivenes of the King.
   Oh that I have not power to stay my life,
   Nor immortalitie to be reveng'd:
   To dye by Pesantes, what a greefe is this?
   Ah Sextus, be reveng'd upon the King,
   Philip and Parma, I am slaine for you:
   Pope excommunicate, Philip depose,
   The wicked branch of curst Valois's line.
   Vive la messe, perish Hugonets,
   Thus Caesar did goe foorth, and thus he dies.

        He dyes.

        Enter Captaine of the Guarde.

   CAPTAINE. What, have you done?
   Then stay a while and Ile goe call the King,

        [Enter King and Epernoune attended.]

   But see where he comes.
   My Lord, see where the Guise is slaine.

   KING. Oh this sweet sight is phisick to my soule,
   Goe fetch his sonne for to beholde his death:

        [Exit attendant.]

   Surchargde with guilt of thousand massacres,
   Mounser of Loraine sinke away to hell,
   In just remembrance of those bloudy broyles,
   To which thou didst alure me being alive:
   And heere in presence of you all I sweare,
   I nere was King of France untill this houre:
   This is the traitor that hath spent my golde,
   In making forraine warres and cruel broiles.
   Did he not draw a sorte of English priestes
   From Doway to the Seminary at Remes,
   To hatch forth treason gainst their naturall Queene?
   Did he not cause the King of Spaines huge fleete,
   To threaten England and to menace me?
   Did he not injure Mounser thats deceast?
   Hath he not made me in the Popes defence,
   To spend the treasure that should strength my land,
   In civill broiles between Navarre and me?
   Tush, to be short, he meant to make me Munke,
   Or else to murder me, and so be King.
   Let Christian princes that shall heare of this,
   (As all the world shall know our Guise is dead)
   Rest satisfed with this that heer I sweare,
   Nere was there King of France so yoakt as I.

   EPERNOUNE. My Lord heer is his sonne.

        Enter the Guises sonne.

   KING. Boy, look where your father lyes.

   YONG GUISE. My father slaine, who hath done this deed?

   KING. Sirra twas I that slew him, and will slay
   Thee too, and thou prove such a traitor.

   YONG GUISE. Art thou King, and hast done this bloudy deed?
   Ile be revengde.

        He offereth to throwe his dagger.

   KING. Away to prison with him, Ile clippe his winges
   Or ere he passe my handes, away with him.

        Exit Boy.

   But what availeth that this traitors dead,
   When Duke Dumaine his brother is alive,
   And that young Cardinall that is growne so proud?
   Goe to the Governour of Orleance,
   And will him in my name to kill the Duke.

        [Exit Captaine of the Guarde.]

   Get you away and strangle the Cardinall.

        [Exit murtherers.]

   These two will make one entire Duke of Guise,
   Especially with our olde mothers helpe.

   EPERNOUNE. My Lord, see where she comes, as if she droupt
   To heare these newest

        Enter Queene Mother [attended].

   KING. And let her croup, my heart is light enough.
   Mother, how like you this device of mine?
   I slew the Guise, because I would be King.

   QUEENE MOTHER. King, why so thou wert before.
   Pray God thou be a King now this is done.

   KING. Nay he was King and countermanded me,
   But now I will be King and rule my selfe,
   And make the Guisians stoup that are alive.

   QUEENE MOTHER. I cannot speak for greefe: when thou went home,
   I would that I had murdered thee my sonne.
   My sonne: thou art a changeling, not my sonne.
   I curse thee and exclaime thee miscreant,
   Traitor to God, and to the realme of France.

   KING. Cry out, exclaime, houle till thy throat be hoarce,
   The Guise is slaine, and I rejoyce therefore:
   And now will I to armes, come Epernoune:
   And let her greeve her heart out if she will.

        Exit the King and Epernoune.

   QUEENE MOTHER. Away, leave me alone to meditate.
   Sweet Guise, would he had died so thou wert heere:
   To whom shall I bewray my secrets now,
   Or who will helpe to builde Religion?
   The Protestants will glory and insulte,
   Wicked Navarre will get the crowne of France,
   The Popedome cannot stand, all goes to wrack,
   And all for thee my Guise: what may I doe?
   But sorrow seaze upon my toyling soule,
   For since the Guise is dead, I will not live.

        Exit [the attendants taking up body of the Guise].





[Scene xx]


        Enter two [Murtherers] dragging in the Cardenall [of Loraine].

   CARDINALL. Murder me not, I am a Cardenall.

   1. Wert thou the Pope thou mightst not scape from us.

   CARDINALL. What, will you fyle your handes with Churchmens bloud?

   2. Shed your bloud,
   O Lord no: for we entend to strangle you.

   CARDINALL. Then there is no remedye but I must dye?

   1. No remedye, therefore prepare your selfe.

   CARDINALL. Yet lives
   My brother Duke Dumaine, and many moe:
   To revenge our deaths upon that cursed King,
   Upon whose heart may all the furies gripe,
   And with their pawes drench his black soule in hell.

   1. Yours my Lord Cardinall, you should have saide.

        Now they strangle him.

   So, pluck amaine,
   He is hard hearted, therfore pull with violence.
   Come take him away.

      Exeunt.





[Scene xxi]


        Enter Duke Dumayn reading of a letter, with others.

   DUMAINE. My noble brother murthered by the King,
   Oh what may I doe, to revenge thy death?
   The Kings alone, it cannot satisfie.
   Sweet Duke of Guise our prop to leane upon,
   Now thou art dead, heere is no stay for us:
   I am thy brother, and ile revenge thy death,
   And roote Valois's line from forth of France,
   And beate proud Burbon to his native home,
   That basely seekes to joyne with such a King,
   Whose murderous thoughts will be his overthrow.
   Hee wild the Governour of Orleance in his name,
   That I with speed should have beene put to death.
   But thats prevented, for to end his life,
   And all those traitors to the Church of Rome,
   That durst attempt to murder noble Guise.

        Enter the Frier.

   FRIER. My Lord, I come to bring you newes, that your brother
   the Cardinall of Loraine by the Kings consent is lately strangled
   unto death.

   DUMAINE. My brother Cardenall slaine and I alive?
   O wordes of power to kill a thousand men.
   Come let us away and leavy men,
   Tis warre that must asswage the tyrantes pride.

   FRIER. My Lord, heare me but speak.
   I am a Frier of the order of the Jacobyns, that for my
   conscience sake will kill the King.

   DUMAINE. But what doth move thee above the rest to doe the deed?

   FRIER. O my Lord, I have beene a great sinner in my dayes, and
   the deed is meritorious.

   DUMAINE. But how wilt thou get opportunitye?

   FRIER. Tush my Lord, let me alone for that.

   DUMAINE. Frier come with me,
   We will goe talke more of this within.

        Exeunt.





[Scene xxii]


        Sound Drumme and Trumpets, and enter the King of France,
        and Navarre, Epernoune, Bartus, Pleshe and Souldiers.

   KING. Brother of Navarre, I sorrow much,
   That ever I was prov'd your enemy,
   And that the sweet and princely minde you beare,
   Was ever troubled with injurious warres:
   I vow as I am lawfull King of France,
   To recompence your reconciled love,
   With all the honors and affections,
   That ever I vouchsafte my dearest freends.

   NAVARRE. It is enough if that Navarre may be
   Esteemed faithfull to the King of France:
   Whose service he may still commaund to death.

   KING. Thankes to my Kingly Brother of Navarre.
   Then there wee'l lye before Lutetia's walles,
   Girting this strumpet Cittie with our siege,
   Till surfeiting with our afflicting armes,
   She cast her hatefull stomack to the earth.

        Enter a Messenger.

   MESSENGER. And it please your Majestie heere is a Frier of the
   order of the Jacobins, sent from the President of Paris, that
   craves accesse unto your grace.

   KING. Let him come in.

        Enter Frier with a Letter.

   EPERNOUNE. I like not this Friers look.
   Twere not amisse my Lord, if he were searcht.

   KING. Sweete Epernoune, our Friers are holy men,
   And will not offer violence to their King,
   For all the wealth and treasure of the world.
   Frier, thou dost acknowledge me thy King?

   FRIER. I my good Lord, and will dye therein.

   KING. Then come thou neer, and tell what newes thou bringst.

   FRIER. My Lord,
   The President of Paris greetes your grace,
   And sends his dutie by these speedye lines,
   Humblye craving your gracious reply.

   KING. Ile read them Frier, and then Ile answere thee.

   FRIER. Sancte Jacobus, now have mercye on me.

        He stabs the King with a knife as he readeth the letter, and
        then the King getteth the knife and killes him.

   EPERNOUNE. O my Lord, let him live a while.

   KING. No, let the villaine dye, and feele in hell,
   Just torments for his trechery.

   NAVARRE. What, is your highnes hurt?

   KING. Yes Navarre, but not to death I hope.

   NAVARRE. God shield your grace from such a sodaine death:
   Goe call a surgeon hether strait.

        [Exit attendant.]

   KING. What irreligeous Pagans partes be these,
   Of such as horde them of the holy church?
   Take hence that damned villaine from my sight.

        [Exeunt attendants with body]

   EPERNOUNE. Ah, had your highnes let him live,
   We might have punisht him for his deserts.

   KING. Sweet Epernoune all Rebels under heaven,
   Shall take example by his punishment,
   How they beare armes against their soveraigne.
   Goe call the English Agent hether strait,
   Ile send my sister England newes of this,
   And give her warning of her trecherous foes.

        [Enter Surgeon.]

   NAVARRE. Pleaseth your grace to let the Surgeon search your wound.

   KING. The wound I warrant you is deepe my Lord,
   Search Surgeon and resolve me what thou seest.

        The Surgeon searcheth.

        Enter the English Agent.

   Agent for England, send thy mistres word,
   What this detested Jacobin hath done.
   Tell her for all this that I hope to live,
   Which if I doe, the Papall Monarck goes
   To wrack, an antechristian kingdome falles.
   These bloudy hands shall teare his triple Crowne,
   And fire accursed Rome about his eares.
   Ile fire his erased buildings and incense
   The papall towers to kisse the holy earth.
   Navarre, give me thy hand, I heere do sweare,
   To ruinate this wicked Church of Rome,
   That hatcheth up such bloudy practices.
   And heere protest eternall love to thee,
   And to the Queene of England especially,
   Whom God hath blest for hating Popery.

   NAVARRE. These words revive my thoughts and comfort me,
   To see your highnes in this vertuous minde.

   KING. Tell me Surgeon, shall I live?

   SURGEON. Alas my Lord, the wound is dangerous,
   For you are stricken with a poysoned knife.

   KING. A poysoned knife? what, shall the French king dye,
   Wounded and poysoned, both at once?

   EPERNOUNE. O that that damned villaine were alive againe,
   That we might torture him with some new found death.

   BARTUS. He died a death too good, the devill of hell
   Torture his wicked soule.

   KING. Oh curse him not since he is dead.
   O the fatall poyson workes within my brest,
   Tell me Surgeon and flatter not, may I live?

   SURGEON. Alas my Lord, your highnes cannot live.

   NAVARRE. Surgeon, why saist thou so? the King may live.

   KING. Oh no Navarre, thou must be King of France.

   NAVARRE. Long may you live, and still be King of France.

   EPERNOUNE. Or else dye Epernoune.

   KING. Sweet Epernoune thy King must dye. My Lords,
   Fight in the quarrell of this valiant Prince,
   For he is your lawfull King and my next heire:
   Valoyses lyne ends in my tragedie.
   Now let the house of Bourbon weare the crowne,
   And may it never end in bloud as mine hath done.
   Weep not sweet Navarre, but revenge my death.
   Ah Epernoune, is this thy love to me?
   Henry thy King wipes of these childish teares,
   And bids thee whet thy sword on Sextus bones,
   That it may keenly slice the Catholicks.
   He loves me not the best that sheds most teares,
   But he that makes most lavish of his bloud.
   Fire Paris where these trecherous rebels lurke.
   I dye Navarre, come beare me to my Sepulchre.
   Salute the Queene of England in my name,
   And tell her Henry dyes her faithfull freend.

        He dyes.

   NAVARRE. Come Lords, take up the body of the King,
   That we may see it honourably interde:
   And then I vow so to revenge his death,
   That Rome and all those popish Prelates there,
   Shall curse the time that ere Navarre was King,
   And rulde in France by Henries fatall death.

        They march out with the body of the King, lying on foure
        mens shoulders with a dead march, drawing weapons on
        the ground.




        FINIS.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
